<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday Brett Terpstra <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/">officially announced</a> that he quit his job and is heading out on his own as an independent writer, developer and man about the web. He is asking for <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/support/">your support</a> in this new endeavor. Go thank Brett with kind words, a cup of coffee or, hell, a new Mac Pro if you can swing it. Or go buy <a href="http://marked2app.com">Marked 2</a>, his excellent Markdown preview (and so much more) app.</p>

<p>I want to tell just a small story about Brett.</p>

<p>Back in May of 2012 I noticed on Twitter that Brett was in New York City for a work thing. I told him I was around if he had time to kill and he obliged. We set a time and place down in the East Village to meet.</p>

<p>This was after <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/02/08/fountain-for-marked/">Fountain for Marked</a>. By then I had thought of Brett as an “Internet friend,” which is to say someone I could tweet at who might tweet back but probably wouldn’t listen to my life story over whiskey.</p>

<p>When I met Brett he was with a work friend. Not knowing what’s good they told me to pick a place we could sit and have a drink. I took them to <a href="http://www.mcsorleysnewyork.com/home.html">McSorley’s Old Ale House</a>, something of a tourist trap with sawdust on the floor that only serves small glasses of their house beer. It was a bit of a mistake on my part but we got a round and got to talking.</p>

<p>Text editors, apps, code, bloggers; we covered it all. I remember not knowing, at the time, whether or not <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com">Macdrifter’s</a> identity was public. It seems so long ago now; Gabe Weatherhead has since become another of my Internet friends. Eventually we changed venues to one of my favorite bars where the conversation continued over a few more drinks.</p>

<p>On our walk back the time came for us to split ways. I was headed to the subway, Brett and his co-worker were headed back to their hotel. When it came time to say goodbye, I offered the usual pleasantries. “Nice to finally meet you” and “great hanging out” and so forth.</p>

<p>Brett offered the same and one more. I’d like to say I’ll never forget what Brett told me but the truth is I don’t recall his exact words, just the sentiment. He said something along the lines of: “I like what you do. So keep on doing it.” When he said it I could tell that he had heard this advice before and it had impacted him. Brett wasn’t complementing me, he was encouraging me.</p>

<p>I tell this now to show what kind of a person Brett Terpstra is. Even the breadth of his free <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/">projects</a> don’t quite get to what a giving person he is. On his <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic">podcast</a> he invites listeners to come on as guests; on his site he <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/12/23/a-few-of-my-favorite-mac-apps-in-2013/">points readers</a> to numerous unknown apps and developers; on <a href="http://twitter.com/ttscoff/">Twitter</a> he is always willing to lend a helping hand, even if only to <a href="https://twitter.com/ttscoff/status/327597788059811841">recommend a great whiskey</a>. And in private he’s there with a kind word to help you on your way, <em>even</em> if you take him to one of the crappiest bars in New York.</p>

<p>Brett is a real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch">mensch</a> who has given so much to so many. Consider sending <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/support/">something</a> back his way.</p>

<p>Best of luck, Brett. And thanks for everything.</p>
