<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/Dinner_for_Schmucks.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/Dinner_for_Schmucks-
300x199.jpg" alt="Dinner for Schmucks Still" /></a>Halfway through the summer our
cinematic bloodlust has been sated: heroes worshiped, vampires sucked dry,
minds thoroughly fucked. Now, at long last, the time has come to be tickled,
and director Jay Roach delivers big with <em>Dinner for Schmucks</em>, undoubtedly
the biggest laugh-fest of the season. The plot is weak and the resolution full
of tired cornballery, but just as with his other franchises, <em>Austin Powers</em>
and <em>Meet the Parents</em>, Roach shows off his uncany ability to craft taut comic
setpieces, each more involved and convoluted than the next.</p>

<p>Paul Rudd plays Tim Conrad, a “stock broker, or something” looking to rise to
the heighst of the seventh floor by reeling in $100 million Swedish client.
The only thing between Tim and a juicy promotion is an idiot for a monthly
dinner held by his boss, in which a cabal of douchebags gathers to make fun of
the dumbest guest. To appease his kindhearted girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak),
Tim turns the dinner down until he (literally) runs into Barry Speck, a
lovable doofus played by Steve Carell. An amateur taxidermist who fits
deceased rodents into his “mouseterpieces”, Barry turns out to be the perfect
person to get Tim’s foot in the door. As he has done consistently ever since
his smash success with <em>40-Year Old Virgin</em>, Carell shines. Though Barry
shares a number of ticks and mannerisms with <em>The Office’s</em> Michael Scott,
there is no question that he is a wholly original take on the empathetic
schlemiel.</p>

<p>No matter how hard he tries, Barry cannot do anything right. Almost
immediately he brings Tim to the brink of destruction. He invites over an
insane stalker (played by the brilliant Lucy Punch, who probably has the most
laughs-per-minute in the film), tells Tim’s girlfriend to take a hike and
plays a part in destroying most of his living room. Of course, in trying to
fix everything Barry only makes things worse. The premise is as old as comedy
itself, but it is the players that all make it work so well here. In
particular there is a scene at a brunch meeting that provided one of the best
belly laughs I’ve had in awhile. You see the whole trainwreck predictable
unfurling, you just don’t think they will let the joke go that far; no one is
that unlucky. But they do, and we get to relish in the worst-case scanario
that is Tim’s weekend.</p>

<p>Now what’s up with that title? As I suspected, Barry Speck is classically
defined as a schlemiel; an unintetionally awkward nudnik. Schmuck is much more
visceral, much more derogratory. And then it dawned on me: the dinner is <em>for</em>
the schmucks; the douchebags. Their guests are the hapless schlemiels. Enter
the cornballery I mentioned earlier. <em>Dinner for Schmucks</em> is ultimately a
moral tale, one about showing your true colors and not judging books by covers
and other vomit inducing crap. If it were trying to live up to its Yiddishe
title, the whole of the story would serve as an open-ended joke on the viewer.
Instead it ties itself up in a neat little resolution.</p>

<p>Though <em>Schmucks</em> borrows a great deal from the film on which it is based,
Francis Veber’s <em>The Dinner Game</em>, it serves as another example of American
resolutions and how they differ from their European counterparts. Veber’s film
ends with a joke, one which gets the idiot back into all of the trouble he
started. Also, Rudd’s character is allowed to be a nice guy the whole time,
dipping into his dark side when necessary (“The Tim you don’t know”) to move
his status forward. In the original, the Rudd character is a complete asshole
who gets his comeuppance. In other words, the whole message is backwards. The
French jokes come from a much darker place than Roach’s. While this is not
necessarily a bat thing, the <em>Schmucks</em> smacks of saccharine in its final
frame.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the laughs are so tight I’ll set all of that aside. Roach’s
talent is constructing scenes and splendid looking from afar as a Rube
Goldberg machine. Seeing the likely outcome before anything happens (knowing
the sex-crazed stalker will screw everything up, recognizing that a blind
fencer could lead to no good, etc.) adds immensely to the delight of watching
the jokes come to life. For all its shortcomings, I laughed my ass off at this
film. Undoubtedly, it will be <em>the</em> summer comedy of 2010.</p>
