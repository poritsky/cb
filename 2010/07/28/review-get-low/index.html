<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/get_low_01.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/get_low_01-300x200.jpg" alt="Get Low Still" /></a>Shortly after I saw Aaron
Schneider’s 1930s period piece <em>Get Low</em> at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival,
I coyly tweeted the following summation of the film: Boo Radley speaks. That
character was the first role Robert Duvall ever had in Robert Mulligan’s
adaptation of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. In the years since, he has enjoyed an
illustrious career at the crest of nearly every creative wave that has swept
over tinsel town. In Mr. Schneider’s film he plays Felix Bush, a Tennesse
recluse as enigmatic as Harper Lee’s Radley looking to reintegrate with the
town surrounding him before his last days. The trouble is, the more I play the
film over in my head, the more I understand why Boo Radley is allowed only a
single line of dialogue instead of his own book: the allure behind society’s
outliers is in the mystery surrounding their status, rarely in the unfurling
of that tale.</p>

<p>At the film’s outset, we come to recognize Felix as the village kook; a beardy
old man who gets his kicks scaring the hell out of kids and adults alike.
Duvall wears curmudgeon well, snarling glassy eyed at all he meets. The beard
is a mask, a source of power for him. Denied redemption from a holy man, Felix
heads to the next best thing: a money hungry funeral director, Frank Quinn,
played by Bill Murray, who doffs his signature deadpan smirk. Bush and Quinn
hatch a plan to have the whole town come out to celebrate Felix’s funeral,
only while he is still alive. Unorthodox, yes, but Felix is essentially
sitting on piles of cash which Frank can’t wait to get his hands on. And so
the game is on.</p>

<p>First order of business, unfortunately, is to lose Felix’s beard. Now, Duvall
is Duvall with or without a great big beard, but everything seems to change
for some reason once it goes away. It is much easier to understand Felix, to
relate to him, once he looks like everybody else, which frustrates me. His
aged, bare face warrants empathy immediately, which is just too easy. There is
no real obstacle for the townspeople; why not go to the living funeral of the
weak-looking rich old man?</p>

<p>Sissy Spacek plays Mattie Darrow, one of the only people in the town who
smiles when she sees Felix. She is also one of the only people who knows the
truth about his past, about the events that turned him into a recluse. The
role comes with a lot of baggage, but Ms. Spacek is up to the task. Her and
Mr. Duvall put on a wonderful show, including a lovely candlelit scene. In
both their cases, and even moreso for Bill Murray, the trick to their
performances is in their eyes. The toughest way to transcend stardom and enter
a new character is to get your eyes to do the talking <em>as</em> someone else. The
leads here are all incredible talents who deliver to-rate performance, which
more likely than not will earn at least a few nomination come awards season.</p>

<p>In the end, however, <em>Get Low</em> is a story about a story, and not such an
involved one at that. The whole film, we are promised a payoff at the end, as
the whole town is. What makes Felix Bush tick? It is hinted at throughout, but
never in a meaningful way. Instead Mr. Schneider and writer Chris Provenzano
and C. Gaby Mitchell save the whole of his tale for the hurried ending, which
does not quite live up to the anticipation. It is billed as a reveal, only
nothing is revealed at that point that we didn’t already know, except of
course the intentionally held back facts.</p>

<p>It seems out of place for a film as emotionally driven as this one to rely on
simple facts, the simple narrative of Felix Bush, as harshly as it does. It is
a confusing mix to be sure, and one that will please some and frustrate
others. The leads pull this film through right up to the bitter end, but even
the high points can’t fix the jumbled narrative</p>
