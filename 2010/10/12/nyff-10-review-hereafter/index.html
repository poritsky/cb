<div class="entry-content"><p><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/10/hereafter-movie.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10
/hereafter-movie-300x226.jpg" alt="Hereafter Still" /></a>Hereafter</em> is Clint Eastwood’s
latest soapbox, proving that the octogenarian director has neither lost his
flare for the dramatic nor his moralistic pulpit. In the film’s opening
moments, he provides perhaps his most technically resplendent sequence,
executing a massive natural disaster, a tsunami, with a camera that whips and
winds with the current of an overflowing sea. Yet from that point on, the
curmudgeonly Eastwood we have come to know in the past decade drags out a
boring tale of love, loss and the afterlife. It is, to say the least, a
snooze.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of one of the easiest ways of duping an audience into
thinking they are watching a tale of emotional discovery,  <em>Hereafter</em> relies
on intertwining, seemingly unrelated plot lines. There are three in this film.
George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a San Francisco based psychic trying to lay low
after a successful run as a supernatural healer. Marie LeLay (Cécile De
France) is a Parisian news anchor (and Blackberry spokeswoman) whose extreme
brush with death leads her to put her career on hold. Finally, Marcus and
Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) are precocious twins who try to keep their
deadbeat mother in shape lest they be swept off by child services. The trick
is to keep the plot moving forward in each story line, usually at the expense
of character development. The trouble is that no one plot stands out above the
rest, and their collision at the end is completely nonsensical.</p>

<p>Viewers may not be surprised to learn that Steven Spielberg played the role of
Executive Producer on this film. Given his penchant for dabbling in projects
under his purview, I wouldn’t be surprised if the aforementioned opening
sequence didn’t have at least a little bit of his direction. As the tsunami
breaks through an entire civilization, our perspective remains steady,
changing only as emotionally necessary. Given the scope of the destruction, it
sounds simpler than it actually is to pull this off. It is a powerhouse
sequence, that is until a teddy bear turns into some kind of god-like
talisman. Ironically, this is when it turns into a disaster film.</p>

<p><em>Hereafter</em> also hinges on a very Spielbergian concept: heartache. Given that
we know this is a story dealing with life after death, Eastwood immediately
plays on our emotions. He lets us know that someone, if not everyone, will die
before our eyes, but not before we gain an emotional connection to them. Those
who have vilified Spielberg for this in the past will go on the attack if only
for the excruciating introduction of Marcus and Jason, whose dreary lives are
almost sure to end in horror. To make matters worse, for all the shoes that
could have dropped on these people, for all the monsters lurking in closets,
the one we end up with is eminently banal.</p>

<p>I’m not going to talk about performances; they’re all serviceable but none are
stellar. Now it’s time to turn attention to perhaps the most surprising
misstepper in this hard-to-love film: Peter Morgan. One of Britain’s top
A-listers, it’s hard to believe that the drivel on screen came from his gifted
pen. His fatal mistake is that the afterlife is dealt with as both a religious
and a scientific reality. He doesn’t go to any lengths to defend either
viewpoint. For example, a “scientist and atheist” in the film provides
incontrovertible evidence that there is in fact life after death, but we are
never allowed to look at that evidence. Moreover, we are never given the
boundaries of this world of the dead. Instead, it remains unknown and
uninteresting throughout. This kind of film requires the grounding of Science
Fiction, a suspension of disbelief that is entirely unemotional. Morgan did
not provide.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Hereafter</em> falls flat for its weak story. Clint Eastwood remains
an icon and a talented, steady director. When George takes on a client of his
brother’s (Richard Kind as the client, Jay Mohr as his brother) the scene is
dark, quiet and moody. He plays in the dark and can build a beautiful scene
out of the thinnest of dialogue. In the end, however, it isn’t enough to
overcome a story that will have you unintentionally rolling on the floor by
the overwrought ending. “Is this for real?” was my internal monologue as the
music crescendoed and credits took over. Alarmingly, yes, it is.</p>
