<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

content/uploads/2010/11/apreture3promo.jpg" alt="Aperture 3 Promotional Still from Apple's
Website" /></a>Last week I listed my hopes for
early 2011’s iteration of Final Cut Studio. I’ve gotten some great feedback
for more additions folks would like, especially on <a href="http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/area-51/487396-wish-list-2011-final-cut-
studio.html">this
thread</a> over at DVInfo.net. The two biggest cries seemed to be for 64-bit
applications across the board and GPU acceleration, which are both long
overdue at this point. However, I’d like to focus just on the unchanged
interface of Final Cut Pro for now by looking at Apple’s other major creative
app, Aperture.</p>

<h2 id="when-stills-arent-still-anymore">When Stills Aren’t Still Anymore</h2>

<p>Back in 2008, the photography gurus over at The Luminous Landscape posted an
article called <a href="http://www.luminous-
landscape.com/essays/red-raw.shtml">Raw Goes to the Movies</a>. In it, they lay out the similarities
between the Red One camera and digital SLR technology. The key quote comes
from a disclaimer at the head of the piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are significant implications for the still photography industry in the
RED One and its kin, so if some insights into the future of our industry is of
interest, read on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the RED One came the Nikon D90, followed by the much-lauded Canon 5D
Mark II. Now, you can’t make a DSLR without adding HD video. And so we have
two kinds of artists, photographers and filmmakers, converging on the same
products. I know folks who rarely shoot video with their SLRs and some who
rarely shoot stills. It’s a completely different landscape than it was just a
few years ago. Production gear may be moving to meet the needs of filmmakers,
but post-production solutions have been slow to follow.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the transition from tape to tapeless has been building
post-production software that can keep up with the advances in cameras. When
Panasonic introduced their P2 format, most were excited that the hassles of
tape would go away. Instead, what we found was that, at least in Final Cut,
the digital files still had to be transcoded, a process that took only a bit
less time than capturing tapes. Things have only gotten worse as digital
formats have proliferated. The files out of Canon’s HDSLRs are compressed
H.264s. While they look absolutely stunning, they don’t take as well to color
correction as tape formats, they still require transcoding in order to be
smoothly edited, and their lack of timecode makes it impossible to match back
to your camera “raw” files. At least, that’s the way things are today.</p>

<h2 id="photo-editing-for-film-editors">Photo Editing for Film Editors</h2>

<p>In Aperture’s parlance, “photo editing” is the process of selecting which
photos stay and which will go. “Image editing” is when you get in there and
start adjusting colors, curves and anything else you like. I’ll leave it to
armchair lexicographers to argue the nominal differences between the terms.</p>

<p>Filmmaking is an extremely old school game, mired in a century of tradition.
Our digital editing platforms are all based around language that comes from
cutting film my hand. Clip, Bin, and even Viewer are all terms that relate to
physical pieces found in an old editing suite. When we went to cutting tape
instead of film, the format may have changed but the process barely did.
Tapeless workflows, especially for files coming out of HDSLRs, are radically
different.</p>

<p>With Aperture 3, Apple introduced the ability for photographers to ingest all
of their video files alongside their photos. Once inside of Aperture, videos
can be trimmed, tagged, rated, and placed into HD slideshows. They can also be
exported for editing in Final Cut Pro, but this process is a bit more
laborious than Apple lets on. Aperture 2 only offered to place any non-photo
files into a specified directory outside of the photo library. Now, it treats
video as if it were a photo that moves.</p>

<p>Imagine a video library for each Final Cut project that is self-contained,
much like the Aperture Library. In it you could tag media, hide clips you
don’t like, and update metadata quickly in an interface that mimics Aperture.
While you can certainly edit metadata in Final Cut today, the Browser window
is cramped. Even when you have a monitor big enough to stretch it out, it’s
tough to get anywhere without a right click. The simplicity of photo editing
in Aperture, Adobe’s Lightroom and similar applications is something that
could make media organization for video editors a breeze.</p>

<h2 id="final-aperture-pro-the-perfect-final-cut-8">Final Aperture Pro, The Perfect Final Cut 8?</h2>

<p>Aperture 3 is 64-bit, exists within one unified window and sports a slick
full-screen interface, three features that make it the perfect pro app for Mac
OS X 10.7 Lion. As I pointed out in <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/11/12/a-wish-list-for-the-2011-final-
cut-studio/">my Final Cut Studio wish
list</a>, Final Cut’s interface is still based around a Mac OS 9 design.
Whether we like it or not, the overall interface is do for an overhaul and I
have a feeling it’s going to, eventually, start looking a lot like Aperture 3.</p>

<p>When I bring this up to other working editors, the biggest fear is that they
would have to re-learn how to use Final Cut Pro. Most admit that the interface
has its drawbacks, but has ultimately won them over. Changing things
drastically would, unquestionably, alienate a lot of users. A few
counterpoints to that though:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You don’t have to upgrade. 2. You should never upgrade in the middle of a
project, ever, on any platform. 3. Change for the sake of change is bad, but
iterative interface upgrades aren’t inherently bad. 4. You <em>can</em> learn new
software; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Panic_(The_Hitchh
iker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)#Don.27t_Panic">don’t panic</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple, I hope, learned their lesson about drastically changing their
interfaces after they introduced iMovie ’08. They are not a company that makes
the same mistake twice, so don’t expect Final Cut 8 to be identical to
Aperture 3. I’m betting it will still look very similar to the same ol’ Final
Cut interface, but hopefully in one unified window that can make use of full
screen real-estate. The biggest update I’d like to see is a browser that looks
a lot more like Aperture, while keeping the actual tools of cutting the same
(or similar).</p>

<p>What Aperture does well is keep projects organized under one roof. Final Cut
is still based around a folder/bin structure that is up to the editor to
maintain. There are times when “Smart Folers”, organized on the fly by
metadata, would come in extremely handy in Final Cut. Photographers have the
luxury of software that is built to bring in all of their creative output,
whether it ends up being worth keeping around or not. Video editors, on the
other hand, can lose control very quickly when piles of media get sucked into
a bloated Final Cut project.</p>

<p>Documentaries for example have far more unused footage than fiction films
simply by the nature of how shooting one works. In an Aperture-like version of
Final Cut Pro, the documentarian can throw all of the footage he or she has
into a Final Cut project and begin tagging and/or rating the various takes.
Some films take years to shoot. With Final Cut as it stands now, it can be an
insurmountable task to organize all of that footage. In fact, it may be easier
to keep it organized outside of Final Cut. With a more robust organization
system, this process could become much simpler to handle.</p>

<p>A system like this could also, theoretically, cut out the lengthy transcoding
process filmmakers go through that leaves them with (at least) two sets of
media. I’d love to see a version of Final Cut that treats camera originals of
HDSLR video the same way it now treats RAW stills, in which the original files
are always accessible beneath whatever “version” is currently in use. This
could, potentially, subvert the need for real timecode on DSLRs, because your
camera originals would be linked by file name. It’s not a perfect solution,
but one that could work better that we have right now.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that when Apple introduced iMovie ’08’s much-maligned interface,
their intention was to judge how users took to it in hopes of making it the
future of their video editing applications. Some of that interface has made it
into Aperture 3’s design. The slideshow editor feels lifted straight out of
iMovie. The more I look at Aperture 3, the more I hope that Final Cut Pro 8
looks more like it than FCP 1.2.5. At the very least, it would be nice for the
two applications to have better integration so videos organized in Aperture
could be easily worked with in Final Cut. Given how related our SLRs and our
video cameras are these days, this seems to be an inevitability.</p>
