logo.jpg" alt="" /></a>Late last night a press release from the 2010 South by Southwest
(<a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a>, duh) Film Coference and Festival dropped into my
inbox. While we’re not usually in the business of delineating this kind of
info, this particular document is just so chock full of goodies, I figured it
was worth showing you the moment I could. This is the full list of shorts and
panels for the eight day fest this year, and the panels in particular sound
phenomenal. Quentin Tarantino, Michel Gondry and David Gordon Green are the
headliners, but don’t forget there are tons of other amazing talks scheduled.</p>

<p>The panel featuring Tarantino, “Directing the Dead: Genre Directors Spill
Their Guts” sounds particularly interesting. Actor Jeffrey Tambor will be
teaching his trade in a talk that I hope will feel like something the Scared
Straight talk on Arrested development. <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com">Gizmodo</a>
writer Joel Johnson will offer up some advice on music licensing for viral
videos and friend of the candler blog <a href="http://www.selfreliantfilm.com/">Paul
Harrill</a> (whose award winning short <em>Gina, an
Actress, Age 29</em> recently landed on
<a href="http://www.theauteurs.com/films/22436">theauteurs.com</a>) will be speaking
about “Cinematography for Improvised Films”. For those in attendance, there
certainly is a wide assortment of programming planned. I haven’t even
mentioned the shorts, but check out the full list after the break (it’s a long
one, be prepared). We still don’t know how much of the conference the candler
blog will be following, but we’ll be sure to keep you updated with the news.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>A Conversation with Michel Gondry</strong><br />
The stratospheric rise of Academy Award-winning visionary Michel Gondry is one
of the great success stories of modern film. Working with fellow travelers
like Spike Jonze, Charlie Kaufman and Bjork, Gondry has made his mark on the
film landscape with iconic work like <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>
and <em>The Science of Sleep</em>. Come and enjoy what promises to be a fascinating
discussion as Gondry discusses his latest, highly personal and emotionally raw
documentary <em>A Thorn in the Heart</em> with TCM’s Elvis Mitchell.</p>

<p><strong>Directing the Dead: Genre Directors Spill Their Guts</strong><br />
How does modern horror take gore beyond the purely grisly to the level of
grand guignol art and imagination?  How does bone-cracking violence and flesh-
rending horror contribute to the hallowed pantheon of art and cinema?  Join
five of the most striking genre filmmakers in modern movies as they lock horns
over the all-important issues of blood, guts and gratuitous gore.  Featuring
Ruben Fleischer (<em>Zombieland</em>), Matt Reeves (<em>Let Me In</em>) Eli Roth (<em>Hostel</em>),
Quentin Tarantino (<em>Inglorious Basterds</em>), Ti West (<em>House of the Devil</em>),
moderated by Scott Weinberg (Cinematical)</p>

<p><strong>Filmmakers in TV: A Case Study</strong><br />
Carving a niche in the world of film is tough enough, and achieving the same
feat on the small screen is no easier. Successfully mastering both is in yet
another league, but somehow the creators of HBO’s <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> are
pulling it off with style.  Find out how Danny McBride (<em>Your Highness</em>), and
filmmakers David Gordon Green (<em>Pineapple Express</em>) and Jody Hill (<em>Observe
and Report</em>) made it look easy in this illuminating, entertaining glimpse at
the art of combining technical skill, sharp comedy writing and moving from the
packed auditorium to the living room couch.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Graphic Novel Hollywood Will Buy</strong><br />
Graphic novels are red hot in Hollywood now. With its combination of words and
visuals in one attractive package, a comic book can be a great sales tool when
pitching your project to studios. Ean Mering (Pomegranate) talks to David Wohl
(Radical Publishing), Martin Shapiro (Night Owl Productions), Matt Hawkins
(Top Cow) and Ted Adams (IDW Publishing) will explain how to create a graphic
novel that will attract the attention of movie producers.</p>

<p>Previously announced participants for the 2010 SXSW Film Conference include
Jeffery Tambor’s Acting Workshop, a <em>Kick-Ass</em> Conversation panel with
director Matthew Vaughn, actors Aaron Johnson, Cholë Grace Moretz and
Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and comic writers Mark Millar and John S. Romita,
Academy Award-winning Argentine composer, solo artist and producer Gustavo

potential clients, thus giving up her last chance to have a child of her own.</p>

Rhodes and the Texas Twisters performing at Eli’s Mile High Club in Oakland,
California.</p>

<p><em>The Devil’s Swing</em> (2005) The film takes its name from a story people tell in
the isolated region of the Texas-Mexico border and reveals the seemingly
unrelated worlds of sacred rituals, corridos, drug lords, Pancho Villa and the
tragic killing of a nineteen year old boy.</p>

<p><em>The Hard Ride</em> (1996) A journey into the little known world of the black
ranch rodeo culture of Southeast Texas.</p>

<p><em>Little Willie Eason and His Talking Gospel Guitar</em> (2005) Taking place on the
street and in the House of God Church south of Miami, the film highlights the
man who introduced the pedal steel guitar as an instrument for the expression
of faith.</p>

<p><em>The Microtones of Simon Shaheen</em> (2010) The film introduces a virtuoso of the
Arabic oud and violin, and his Palestinian community in Brooklyn.</p>

<p><em>The Poetry of Exactitude</em> (2008) The film delves into the imagination of
Lucien Mouchet and the 1/120th scale carousels and fairground scenes that he
has been making in Paris, France since 1946.</p>

<p>_Stoney Knows How _(1981) Govenar’s first film, is an inside look at the
circus and carnival sideshow from the point of view of Old School tattoo
master, Leonard St. Clair, disabled by arthritis at the age of four, who
