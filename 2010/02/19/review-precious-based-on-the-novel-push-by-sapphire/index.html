<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/02/monique_precious.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/02/monique_precious.jpg" alt="Mo'Nique in Precious" /></a>Lee Daniels’ <em>Precious: Based on
the Novel “Push” by Sapphire</em> is difficult to talk about, let alone sit
through. Part memoir, part fantasy and part social deconstruction, the film
deals in a grab bag of hot button social mores: poverty, racism, rape, incest,
epidemics and education reform to name only a few. The director is literally
playing with fire, yet, somehow, he has managed to make a feel-good movie. You
heard me right.</p>

<p>Clarice Precious Jones lives in Harlem with her abusive mother. The year is
1987 and she is pregnant with her second child by her father. At 16, Precious
is still in junior high school, until her pro-active principal recommends her
for an alternative schooling program called Each One Teach One. It is here,
with the help of a self-assured teacher and a hood-bred cadre of girls, that
her journey of self-discovery begins. What does she discover? The same thing
we know about ten minutes into the film: that her mother is a big ol’ B-word.</p>

<p>Mo’Nique’s performance has been lauded since the film’s premiere at the 2009
Sundance Film Festival, but the comedian has gained ever more traction as
awards season has ramped up. As Mary, the welfare leeching tormentor of the
title character, she has given us a phenomenal peek at the other side of the
line that separates good from evil. The worst villains are the ones whose
motivations are easily understood. What is so damning about this portrait is
that the further you get pulled into siding with Mary, the worse it makes you
feel as a human.</p>

<p>Why go with a comedian, especially one as boisterous and unruly as Mo’nique,
for this role? If I may indulge my darker side for a moment, I believe it is
because the role is actually funny. Her endless rants, her unapologetic abuse
of the welfare system, her physical dominance over her daughter all require a
comedic agility that a classically trained dramatist may not have been able to
pull off. She is not just a monster, she is a devolved woman. The world in
which she lives has literally flipped her inside out. Up may as well be down
for her; she is a comedic villain. Precious must find a way to navigate the
same streets that undid her mother without going down the same path.</p>

<p>For all the deserved praise sent Mo’Nique’s way, the real person we have to
thank is Lee Daniels for seeing the people he needed in each role and bringing
their best out on screen. No one could have played Mary like Mo’Nique, but it
takes a real talent to pull that out of her. The same rings true when it comes
to Gabourey Sidibe as Precious. Similar to a hottie in a horror film, Ms.
Sidibe gave herself over to Mr. Daniels, letting him literally throw just
about everything at her. It isn’t until the end of the film, when the roots of
a lesson have taken hold in her, that the actress is asked to do too much
emoting. Instead, the world around Precious keeps colliding with her. The
deadpan that she retains through all of it is phenomenal. The film would fall
apart completely without it.</p>

<p>Technically, the film suffers from overuse of slow motion effects. As I have
mentioned, the film dips into uncomfortable comedy at points. The truth is
that you can’t have a comedy that is this heavy, so it seems someone, I’d like
to think a studio head, has brought the slow motion effects in to temper the
more raucous moments of the film. For example, when Mary tosses a piece of
chicken at Precious early in the film, the point is made that this is an
abusive home. However, we flip on the slow-mo and a dramatic refrain to point
out that this is important, that this is scary. Without it we might be found
laughing.</p>

<p>I don’t want to spoil anything for you, but Precious contains a masterfully
executed sequence. Invoking Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>, Precious ascends the stairs
to her apartment holding her newborn son. We know that her mother is a ticking
time bomb and that a girl of her stature will have a tough time going up so
many flights. Not missing an opportunity, Mr. Daniels with editor Joe Klotz
drag out the sequence, ensuring racing hearts the whole way through. By the
time she finally opens the door to the apartment, your blood will be at a boil
just waiting for Mary to go off. It is phenomenal.</p>

<p>The real trouble with <em>Precious</em> is that the payoff isn’t necessarily worth
the emotional roller coaster the film puts you through. Sure, by the end you
will probably feel uplifted as our hero walks away with her head held high
(spoiler?), but is it all worth it? Has Precious avoided a bleak future? While
you may be inspired, you will probably come crashing back down to reality and
wonder, for some time, whether or not you actually like the film. Overall, I
can’t quite tell if this is a great film or not. It certainly has a lot going
for it, but it feels more like a first film (it is Mr. Daniels’ second as
director) than a masterpiece. Hopefully, we will see many exciting things from
Lee Daniels in the future.</p>
