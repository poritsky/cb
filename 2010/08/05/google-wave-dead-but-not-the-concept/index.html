<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/google_film_wave_dead_logo.png"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/google_film_wave_dead_logo-
300x262.png" alt="Google Wave Film Logo 2009-2010" /></a>Exactly 14 months ago,
shortly after its introduction, I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-
wave-for-filmmakers-a-concept/">outlined a concept for how Google Wave
could be used by filmmakers</a> (which I recommend reading before you go on).
The post was widely read, and even <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/surfs-up-wednesday-google-wave-
update.html">Google featured the
idea</a> as a potential use case scenario for its fledgling product. After
snagging a (relatively) early beta spot for the service, I witnessed how
filmmakers were attempting to make use of it. I should emphasize the word
attempting, because most users were completely lost on how to implement the
technology. Yesterday, Google announced it will stop developing the platform,
and has only promised to support their version of Wave through the end of
2010. Google Wave is dead. So is the Google Wave for filmmakers concept dead?</p>

<p><strong>Why Wave Died</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/Wave_Screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/Wave_Screenshot.jpg" alt="Google Wave Screenshot" /></a>Tech pundits will break this story
down from every direction, but I can offer a few armchair talking points on
the subject of Wave’s demise. The first and most important is that Google Wave
requires a new workflow but looks and feels like so many other, older
workflows. It feels like a document but looks like e-mail, and functions like
neither. It has all the downsides of chat, commenting and bulletin board
engines with none of the benefits of modern browsing and design. Basically,
when greeted with either a blank or a populated wave, every user approaches
adding to it differently, which leads not only to confusion, but clunky
performance. Worse still, nearly every basic use case for Google Wave is
superseded by a number of other web services.</p>

<p>But it’s not all bad. There is a reason why, when Google introduced Wave at
their I/O Conference in 2009, the web community at large became overwhelmed
with excitement, and it’s not just because of the company’s impressive track
record. Its promise was to bring e-mail into the 21st century by redesigning
it from the ground up. This promise became something of an albatross almost
immediately; it’s the reason so many people were confused when they opened up
a wave. Still, it’s the best effort there has been yet to organize the clunky,
unwieldy nature of message, reply, forward, and so on. Google has developed
some amazing technologies in Wave that will most likely end up elsewhere, such
as the ability to view live text edits from multiple collaborators. For a
company that thrives on innovation, Wave is nothing but a win for Google.</p>

<p>In the end, and it <em>is</em> the end, no one could find a killer use for the
product. The filmmakers whose waves I’ve participated in usually just let the
thing turn into a comment forum, basically a glorified blog post. Some have
tried to collaborate on screenplays, but Wave is not ready for documents that
long. Furthermore, even though Wave cleverly tracks changes, it <em>feels</em> like
destructive editing, and that’s a big deal to users. If you think you can’t
get a change back, you won’t make a change.</p>

<p><strong>Why “Wave” for Filmmakers isn’t Dead</strong><br />
Wave’s possibilities turned out to be far more interesting than its actual
uses. The key to the software was text manipulation and tracking among a
number of users. You could edit text collaboratively, and then embed that
information on a website. You could also bring various strands of data
(photos, videos) into a wave. The concept of one central, editable document is
what opened up the Google Wave for Filmmakers concept for me. That central
document, in my example an XML document, is the key to the idea. The hope,
originally, was that Google Wave would flourish and grow, allowing for the
kinds of hooks I mentioned. It hasn’t, and it won’t.</p>

<p>Centralizing film editing is not a new idea. Apple and Avid and other third
party hardware makers offer a number of solutions for getting multiple
editors, producers, writers and other creatives on the same page. However,
today, these technologies are extremely limited, usually requiring involved
parties to be in the same building. From a creative standpoint, this is an
idea that has worked for nearly a hundred years, since the advent of the
vertically integrated studio. Clearly, filmmakers demand a new level of
mobility and collaboration today. Why be tied to a single location? Why be
tied to a finite team even? Why not have people perform simple tasks in your
process to move things forward?</p>

<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong><br />
Technologically, we are at least a decade away from bringing all the strands
of moviemaking together in an intuitive manner. Video is one of the last
strongholds of supercomputing since it requires incredibly robust hardware.
For most consumer uses, desktop all-in-ones and laptop computers suffice for
nearly any task, including video editing. It wasn’t always that way. Ten years
ago, working with video on a laptop was something of a novelty, today it’s
become quite common, though not for processor heavy tasks like transcoding or
compositing. Computers are getting smaller and faster, and many basic tasks
have all but obliterated the need for hardware altogether. Look at word
processing, e-mail, basic photo editing, playlist creation, and even document
storage as just a few examples of cloud ubiquity where once hardware reigned.
It is not a matter of whether video editing will make it to the cloud, but
when.</p>

<p>For now, creators will keep on creating. Like anything else, these are just
tools. Google Wave was a bold move in the right direction towards central
collaboration. There is no way to look at this as a failure for Google, or for
any of us. The conversation has shifted. Now we need to take the momentum that
Google Wave kicked off and the tools it will leave behind to keep the
conversation up so that when the technology falls in line, we will be there to
adopt filmmaking methodologies that move us forward.</p>
