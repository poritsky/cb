<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/twelve3.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/twelve3-300x199.jpg" alt="Twelve Still" /></a>If a mashup of <em>Gossip Girl</em>, <em>Crash</em> and
<em>Traffic</em> doesn’t sound appealing to you, then you should probably skip Joel
Schumacher’s disastrous <em>Twelve</em>. If that does sound right up your alley, then
you’re beyond help so do whatever you want. In what appears to have been
thrown together over a few weekends (it was actually shot in 23 days), the
film follows White Mike (Chace Crawford) a straight-edge drug dealer who
tailors to the Upper East Side’s teenage addicted denizens, over a fateful
three day period in which everything changes for everyone, or some such
nonsense. It’s a mess.</p>

<p>Now about White Mike. His restauranteur father has fallen on hard times, so he
dropped out of school and took on the task of dealing dope. The kids love him
since he is, or was, one of them. Anyway, his cousin gets high one night on a
new designer drug called Twelve, presumably because it’s a mixture of that
many psychotropics, and goes off to Harlem wielding a gun in hopes of scoring
more of the stuff. His plan doesn’t go off exactly as planned, which sorta
kinda sets events in motion so that White Mike learns something about himself.</p>

<p>The first question I get when I describe the plot of this film to friends is
“Who cares about rich white kids anyway?” I don’t see why we shouldn’t, but
this film doesn’t seem to understand the species at all. For example, in one
scene a fame-mongering girl dreams big, coercing a venue for her birthday
party by predicting the kind of party “Page Six” would notice. Not to diminish
the infamy of that gossip column, but has anyone involved with this film met a
teenager? Are they aware of blogs? This is one of many little problems that
make these kids not just vacuous, but wholly unrealistic.</p>

<p>What has always confounded me about Paul Haggis’s <em>Crash</em> (and its copycats,
for that matter) is that it tries to pawn off stilted intertwining plot lines
as something of actual substance. At least in the case of that film, each
strand was at least interesting. In <em>Twelve</em>, of the plot lines that I could
keep track of, only one showed any promise as an interesting narrative and it
goes forgotten and unresolved halfway through the film. That is the story of
Hunter, played by Philip Ettinger, a rich kid who heads to Harlem to play
basketball to let out his demons every so often. He is accused of a crime he
didn’t commit, too afraid to call his parents for help and too stupid to call
a lawyer. The setup for his story is pulpy enough that I’d love to see it
expanded into a whole film, perhaps a teenage remake of Fritz Lang’s <em>Fury</em>.
Unfortunately, once Hunter is no longer useful to advancing White Mike’s
limited storyline he is forgotten about.</p>

<p>There are a number of good performances from the young cast. Mr. Crawford does
a serviceable job in the lead role, but there’s so little to his character
that it’s hard to blame him for a mostly one-note outing. Emily Meade, as
Jessica, straddles the line of spoiled rich bitch and brainy valedictorian-
cum-drug addict. She is given one of the best reveals of the film, one in
which she offers her innocence in exchange fora hit of Twelve. Unfortunately,
Schumacher botches the whole moment by offering up a cheap joke that botches
the impact of the whole thing. Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is fine, but his role,
Lionel the drug dealer, changes motivation from scene to scene too much for
him to get an emotional handle on it. Kieran Culkin is best when not sulking,
which is unfortunate given his role as Chris, the chronically screwed
straight-arrow whose parent free house is host to the much debauchery.</p>

<p>There are many others in the film, but all the performances suffer from the
same problem: poor direction. It is obvious that this film was made quickly,
too quickly to allow any of them to fully develop a character. There are
moments where it feels like you are watching dailies instead of a finished
piece. There just isn’t enough coverage of good takes to pull this thing
together. It is Mr. Schumacher’s job to know his limits or push his actors to
fit the accelerated schedule. He didn’t succeed at either.</p>

<p>Finally, I have to mention the awful narration. Kieffer Sutherland reads what
I can only assume is the entirety of the novel by Nick McDonnell that the film
is based on sans dialogue. It is a whole not of narration, and there is no
justifiable reason for it except that this story is so thin they needed
something to get to feature length. Part of the reason the film is hardly
memorable is because narration will never take the place of well-developed
storytelling. Though the rules of cinema are not finite, “Show, don’t tell” is
a pretty big one. Sidestepping this completely, Sutherland’s narration is so
present, so constant, that it almost feels as though you are watching an
audiobook. A boring, unresolved and barely entertaining audiobook.</p>
