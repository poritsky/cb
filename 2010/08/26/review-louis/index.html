/louisstill-300x184.jpg" alt="Louis Still" /></a>It almost seems unfair, at this point,
to post a review of Dan Pritzker’s silent film <em>Louis</em>. It’s not that I
haven’t seen the the film, I have, but I’m not positive that I’ve actually
heard it. Featuring a flowing musical score penned by Jazz’s presiding dean,
Wynton Marsalis, the film will be on tour through the last week of August with
live accompaniment by Marsalis, pianist Cecile Licad and a ten-piece ensemble.
If the phrase “concert film” has been claimed by documentarians, then the only
other term I could think of for <em>Louis</em> is “event film”. Recounting a reverie
of the early life of trumpet great Louis Armstrong, the film’s five live
showings will be nothing short of a grand event.</p>

<p>Pritzker and writers Derick Martini, Steve Martini and David Rothschild came
up with a gimmick film, a riff on a bygone era of cinema and music; the birth,
as it were, of both. We are brought into early 20th century New Orleans, a
town with a hopping brothel, and evil magistrate, and streets teeming with
competing horn blowers. The tale follows our young protagonist, Louis (Anthony
Coleman), as he gets mixed up in the affairs of Grace (Shanti Lowry), a woman
of the night looking to protect her newborn from the horrors of the world she
has endured. Judge Perry (Jackie Earle Haley) rules the town by force, and
once he learns he is the father of Grace’s baby, he sicks his goon Pat
McMurphy (Michael Rooker) on her in hopes of shutting her up. That is, not if
Louis has anything to say about it.</p>

<p>Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, perhaps most well known for his work with a
young Steven Spielberg and an old Woody Allen, clearly approached the film
looking to exhume a vaudevillian style, a time when actors caked their faces
with makeup just so that their expressions might be seen in the cheap seats.
As cinema grew technologically, this tradition fell away, allowing
photographers to get in and capture an actor’s essence au natural. It seems
that Zsigmond is out to prove something on his own, using exaggerated, “caked
on”, cinematography. He celebrates the artifice of silent cinema: the sterile
sound stages, the comic fast motion, the tinted, washed out look. The trouble
is that artifice can only go so far, coming off as a one-joke parody rather
than an exploration of the way things were.</p>

<p>Part way through the film, when our heroine heads into her brothel, the camera
slides past a porch, through another entrance, up a stairwell and around the
den of iniquity, in a series of long takes. Never mind that this would have
been impossible to do in the silent cinema days, both for the weight of the
camera and the shortness of the reels; I couldn’t help but question whether or
not this shot has any place in this film regardless of time. It’s impressive,
like most long takes, only for its ambition. In execution, it adds little than
if we got snips and snaps of the building through montage. On top of that, we
witness a room full of half clothed harlots and their Johns, each couple more
racy than the next. The women exude a sense of 21st century pornographic
beauty, a far cry from period specific hookers. That, however, is the point.</p>

<p>One cannot think of <em>Louis</em> as a film with musical accompaniment, but a
concert with an adjoining film. Marsalis’s scores are predictable and
derivative, but that doesn’t mean they don’t serve an important narrative
purpose. This is clearly an emotional history of Jazz, focusing on it’s faster
progenitor, Dixieland. And that’s really the point. If we look at music in the
20th century, right up to our most recent aural movements, much of it stems
from the original “Devil’s Music”, Jazz. In that sense, Pritzker really earned
his R rating here, giving Jazz a bit of sex, a bit of naughtiness. Too quickly
we think of the musical genre as relegated to easy listeners and junior high
school students, too often we mistake it for a dead language. Pritzker and
Marsalis are here to say Jazz is not only alive but still capable of shocking
us, of pushing us to our darker, some would say more interesting, mind space.
In that sense, <em>Louis</em>, as far as I’ve heard it, is a rousing success. But to
watch it without music, is to watch very little.</p>

<p>Louis will be at the Apollo Theater in New York City on Monday, August 30th.
It is currently touring the U.S. through August 31st. For more details, <a href="http://www.louisthemovie.com/">visit
