<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/net-neutral.png"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/net-neutral-300x262.png" alt="Net Neutrality for Filmmakers" /></a>On Monday, Google and Verizon
issued a joint proposal on the issue of network neutrality, or net neutrality.
In it, the companies map out how they feel on the subject and issue a list of
rules they believe should be adopted industry-wide. So what is this all about
and why should filmmakers care? Give me a few paragraphs.</p>

<p><strong>Brief Briefing</strong><br />
First, a definition from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">extensive Wikipedia
article</a>: “At its simplest
network neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be
treated equally.” You can read the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/35599242/Verizon-Google-Legislative-
Framework-Proposal">two-page
proposal</a>. If the lawyer-speak gets you down, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/09/google-and-verizons-
net-neutrality-proposal-explained/">Engadget’s Nilay
Patel offers a clear</a> breakdown of every point, while <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/theres-only-one-internet">John
Bergmayer at Public Knowledge gives some great
perspective</a> on
the implications of the document. If that’s not enough, you can read the joint
post on <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-and-
verizon-op-ed-path-to-open.html">Google’s</a> and <a href="http://policyblog.verizon.com
/BlogPost/742/JointPolicyProposalforanOpenInternet.aspx">Verizon’s</a> public policy blogs.
The two companies also co-authored an op-ed in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080905647.html">Tuesday’s Washington
Post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bits of Bits</strong><br />
There are two parts of Google and Verizon’s proposal that should worry
filmmakers and audience members alike. The first one is their provision for
“Additional Online Services”. There is no clear cut definition for what these
additional services could be, but when asked on a conference call, Verizon’s
CEO <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/08/09/google-and-
verizon-agree-to-net-neutrality-compromise/">Ivan Seidenberg used 3D content</a> as an example. If 3D content is
considered an additional service, then why not video?</p>

<p>Broadband high-speed Internet connections have become the norm in the last
decade, and the film industry has flourished because of it. Sites like iTunes,
Netflix, Amazon Video and YouTube offer filmmakers, both mainstream and
independent, more options for reaching out to audiences than ever before.
Thanks to the availability of high speed broadband connections, we can deliver
high quality video near-instantaneously. Also, as <a href="http://daily.greencine.com/archives/007875.html">Greencine Daily’s Vadim
Rizov pointed out recently</a>,
digitally equipped theaters represent about 15% of all movie screens
worldwide. Digital films are projected from a series of files, sent out over a
secure high-speed connection. Even productions make extensive use of
broadband, allowing for editors to be in one base location where footage can
be uploaded to them on a daily basis. In other words, the film industry relies
on incredible amounts of bandwidth.</p>

<p>But bits are bits and bytes are bytes, correct? This mention of additional
services suggests otherwise. The, proposal keeps things unclear (the whole
definition of these services is 106 words) but mentions “traffic
prioritization” as one use case, meaning some data will get to make use of
more badwidth while other data will not.  The fear in this case is that
Verizon, or any ISP for that matter, could offer lucrative prioritization
contracts to some movie companies, ones not viewed as competitors, while
leaving others out. Let’s say they strike a deal with AMC Theaters but not
Landmark, then Landmark would of course have to go with another ISP. But these
exclusivity deals would only go so far before either bandwidth runs out or
partnerships dry up, meaning the little guys won’t be able to compete anymore.</p>

<p>What happens when theatrical video file sizes become smaller and video codecs
become more robust? One day, perhaps, video streaming won’t require as much
bandwidth, but these services could already be in place. So those theaters who
are still around would still be paying for legacy technology for no reason.
Another example is video editing. Until Apple introduced its “ProRes 422
(Proxy)” codec, their larger “ProRes 422” was the smallest editable HD codec.
If a post-production companies leases bandwidth in order to move “ProRes 422”
because it is considered an additional service, will it be stuck with the same
agreement once it switches to “ProRes 422 (Proxy)” even though the files would
be small enough to use their standard broadband connection? Google and Verizon
have no answer to these questions.</p>

<p><strong>No Strings</strong><br />
The second, and more worrisome issue of the proposal is how the corporations
refer to wireless broadband technologies. They make a clear distinction
between wired and wireless, not based on connectivity but based on content and
services. While most of the proposal ensures an open Internet over a wired
connection, it makes no such provision for wireless technologies, citing its
“still-developing nature”. According to this plan, there become two Internets:
the wired and the wireless. Uh, what?</p>

<p>In my original <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-wave-for-
filmmakers-a-concept/">Google Wave for
Filmmakers</a> concept, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/08/05/google-wave-dead-but-not-the-
concept/">which I recently
revised</a> after Wave’s demise, I mentioned the possibility of cameras that
could upload footage straight to the web for editing by a remote team. Today’s
wireless systems, like those that provide Internet connections for iPhones and
Blackberrys, are not fast enough to handle the load of uncompressed video. One
day they will be, and when that day comes we will have professional-grade
video cameras with high-speed data connections. That way, you can shoot and
send your footage right to your editors, from anywhere in the world. Or will
that ability be hampered by Google and Verizon’s implication that wireless
data is somehow different from wired data?</p>

<p>On the distribution end of things, today’s most advanced smartphones can play
HD video on their high resolution screens, but there is still no way to get
that data to them over their wireless connections. HD streaming is usually
limited to WiFi connections, and downloads cap out at 10 or 20 megabytes
depending on your provider. These bottlenecks are purportedly in place to keep
the network active because it can’t handle the data load. An ulterior motive
could be that wireless providers, like Verizon and AT&amp;T, could strike
exclusivity deals with different content partners and share revenue from the
sales. In this case, Disney could sell it’s HD content wirelessly only to
Verizon customers. Independent filmmakers who don’t have the marketing power
to set up such contracts would be left out of wireless distribution
completely.</p>

<p><strong>Action!</strong><br />
This may all seem academic today, when digital projection is slowly getting
off to a start and highly compressed (read: crappy) mobile video is the norm.
In the next two decades, wireless broadband will probably supplant wired
broadband for most of our network solutions. Just look at how far mobile
computing has come in the last five years. Imagine what the landscape will be
like in one hundred years. Will we have set events in motion that limit
innovation and set back independent film distribution?</p>

<p>As an online publisher, a cinephile and someone who works in the film
industry, I am deeply disturbed by Google and Verizon’s proposal. I cannot
support it and I encourage you to learn about what’s at stake. The digital
revolution has invigorated the independent film movement, bringing films to
light that otherwise could not be funded/distributed. By giving up on the most
basic concept of the networked world, that there is one Internet, we are also
giving up on a bright future for cinema. <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/alertfax/3299">Public Knowledge has drafted a

take action, and voice your opinion.</p>
