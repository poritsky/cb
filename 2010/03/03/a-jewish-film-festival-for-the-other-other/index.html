<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/JeremyHabash.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

<p>How can I explain what the <a href="http://www.sephardicfilmfest.org/films.html">New York Sephardic Jewish
Film</a> Festival is? It’s very name
is so local and yet its scope is entirely global. I suppose I could start by
explaining what is meant by “Sephardic.” Allow me to generalize. Here in New
York City it is pretty common to boil Jews down to one of two stereotypes: the
Orthodox and the nebbish. These are Ashkenazi Jews who, thanks to a sordid
history of European emigration, took root here en masse around the turn of the
20th century. Ashkenazim are basically the shtetl Jews; the <em>Fiddler on the
Roof</em> Jews.</p>

<p>That film is perhaps the ultimate Hollywood pontification on the Jew, an image
of a people that is, for better or worse, an accepted truth. Sephardic Jewry,
who hail from Spain, Northern Africa and the Fertile Crescent (among other
places), have almost no image in American cinema. In fact, in America, little
is known of this “other” kind of Jew outside the confines of the Jewish
community. Sephardim observe different dietary laws (sometimes), speak a
different dialect of Hebrew, observe different customs and have a rich history
of art and literature that is speckled with influence from the various
cultures in which they have existed. How fitting it is then, that there should
be a New York Sephardic Jewish Film Festival, to both celebrate and educate us
on these Jews who perhaps don’t fit the mold of the mainstream. A festival for
the other other.</p>

<p>But what about the films? I was only able to see three films from the fest. I
would like to tell you about two and the third I will review before it’s
snow=postponed screening. The first film I watched was a documentary called
<em>Salvador</em> by Nissim Mossek. Stylistically, the film is very weak, which is to
say there isn’t much style at all. It is a procedural accounting of a
shipwreck that occurred 70 years ago. <em>Salvador</em> achieves its goal of relating
the facts to you with interviews, photographs and found footage. Through all
of it, a small group of “Salvador” survivors meet and journey, for the first
time in over a half century, back to their homeland of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The tale itself is full of intrigue and adventure. As the Nazis gained power
in Bulgaria, it became increasingly difficult for Jews to leave the country.
Enter Dr. Confino, an accidental one-man Zionist enterprise. After receiving
little help from the Zionist movement, whose resources were stretched thin, he
took matters into his own hands to purchase ships and organize clandestine
voyages to Palestine, where the Jewish homeland was being built. After many
successful journeys, things get a bit hazy depending on how you look at the
facts. Confino replaced his best ship, which had trafficked many a Bulgarian
Jew, for the “Salvador”, a vessel considered shoddy at best. Intended to take
around 100 Zionist youths across the sea, the manifest more than tripled
before it left for Palestine, creating a recipe for disaster, which occurred
off the coast of Turkey.</p>

<p>About 5 kilometers south of the Turkish fishing town of Silivri, the boat
capsized and the struggle for shore began. 238 of the 352 people on board
drowned. So harrowing was the event that to this day, local fisherman refer to
the waters where the ship went down as “the sea of the Jews.” What’s so
amazing is that this is only where the adventure begins. Remember, these Jews
who were fleeing from the Nazis now find themselves shipwrecked in Turkey.
Many did make it to the Jewish homeland eventually, and the film clearly tells
their tale. Early on, one of the survivors proclaims that no one cared about
the story back then, and that this film is the first to take on the subject of
the Salvador. It’s true; in 1940 a shipwreck in Turkey is but a footnote to
the ground-shaking news that came out every day. The story of the Salvador is
so riveting it sounds like it would make a great movie. Whether that movie
should necessarily be a documentary or not, I’ll leave up to you to decide.</p>

<p>The second film was another documentary called <em>Children of the Bible</em>, by
Nitza Gonen. This time we have a vivid portrait of rapper Jeremy Cool Habash,
an Ethiopian émigré whose mission is to teach young Ethiopian Israelis about
their heritage. The history of Ethiopian Jewry and their introduction to
Israeli society could fill volumes, but this film tries to focus in on one
man’s mission to teach through music. The short of it is that many Ethiopians
feel displaced in Israeli society where some question their Jewish roots.
Branded as outsiders, many youths turn to American “gangster” culture; to
drugs and violence.</p>

<p>Enter Mr. Habash, who raps in Hebrew and Amharic. He believes that young
Ethiopians should celebrate their heritage rather than try to fit into the
culture that surrounds them. He teaches kids the meanings of their Amharic
names and tells them many stories about what life was like for him in
Ethiopia. The film has many moving moments, like watching the kids perform a
rap they wrote about how they want to grow up, or seeing Jeremy return to
Africa where he acts like a stubborn child to a family not his own. There is
footage of a rally to give equal religious authority to the Ethiopian rabbis,
called the Kesses. <em>Children of the Bible</em> serves as a really interesting
introduction to Ethiopian Jewry for anyone interested.</p>

<p>So there you have it: films for the other other. Perhaps <em>Children of the
Bible</em> could be considered a film for the other other other. Unfortunately I
wasn’t able to see any other films, so I can’t speak for the rest of the
festival. Some screenings have been recheduled due to snow, so check out their
website to see what is still coming.</p>
