<p>The statues are all distributed, the corks are all popped, and now it is time
to talk about the 82nd Academy Awards in the past tense. We’ll get to who won,
but first off I’d like to talk about who lost: the viewing audience. This has
to be one of the worst awards broadcasts in recent memory. Overlong and
underwhelming, the only thing interesting in the show was actually finding out
who won, which is weird because that often takes a backseat to the rest of the
spectacle.</p>

<p>Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin were charming, albeit neutered, hosts. They
farmed the opening number out to Neil Patrick Harris, which was predictably
fine, but it seemed like a complete redux of his bouts as Tony and Emmy host.
On paper it sounds poignant, but in practice it felt stale. I long for the
days when Billy Crystal would superimpose himself into the top nominated
films. I can understand the new hosts wanting to move forward with an original
spin, only this felt like a step backwards.</p>

<p>I’m not going to dissect the interpretive dance number, or “Oscars 2: Electric
Boogaloo,” as I like to call it.</p>

<p>I always tune in for the interstitial montages. There were really only two
this year besides the traditional “In Memoriam.” The first was a John Hughes
tribute, which was accompanied by a flock of the kids he made icons gathered
on stage. The montage itself was probably the best part of the evening,
capturing the essence of Mr. Hughes’ momentous career. It didn’t, however, dig
any deeper than that, which is a shame. Back when Errol Morris was making
these things there was a sense of storytelling to the montages. Even further
back, Chuck Workman used to raise these clip-ups to another artistic level
completely. Ah, the good ol’ days. The other big montage was a celebration of
horror films. This was not nearly as successful as the John Hughes piece.
Whoever made it relied far to heavily on clips from <em>The Shining</em> to get them
out of creative ruts. Nonetheless, it was a fairly decent primer on horror
films, but I’m sure fanboys and fangirls out there will protest.</p>

<p>It turns out spending time showing us all ten Best Picture nominees wasn’t all
that much of a time-suck. The real gouge-your-eyes out moment came later in
the night, when the awards for Best Actor and Actress were given out. Each
nominee was treated to a celebrity pal toasting their careers and
performances. Considering actors, and really all nominees, are supposedly
being graded on a specific performance and not the breadth of their careers,
the mini-retrospective monologues came off more obnoxious than celebratory.
And let’s face it, four of the nominees are going to lose, so let’s move
things along and get to the meat.</p>

<p>As for that meat: it’s a strange world where Sandra Bullock wins an Oscar for
a mediocre performance in an even more mediocre film. All I can imagine is
that the rest of the actresses up for the honor split the vote so severely
that the safest bet, the middle of the road one, got the most votes. Mo’Nique
was completely deserving of the Best Supporting Actress honor. Her speech
featured a nice shout out to Hattie McDaniel, and this time it made a lot more
sense than when George Clooney invoked the actresses name in 2006. Jeff
Bridges looked like the happiest kid in the room, and Christoph Waltz still
scares me after <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>.</p>

<p>While some were a bit put off by Sandy Powell’s acceptance speech when she won
for Best Costume Design for <em>The Young Victoria</em>, I thought it was one of the
most refreshing moments of the evening. She praised the costume designers who
make non-period pieces, essentially imploring the Academy to vote in their
favor more often. This has long been a sticking point of mine: the more frill
and lace a film has the better chance it has of winning costume design. Modern
pieces require a careful hand as well, so she’s right; the Academy should
rethink who they give this award to.</p>

<p>I had Quentin Tarantino pegged for Best Original Screenplay, mostly because I
think <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> lives up to the award’s title so well. Mark Boal
brought us <em>The Hurt Locker</em> so the award is certainly well-deserved, however
I have a feeling it will be the kiss of death for him. I wouldn’t hold my
breath waiting for the next mind-blowing Boal penned script. <em>Precious: Based
on the Novel “Push” by Sapphire</em> is certainly an innovative adaptation, plus
its written lineage is right there it it’s ridiculously long title. Congrats
to Geoffrey Fletcher, on that note.</p>

<p>I’m skipping a lot, I know. They’re threatening to play me off…</p>

<p>Finally, we now live in a world where a woman has won an Oscar for Best
Director. Fourth time’s a charm. This truly was a momentous occasion. Ms.
Bigelow did a phenomenal job with a very difficult film. Unlike a
multi-(hundred)-million dollar spectacle like <em>Avatar</em> or a coming of middle-
age piece like <em>Up in the Air</em>, <em>The Hurt Locker</em> is a loose cannon. It could
have gone horribly wrong in another’s hands. There is very little story to the
film, no relatable antagonists, and the driving theme of modern masculinity
trickles out instead of bombarding the audience. The only thing that could
wrangle such an unstable project is the steady hand of a powerful director. It
is a cinematic achievement and deserving of all the honors it racked up last
night. Congratulations to all.</p>

<p>So there you have it: perhaps the worst Oscars in over a decade. They went for
glitzy but they landed on chintzy. It was long, it was boring, but dammit,
I’ll be back next year to tune in for another show, hoping against hope that
the broadcast will return to its former glory.</p>
