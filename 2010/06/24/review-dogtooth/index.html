<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/dogtooth.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06
/dogtooth-300x198.jpg" alt="Dogtooth Still" /></a>One of the greatest aesthetic strengths
of <em>Dogtooth’_s execution is perhaps its implicit nature, one that
intentionally confuses and overwhelms to illustrate the horrific outcomes of a
concerned parental nature. Director Giorgos Lanthimos gives little exposition
to grasp, expecting an attentive audience to catch the complex designs of the
world created by the Greek parents of secluded children, but also to ignite an
empathetic confusion that these children would experience if allowed to view
the world beyond their parent’s design. The film’s approach towards audience
engagement is unconventional, yet brilliantly metaphoric (hence it’s _Un
Certain Regard</em> award), yet <em>Dogtooth</em> is also quite traditional in its
coming-of-age themes and agenda, all appropriate combinations for a world
cinema classic.</p>

<p>The film starts with some initially innocent moments, in which three siblings
listen to a homemade instructional audio tape that illustrates definitions for
words, but adventurous words like “sea” and “excursion” are given other
meanings, “sea” is a word that describes a leather chair, while “excursion” is
a “resistant material used to construct floors.” The children are
simultaneously introduced, as they listen to these definitions, confused and
distracted by other ideas that seem to form revolving about competitive games
of endurance (the youngest sibling suggests a game in which they all place
their hands beneath hot water to see whom can remain the longest).</p>

<p>While this moment that introduces parent-imposed rules, and the children
resolution of mis-direction, is surreal it is where our attention is focused
that suggests the real misfortune. Instead of giving attention to performance,
or character, the audience is immediately struggling to comprehend the meaning
behind these false connections. This initial audience-subject (non)interaction
suggests a larger inhumanity beyond simply re-designed definitions and the
games, we are made to ignore the real emotions of fear and painful confusion
to focus on semantics and structural codes. These thought processes mirror the
initial reactions to any real-world situations of a similar nature, and our
identification with these emotional problems comes too late for any safe
resolutions.</p>

<p>While these false-definitions and games suggest a specific critical analysis
of Greece’s educational system, it also begins a larger analysis of the
international fear of external forces overtaking traditional/domestic values.
The father of this family is declared as the only one able to safely leave the
house grounds, and fears are instilled of any other external interactions. In
one instance a cat, found in their yard, is fearfully and violently attacked.
This shocking moment reinforces the point of unnecessary cruelty and further
argues against false tales that border on the propagandistic. These fears and
anxieties are not just Greek, but can be found as part of any country’s
international stance on “terrorism,” or even against another country’s
oppositional political agenda. The threat against any one country’s
homogenized ideas is ultimately not that of external forces, but those
oppressed within these arbitrary confines.</p>

<p>What further reinforces the allegory of political structures of fear and
power, the parents are powerful enough to instill hopes and dreams of
connection with the impossible: every time a plane flies overhead, the
children express their desires to catch it when it falls. This impossible
dream reinforces parental control, as they know these children will never be
able to achieve this dream and there is no danger of their desires leaving the
safety of their control. To appease them, the mother tosses a small toy plane
into the back yard, as the children race excitedly to connect with the one
approved interaction with the world beyond their own. But, the mother can only
quench these desires for so long, as dreams tend to expand into greater and
more emotionally complex needs. The hope and strength of these dreams find
their way into the head of the eldest daughter, who finds ways to subvert
these house rules to expand her continued desire to know more. Her attempts
turn heroic, as she continually surprises in her ingenuity to finds ways to
interact with outside world. The moment of true audience comfort and
identification comes when she gains access to smuggled VHS tapes of Avildsen’s
<em>Rocky</em> and Spielberg’s <em>Jaws</em>, which not only open up positive emotions of
humor and inspiration, but also a multitude of Pandoric doors that lead to
both hope and suppression.</p>

<p>Instead of a healthy relationship between family members and appropriate
development into adulthood, these imposed restraints begin to breed
illiteracy, unemployable life skills, unrealistic dreams, jealousy and
animosity. When the father chastises a young woman for introducing his
daughter to <em>Rocky</em> and <em>Jaws</em>, he reacts violently upon her and curses her “I
hope your kids have bad influences and develop a bad personality.” This is
perhaps a direct attack not only on American culture, but upon the
hypocritical stance taken by any country against opposing forms of ideology.</p>

<p>In the end, the father becomes the nightmare his rules are meant to prevent,
and questioning the hypocrisy of such ridiculously deluded solutions of
seclusion are what seems successfully revealed in <em>Dogtooth</em>. It is this young
woman’s struggle to overcome these rules that Lanthimos masterfully defines as
a universal metaphor for a younger generation’s attempts to define their own
ways of functioning in a world rife in confusion, pain, and ultimately
ambiguous achievement.</p>
