<div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t make much secret about being an avid reader of the New York Times
movie reviews. Though my blogging brethren (and <a href="http://www.askoxford
.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/brethren?view=uk">sistren</a>) offer prime insight, I
came of age as a critic reading A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, oscillating
between loving and hating them as my allegiances and beliefs have grown over
the years. This week, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/movies/06dargis.html">Manohla added to the
conversation</a>
surrounding <em>Sex and the City 2</em>, which was reviewed for the Times by Mr.
Scott. We rarely get to see the opinion of both critics save for year-end
roundups, so this is an extra treat so close to release.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen <em>SATC2</em> yet, so one really ought to take my thoughts with a
grain of salt. I’ve enjoyed the smattering of episodes of the series that I’ve
seen and I found the first film funny, if grating. New York on film holds a
place dear to my heart. It seems even its most gifted celluloid sculptors have
had trouble reproducing it in the last decade (I’m talking to you, Woody
Allen). The dialogue around this latest fantasia, as Ms. Dargis points out, is
largely related to questions of ethnocentricity and racial sensitivities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To borrow a tactic from the TV show, which invariably featured Carrie posing
the week’s Big Question to her readers: Was “Sex” actually 50 percent worse
the second time around? Not from where I was seated, though I happily concede
that the sequel is about as bad as the original. They’re just lousy in
different ways. The new sex puns (“Lawrence of my labia”) are as wince
inducing as the old, and Mr. King’s direction remains strictly small screen.
What has changed are the locations: in the first film, the friends visit
Mexico (funny!), but this time, they yuk it up in the Middle East (not
funny!). But what has really changed? The characters, the critics, the
context: how quickly yesterday’s pleasure can pop, just like an economic
bubble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to agree with her. Like Michael Bay’s <em>Transformers 2</em> before it, this
film makes the perfect target for any number of derisions. Mexico is funny
because we don’t mind getting a little racist when it comes to our neighbors
to the south. When it comes to the Middle East, we tread softly because of
national tensions and, honestly, personal fears. So I’ll give Manohla, and
this film, that much.</p>

<p>Where I get annoyed, however, is in her closing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This and other scenes of the women with Muslims are often awkward, though
that’s partly a function of Mr. King’s direction. Yet there’s also something
touching about a few of these encounters, as when the women wonder how you eat
fries when you’re wearing a veil, a question that strikes me as an
uncharacteristically honest admission of difference in a mainstream American
movie. Too bad the women weren’t guys and went to Las Vegas, where they could
have indulged in the kind of critically sanctioned masculine political
incorrectness that made “The Hangover” such a darling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-
hangover/">I did not like </a><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-
hangover/">The Hangover</a></em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-
hangover/"> all that much</a>, and I completely agree with her sentiment that masculine stupidity
often goes unquestioned onscreen. However, that doesn’t exactly make for much
of an excuse. The first <em>Sex and the City</em> film was lauded for its ability to
rake in millions while boasting a cast of female leads, a rarity in this
business. The same goes for the show, though it should be noted that today
(not in 1998 when the show first aired) women are in control of television
programming in a big way. Phenomena like <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> and <em>Desperate
Housewives</em> are a testament to this shift.</p>

<p>Regardless, does the status of Carrie and pals offer leeway on their level of
political correctness? For my part, no. Nor should it let <em>The Hangover</em> guys
off the hook, but the difference there seems to be that that film knew exactly
what it wanted to be. If <em>SATC2</em> actually is a bad film, then hopefully it is
a bad film on merit alone. We should not forget that we now live in a world
where a woman has won an Oscar for Best Director, and for a film with no
female leads. I think it is short sighted to chalk negative reactions up to
critical sexism.</p>

<p>But I haven’t seen the film and I’m a dude, so what do I know?</p>
