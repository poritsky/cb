<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

1024x680.jpg" alt="" /></a>Overstylized, overdramatic and overcooked
are all understatements when describing Albert and Allen Hughes’ <em>The Book of
Eli</em>. The only facet of it I can speak highly of is Gary Oldman, who finally
returns to the baddie throne he built so long ago. Otherwise, the film is just
an exercise in technological possibilities on the part of the directors and
their team. We come along for their ride.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the visuals, which is clearly where The Hughes Brothers
devoted most of their efforts. Taking a page out of the <em>Sin City</em> and <em>300</em>
playbooks, the film is mostly greenscreened footage over a hyper-realistic
backdrop. It’s a style, no doubt, but one that is more grating than it is
interesting in this instance. Shot on the RED camera, foreground imagery seems
to break apart very quickly, at least on the print I saw. I don’t care how
many “K”s they put in the resolution, it really did not mix well with the
synthesized backgrounds. Besides that, this steampunk-chic post-apocalypse is
nothing new to audiences. So what do the Hughes Brothers bring to the table
that maybe we haven’t seen before? God!</p>

<p>Religion, specifically Christianity, is also a staple of any horror film worth
its salt, but rarely is it ever forefronted as in <em>The Book of Eli</em>. In short,
Denzel Washington, as the title character, heard a voice tell him to take the
only remaining copy of the King James Bible westward, so he does. That’s all
well and good plot-wise. Not only is a prophetic act of faith a classical
convention, but travelling West on a mission is about as basically litereary
as you can get; this plot ought to be an easy enough canvas to work with.</p>

<p>Enter Carnegie, the aptly named robber-baron who has built a cannibal-free
town through might alone. Played by Gary Oldman, this is the first time in
about a decade the British actor has embraced the his darker side. It suits
him well and it is nice to see him back in snarling form, but that doesn’t
change the fact that his character’s motivation is positively trivial. In
order to further rule over the scum of the earth, Carnegie sends teams out
every day in search of a bible. He explains that the book will give him
supreme power over the weakest walks of society, which is already everyone but
him. When Eli strolls into town, of course, the conflict comes with him. Gun
battles ensue with organized religion in the crosshairs, but the matter is
dealt with so moronically, there may as well be no conflict. With no conflict,
we have a movie I chuckle through while everyone else tries to pay attention.</p>

<p>Denzel broods, but it isn’t enough to save his character from futile
silliness. Early in the film, we see him pop in some earphones and go through
his evening routine. This is where the actor shines, expressing his brute
force during even the most sensitive of moments. The performance is nothing
near the multilayered characters he has built with action collaborator Tony
Scott. In the last ten years, Mr. Washington has been working through his
stardom, digging deeper and deeper on every outing for the beast within each
role. He <em>is</em> an action hero, and he bucks up here and offers as much as he
can.</p>

<p>Now about those headphones. (This is about to get nerdy) We know the film
takes place at least thirty-one years after “the sky opened”, so everything
has been in the shitter for awhile. Using, I assume, a solar charger, Eli
whips out a 3rd generation iPod (the same one featured in Wes Anderson’s
justifiably vintage <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>), which was introduced in 2003.
The he grabs some Dr. Dre Beats headphones, which are displayed prominently a
few times and were introduced, at the earliest, in 2008. Besides the fact that
iPod batteries rarely last more than two years, when the hell did this
apocalypse happen?! How much of a hipster was Eli that he kept his five year
old iPod laying around when he bought brand new $200 Beats just before the
world turned to poo? (Last niggle: where did Mila Kunis get all those form
fitting jeans if all the Gaps and Diesels perished before she was born?) I’d
like to ignore the little things like this, but without a decent conflict, I
had to focus on something for two hours.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to mention the only other thing worth mentioning
(pejoratively) in this film: the long take. Just like <em>Atonement</em> before it,
<em>The Book of Eli</em> features a shot whose purpose is to show off the technical,
and this case technological, prowess of the people behind it. A climactic
gunfight features a handheld camera that bobs and weaves between bullets,
through windows, under cars and over rockets. It’s ridiculous, but the real
trouble with it is that the scene would only be enhanced by editing. I am so
tired of filmmakers doing things for the sake of doing them. Is it a feat of
cinematic science? Sure it is, but what’s the point if the scene doesn’t call
for it? I implore younger filmgoers to consider these things when they watch
the RPG-like scene go down. I’m sure praise will be heaped on cinematographer
Don Burgess in certain circles for pulling this off, but one must ask why the
shot exists. If you can come up with an answer that suits you, then you’re
set. I cannot.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>The Book of Eli</em> could have been a much better film if only the
villain’s motivation were a a bit more foreboding and the anachronistic
goofiness, manifested in unfortunate product placement, were nixed. The post-
apocalypse seems like a fun place to play, I only wish this film didn’t offer
so much more of the same we’ve been seeing for years. It’s an overwrought <em>Mad
Max</em> with a biblical twist. That should either sell you or not.</p>
