<div class="entry-content"><p>Apple’s iPad is 2 months from release and the Internet seems to have already made up
its mind on the device, one way or another. This is all based on total speculation as
even those who have handled the tablet haven’t done so long enough to offer an informed
opinion. So while the mud and rainbows sling elsewhere, I would like to speculate how
the device will impact filmmakers should it be embraced after launch.</p>

<p>First off, let’s look at the iPhone/iPod Touch which has enjoyed decent success in the
film community. There are apps available as simple as <a href="http://www.aja.com/news/index_article.php?id=101">AJA’s data rate
calculator</a> for estimating video file
sizes and as complex as screenwriting applications. You can plug your iPod into an
<a href="http://www.alesis.com/protrack">Alesis ProTrack</a> and record audio via XLR mics. This
doesn’t even to mention the simpler things like the video capabilities of the iPhone
3GS which gives any maker the ability to shoot a walkthrough or concept video whenever
they deem necessary. Today, the filmmaker finds a decent tool in the iPhone/iPod Touch.</p>

<p>So when voices on the internet decry the new iPad “just a big iPod Touch”, I would ask
the dissenters how they could consider that a bad thing. The truth is that if it were
<em>just</em> a big iPod Touch, it would already solve a great deal of problems with the
smaller screen on Apple’s mobile devices. Even though the device isn’t available in the
wild yet, it is fast becoming clear that the iPad is something more than a glorified
iPhone. Take a look at some of the advanced gestures possible on the iPad in this video
compiled by Gizmodo:</p>

<p>The way Phil Schiller “stacks” those Keynote slides with a two touch gesture is
something that has never been available on any Apple touch device before, and it is a
sign of things to come. Gesturing is about to go way past touching and swiping. So how
could this impact filmmakers? Let’s break it down by department.</p>

<h2 id="pre-production">Pre-Production</h2>

<p>There are some obvious places Pre-Production can use the iPad. On the somewhat mundane
side of things we have <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/app-store/">iWork</a>, Apple’s
desktop-class suite of productivity applications available (I assume) for the device on
Day 1. One could use Numbers on the iPad to figure out a budget, and Pages to make
notes at a meeting or perhaps even markup a script breakdown. But this is basic
productivity that all users, filmmaker or otherwise, will benefit from.</p>

<p>Nearly every iPhone app will run on the iPad, so the tools I mentioned above should all
work on the iPad out of the box. However, each app will be somewhat crippled by its
intended resolution, running a blockier version to fill the 9.7” screen. The developer
behind <a href="http://www.blackmana.com/iphone/products/screenplay">Black Mana’s Screenplay</a>
has already announced an <a href="http://www.blackmana.com/iphone/support/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=105">iPad
version</a> that should
be ready by the product launch. According to the company’s forums, the application will
be for the writing professional, meaning perhaps this will be a full-fledged
screenwriting application. With Apple’s keyboard accessory, the screenwriter could find
him/herself taking up a much smaller footprint at the coffee shop while getting some
serious work done.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest and most ambitious announcement comes from
<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a>, who writes the iPhone GTD application
OmniFocus. A committed Macintosh development firm, Omni has been coding best in class
applications that run alongside traditional productivity suites like iWork or Microsoft
Office. <a href="http://blog.omnigroup.com/2010/01/29/ipad- or-bust/">They have announced plans to bring five of their desktop applications to the
iPad</a>. OmniOutliner is an
organizational application whose feature set goes far deeper than outlining. However,
it does do outlining tasks particularly well and would make idea organization extremely
portable. OmniPlan is a powerful project management application. Given how many moving
parts a film production has and the open nature of OmniPlan (it is extremely
customizable), I could certainly see an entire production being planned out inside of
the application. Then it could be tweaked throughout the production on the minimalist
device. (On a sidenote, Omni is a very big Mac developer whose excitement over the iPad
should not be taken lightly. That they are interested in the platform is reason enough
for creative professionals to take the iPad seriously.)</p>

<p>Back to film specific apps, we have <a href="http://www.cinemek.com/storyboard/index.php">Cinemek’s Storyboard
Composer</a>. While the application is
heavily tied to the iPhone’s camera, which the iPad lacks, and the developers have yet
to address iPad availability, there is no question that the application will continue
to be useful for filmmakers. Personally, I prefer a blank page to storyboard on so that
I can be as unruly as I like, which is where <a href="http://brushesapp.com/">Steve Sprang’s
Brushes</a> would come in. Demoed at Apple’s iPad launch last
week, the application allows you to “paint” with your fingers right on the screen.
Brushes features a powerful toolset of layering and customizable brush settings.
Famously, the iPhone iteration was used to illustrate three New Yorker covers. I’m sure
the iPad version will only make it easier to draw, which would work in tandem with
Storyboard for powerfully organized drawn shot breakdowns.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p>Moving onto the Production phase of a film, let me get back to Omni and discuss
Omnigraffle, a vector-based diagramming application. Not only could a Cinematographer,
Gaffer or a Production Designer use it in Pre-Production to plan out whole shoots, but
imagine having lighting plots and set schematics available digitally on set. A
production could plan exterior shoots with multiple lighting plans all in one iPad, so
when the sun shifts or cloud cover comes in they could quickly access a backup. Better
yet, when you arrive at a location to find a vital aspect of the room has changed, say
the art director changed a circular table to a longer rectangular one, you could
quickly adjust the change and deploy your light and camera plots via the iPad. The
precision OmniGraffle offers, down to the inch, allows for a slimmer margin of error
than plain old paper and pencil. That means that even the most complex of shots can be
easily imagined in an iPad before doing a trial and error on set. A handful of swipes
could save hours worth of mistakes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davideubank.com/Good_Focus/pCAM_Film+Digital_Calculator.html">pCam</a> is a
fascinating tool that offers the cinematographer a bevy of mathematical assistance
onset. It’s doubtful the app will be rebuilt for the iPad as its functionality won’t
necessarily benefit from the larger screen. But it’s certainly worth mentioning; after
all, there are working professionals out there who don’t own an iPhone but may be in
the market for an iPad.</p>

<p>Anyone overseeing continuity could load a days worth of photos, either directly with
Apple’s Camera Connection kit or via USB sync with iTunes/iPhoto. Literally thousands
of photos would be accessible and viewable so you could zoom in on that glass mug in
the corner and see how much tea was left in it. While this is possible with an iPhone
right now, the added screen real estate will make the job even easier. I should also
mention that most of these tasks could be done with a laptop, but imagine the
difference between walking around to every corner of a location holding a laptop and
holding an iPad. Swiping and double tapping a 1.5 pound flat screen device seems a lot
easier than setting down a laptop every time you need to change photos or click the
zoom button.</p>

<p>Script supervisors could be reading and annotating the script throughout the day. They
could flip pages without even making a sound, keeping your audio department happy.
Break out Numbers again so the Line Producer can track how over budget you are. While
s/he’s at it, why not make any changes to tomorrow’s call sheets before printing them
out (potentially via bonjour). Basically, imagine anyone on a filmset who now carries a
clipboard or folder toting an iPad instead.</p>

<h2 id="post-production">Post-Production</h2>

<p>Post production has long been the most computerized of departments. Ever since the
advent of  digital, or non-linear editing (NLE), systems, Post has given itself over to
bits and never looked back. Let’s start with the sound department.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.folabs.com/proremote.html">ProRemote</a> is a powerful application that brings
audio sliders to the iPhone. I’m not positive that an iPad specific version is in
development, but if it is it could prove indispensable. Essentially, the iPad would
turn into a mixing board for ProTools and other audio applications. Not only would this
give amateur mixers the tools they need for (relatively) less money than a hardware
solution, but the portability of the iPad would give a multi-touch mixing pad to
location sound personnel.</p>

<p>Dailies deliveries could very well be revolutionized by the iPad. A company like
<a href="http://www.sampledigital.com/">Sample Digital</a>, whose DAX/D3 systems offer robust and
secure dailies viewing through a proprietary app, would do well to offer up an iPad
edition of their software. The dailies and cuts for an entire shoot could be accessible
securely in an iPad, moving the mess of hefty files and disc media to remote servers,
allowing producers, writers and department heads to see anything they want at the tap
of a screen. (Note: Sample Digital’s current workflow, while impressive, utilizes a lot
of non- Apple tools, so I doubt this is something that will happen for quite some time.
That being said, they are not the only game in town for digital deliverables and
someone else could very well make this happen.)</p>

<p>Finally, for the pie-in-the-sky use case, I will come out and speak for all filmmakers
who have embraced the digital age: we want a full-featured mobile touch-screen video
editing solution. The obstacles are great, but the idea is actually quite simple. When
Google Wave was first introduced, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-wave-for- filmmakers-a-concept/">I suggested how it could be used to host a complete
edit of a film via XML
documents</a>
. Since non-linear editing is non-destructive, technically all you are manipulating is
timecode, which is text in a document. We know the iPad can handle some pretty complex
bits of video (H.264 at 720p requires some serious processing power) and we know it can
handle text well enough to run a desktop class word processor. So hardware, save for
disk space, isn’t really the issue. The newest, most tricked out Mac Pros often have
horsepower to spare, so I could envision a world where media is transcoded to iPad
specific codecs in the background, then synced to the iPad for manipulation on the
road. I want to be clear about this: we don’t need transitions, we don’t need titling
effects, we just need to be able to play down and tweak our work on the subway if we
feel the need to. That is, for now. Envisioning building 3D Motion graphics by pinching
and zooming gets me all excited, but I’ll hold off on that capability in hopes of an
NLE, perhaps Final Cut Touch.</p>

<p>So there you have it, just a few filmmaking use cases for Apple’s latest invention, the
iPad. Bear in mind that this entire post has been written sight unseen. Just as when I
first took the wrapping off the iPhone I had no idea I would one day be doing
crosswords on it and recording podcasts, the iPad’s future is completely unknown.
However, for those of us who can see its potential now, there are some immediate
advantages it offers that we can benefit from.</p>
