<div class="entry-content"><p>It takes almost no time to demystify Darren Aronofsky’s <em>Black Swan</em>, which is
a real shame because its slight of hand is most of what it has going for it. I
spent most of its duration guessing where it could be headed besides the
obvious, but I was left sorely disappointed by the end. Aronofsky has made a
striking film that will certainly incite discussion if only for his
referential technique (Deren’s <em>Meshes of the Afternoon</em>, Polanski’s
<em>Repulsion</em>, Argento’s <em>Suspiria</em>, and there’s probably more), but ultimately
it is empty, lacking the elements it so desperately tries to evoke, namely
sexuality, musicality and brutality.</p>

<p><em>Black Swan</em> is the story of Nina Sayers, a virginic dancer with a New York ballet company played by Natalie Portman. When she gets the lead spot in a new production of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake, she must grapple with her rigidity in order to fulfill darker side of her character’s dance. As the white swan, she is a perfect fit given her tightly wound prissiness; it is the black swan transformation that she has trouble with. Nina must access her dark side, her pent up sexuality,  in order to succeed.<br />
Swan Lake’s narrative, it is made clear, parallels Nina’s, a conceit that
becomes annoyingly obvious once Mila Kunis shows up as Lily, a wild,
disorganized and passionate dancer who wears exclusively black apparel
(shocker). The effect plays about well as in <em>Twister</em> where the baddies drove
black SUVs while the good guys towed around in white, which is to say it plays
predictably.</p>

<p>Aronofsky’s lack of a funny bone severely brings this film down. There are
laughs, but they appear by mistake. Two big ones break up masturbation
sequences (yep, plural). It’s not as much that the director should be bringing
proper laughs to this sort of a film, but if he had a clue about comedy he
could have avoided these awkward truncations. Moreover, if this film is
missing anything it’s a comedic self-awareness. So much energy is spent hiding
the mysterious, the phantasmagoric elements of the film that the human element
is never allowed to shine through.</p>

<p>When it comes to sex, Aronofsky seems to approach the topic too literally.
Just having two hot young actresses go at it does not make the film sexy. The
much ballyhooed lesbian scene plays mechanically, straightforward; not erotic.
There is a romance to the camera, to the editing that Aronofsky is missing.
The filmmaker is not making love with the tools he has at hand so the passion
falls flat. This doesn’t just go for the sex, either.</p>

<p>As a dance film, <em>Black Swan</em> is second rate. There is some inspired closeup
photography of Portman’s feet, plié-ing and pas de deux-ing all over the
place, and there are definitely a few wonderful sequences including Nina’s
final attempt at becoming the black swan. However, overall, Aronofsky treats
dance less as art and more as sport. Focusing on the feet of a ballet dancer
basically misses the forrest for the trees. <em>Mao’s Last Dancer</em> from earlier
this year had an atrocious narrative but at least its dance numbers were
impeccably executed. Aronofsky focuses on his gritty flourishes so much so
that we miss the point of the dance, which ultimately brings the story down.
If we never see why Nina loves to dance (but we do hear her say it) then why
should we follow the plot at all?</p>

<p>I’ll admit, I’m being a bit hard on this film, but I feel very strongly that
its shortcomings outweigh its successes. What it gets right are the cinematic
equivalent of parlor tricks, which is a grave frustration given how good this
film wants to be. When you remove the film’s plasticity, you are left with
nothing much at all but a 135 year old Russian ballet. I’d rather go see it at
Lincoln Center myself.</p>
