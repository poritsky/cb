<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2015/07/first-fn-cover.jpg" title="My First Field Notes" /></p>

<p>Last night I decided to tidy up my collection of <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes memo books</a>. For a few years now I’ve kept one in my back pocket everywhere I go. Even if most days I don’t grab for it, I’m happy to have it there just in case.</p>

<p>After organizing my unused and sealed books, I went to put my filled up books in order.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> With few exceptions, almost every memo book I’ve written in has functioned as a sort of ongoing journal. To-do lists, creative pieces and work-related notes are often mixed in with more diaristic writing, but there is certainly an order to the books.</p>

<p>While flipping through pages to find the dates they were started and finished<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> last night, I came across my first Field Notes memo book. I actually remember picking up that first three-pack, a limited edition <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/ravens-wing/">Raven’s Wing</a> from 2010, at <a href="http://www.mcnallyjackson.com">McNally-Jackson</a>, one of the great NYC book stores, long before I knew that these little notebooks would become pined after by collectors.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I was surprised to find a notebook that actually said flat out that it was the first of the collection. When I opened up this little black book, there it was staring me in the face. My first Field Notes. An occasion worth calling out back then, apparently.</p>

<p>The next thing that surprised me was how specific the entry was about my relationship to digital tools, and how excited I seemed to be to be putting pen to paper once again. I had no idea, back in 2011, that writing in Field Notes would become a habit. But it has.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be fun to post the first thing I ever wrote in a Field Notes here on <em>the candler blog</em>. This was never supposed to see the light of day, but I rather like reading it again four years down the line. I wonder what other little nuggets are hidden within my collection of little filled notebooks.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> So here it is: what a twenty-six year-old version of myself thought about writing his thoughts out by hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3/2/11</p>

  <p>Picked up my first Field Notes pack today. I’m not positive, but I believe this is my first notebook purchase since the iPad. Most of my writing has moved to an all digital format, something I’ve dreamed of from a young age. I had a Palm, and always wanted to try an iPaq because it seemed like a palm sized computer. But nothing compares to the ubiquity of the iPad and the iPhone.</p>

  <p>I now produce more content than ever before, and of a higher caliber than any other point in my writing life. My digital workflow is refined and something elegant. But not writing in notebooks has also taken its toll on me. I rarely write digital work that goes unpublished, whereas most of my notebook work has never been seen by anyone other than myself.</p>

  <p>In other words, on the computer, I rarely do any creative exploration anymore. My old notebooks are full of half-cocked stories.</p>

  <p>But enough about that. I’m going to try to get back in the swing of putting pen to paper and see how I do. I have atrocious handwriting. Digital acquisition has always been something of a favor to myself. Let’s see if I can even read my own writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two quick editorial notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I checked and I <em>had</em> been producing “more content than ever before” back in 2011; whether it was all that great (ugh, “high caliber,” Jon?) is something I’m scared to go back and adjudicate.</li>
  <li>Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAQ">iPAQs</a>?</li>
</ul>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For the curious here’s the breakdown:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>14 Sealed Packs (13 3-packs and 1 <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/artsandsciences/">Arts and Sciences</a> 2-pack)</li>
        <li>30 Singles</li>
        <li>30 Full Books</li>
      </ul>

      <p>101 books, plus the one I’m using right now. And honsetly I think a few more are hiding around the house…<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I haven’t filled out the inside covers on most of my books, which would have made this process easy. And no, I didn’t fill them out last night either.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>There’s a listing for a sealed Raven’s Wing 3-pack <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/SEALED-3-PACK-Field-Notes-Memo-Book-Ravens-Wing-RARE-/181771274795?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a52698a2b">on eBay going for $150</a>, which is high but actually not that much more than many would pay. There were only 15,000 of these books printed. For comparison, the latest “Colors” edition, <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/workshop/">Workshop Companion</a>, was a run of 102,000 books. It’s not exactly apples-to-apples (there are six unique Workshop books in each box wheras all the Raven’s Wing were the same), but suffice it to say: older editions are scarecer, and collectors are always on the lookout.</p>

      <p>Speaking of which, if anyone has a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/justbelowzero/">Just Below Zero</a> set they’d like to part with, <a href="http://candlerblog.com/contact/">be in touch</a>.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>I don’t revisit them often, because, <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/2008/08/01/good-for-records-precious-memories/">as the motto goes</a>: “I’m not writing it down to remember it later. I’m writing it down to remember it now.”<a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
