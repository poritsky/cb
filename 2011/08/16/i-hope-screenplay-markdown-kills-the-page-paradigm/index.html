<div class="entry-content"><p>In his post, <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2011/8/9/screenplay-markdown.html">Screenplay Markdown</a>, Stu Maschwitz articulated what has been
knocking about in my own mind for some time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The putzing-free fluidity with which I edit Markdown documents across
devices has made me even more grumpy about the sorry state of mobile
screenwriting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His first post, his <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2011/8/14/screenplay-markdown-progress.html">follow-up</a> and his <a href="http://prolost.com/storage/downloads/spmd/SPMD_proposal.html">“Syntax Proposal”</a> are great
reads.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve never seen someone so eloquently explain a use for Markdown in
plain English. Maschwitz is about as forward-thinking as they come when it
comes to film technology. Given the astounding number of comments his proposal
has received, you can tell he has struck a nerve. He certainly has with me.</p>

<p>probably be lost.</p>

<p>From the proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screenplay Markdown, or SPMD, is a proposal for a simple markup syntax that
would allow early drafts of screenplays to be edited in plain, human-readable
text. SPMD allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer,
using any software that edits text files.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By keeping the file as plain text, it becomes eminently mobile, able to be
opened on virtually any device with a screen, be it a smartphone, tablet or
computer, without any loss in quality. That would be a very cool thing.</p>

<p>The truth is that screenplay formatting itself hasn’t aged well. It has one
saving grace, that each page represents approximately one minute of screen
time, but even that shouldn’t mean all that much to a screenwriter. That’s the
stuff of “the biz,” the kinds of things a producer should worry about, not a
writer. Aaron Sorkin’s script for <em>The Social Network</em> weighs in at over 160
pages, yet the completed film’s length is two hours. Do you think he was
looking in the corner of his copy of Final Draft, sweating his page count?</p>

<p>When I was in high school, my introduction to screenwriting came from the book
<a href="http://lewhunter.com/">Lew Hunter’s Screenwriting 434</a>, a great entrée for a budding mind. Alas,
we all grow up and, well, our elders sound like windbags:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The staggering majority of quality scripts land Act One, the situation,
either side of [page] 17….The audience doesn’t want to wait to, say, page 30
to find out what they’re watching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then to math:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three into seventeen is almost six. Approximately six scenes at an average
of three pages each for Act One.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s not wrong. Lew Hunter is teaching a craft, preparing people with a
marketable skill like one would prepare a plumber or a mechanic. No one can
start to think out of the box unless they understand that it exists.
Conventions are important, but they are not everything. What Hunter’s and
others’ equally shrewd systems have done is make pagination gospel, make it
part of of the process. And so screenwriting applications rely on the page
paradigm, constantly reminding you where you are in your progress. The
creative process is more interesting than that.</p>

<p>The problem with screenwriting books, courses and professors (especially
professors) is that they all tend to produce similar results, which is to say
utterly similar films. This is a gross generalization, but we’ve all seen tons
of films, piles and piles of them, that feel workshopped to death and far too
reliant these kinds of conventions. You can’t look for where your page 17 is
if your working on pages that don’t have numbers. Which means to leap to
Screenplay Markdown, writers will have to leave behind the concept of a
“page.” Thank fucking goodness.</p>
