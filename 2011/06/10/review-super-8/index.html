<div class="entry-content"><p>I think in order to talk about J.J. Abrams’ <em>Super 8</em>, one must first talk
about “The Case,” the super 8mm movie directed by the titular young
protagonists that plays over the end credits of the film. It is a low-budget
zombie flick made by the rubenesque Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) and
starring all of his boyfriends plus one femme fatale. A detective must figure
out why people are turning into zombies before they kill his wife.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> In
short it’s a bunch of dudes making movies<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> because they can and they want
to: best summer ever. This creative process seems to be what motivated Abrams
when he set out to make a monster movie that could both stake a spot in the
genre’s canon and pay homage to it’s wondrous and oftentimes idiotic past. He
wants to give kids an old fashioned thrill, and he does so effectively in this
derivative yet enjoyable film.</p>

<p>zombie sub-genre that would find popularity later on. Ahead of his time.</p>

<p>but I would guess he had something to do with this being a story about dudes
making movies.</p>

<p>Even if he weren’t a producer, Steven Spielberg’s hand can be readily felt in
almost every frame of <em>Super 8</em>, and not only only from his early forays into
monster mayhem like <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> or <em>E.T.: The Extra
Terrestrial</em>. Abrams’ use (perhaps overuse) of lens flare feels quite a bit
like <em>War of the Worlds</em> and there is even a shot that feels lifted straight
out of <em>Munich</em>. This is not just a film for the plugged in fanboy (there’s an
insider <em>Star Wars</em> quip that got a healthy laugh in my theater) but an out
and out attempt to match directorial wits with Spielberg. Abrams is trying to
replicate the spirit of a young Spielberg film with the benefit of knowing the
director’s latter creative forks. It’s nostalgia of nostalgia.</p>

<p>But what of the story? The fun of Abrams’ concept and subsequent marketing is
that audience members are left mostly in the dark about what the film is
actually <em>about</em>. I can tell you there’s a monster and that it is rightly
obscured for the first two thirds of the film. M. Night Shyamalan, the one-
time “next Spielberg,” misfired in <em>Signs</em> by showing his (utterly lame)
monster too early. Restraint is only half the battle; the creature design here
is top notch. It’s a mostly original [redacted] geared to inspire wonder in
young minds. It’s all about the monster in <em>Super 8</em>.</p>

<p>That being said, much of the rest of the film feels too corny for a modern
audience[^3]. Most of the plot revolves around “vintage Spielberg”
conventions. Broken family in peril, misunderstood nerd, daddy issues, fear of
government, etc. Abrams put together a well-oiled and nicely sapped machine
here, but it’s important to remember that he is paying homage to bad movies.
The monster movies that boys watch at sleepovers have plots that are full of
holes and superfluous characters, faux emotional progressions and misplaced
messages. At one point a boy even yells “Drugs are so bad!” as a stoned adult
sleeps his way through a veritable war zone. It helps to have a PSA in your
monster movie so moms will feel okay making popcorn for the whole block.</p>

<p><em>Super 8</em> seems like a film from another era, which is especially fascinating given Spielberg’s history of hands-on producing. In the 1980s he earned a reputation as a backseat director for his protegé’s projects. He <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_(film)#Production">famously wrested most of <em>Poltergeist</em></a> away from Tobe Hooper. He also took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goonies#Production">some if not all of the reins</a> from Richard Donner on <em>The Goonies</em>, a film that seems to share a heartbeat with <em>Super 8</em>. In both of those cases, however, Spielberg took a “Story by” but not this time around. When we fade to black, the first credit that comes up is “Written and Directed by J.J. Abrams.” If the elder director did in fact keep his hands out of the honey pot this outing, then what does it say of Abrams who seems to have made a film that feels as closely watched over as those earlier works?<br />
[^3]:Perhaps that’s a relative stance. People in my theater got a kick out of
the trailer for the Kevin James starring <em>Zoo Keeper</em>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed I’ve spun an entire review without mentioning the plot or
most of the characters. Not only would it be tough to skirt around spoilers,
the truth is I think you’ll find a bevy of options online to whet your
palette, but in all honesty I say just go to the theater and experience it for
yourself. <em>Super 8</em> makes for a fun summer ride that’s worth the price of
popcorn. If you need more than that, look elsewhere.</p>
