<div class="entry-content"><p>As I linked to in my <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/08/leaked-
import-preferences-from-fcp-x/">last post</a>, a Twitter user today leaked a number of
screenshots from the forthcoming Final Cut Pro X and the as yet unannounced
Motion 5. The photos have been removed from TwitPic and the Twitter account
that shared them has now been taken offline. Luckily, blogs like <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/06/08/images_claim_to_show_apples_mo
tion_5_final_cut_pro_x.html">Appleinsider
</a> and
<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/08/leaked-screenshots-from-final-
cut-pro-x-and-motion-5/">Macrumors</a> Odds are these are legit. Apple previewed FCP X back
in April, and the one screenshot that comes from it looks pretty inline with
what they teased at NAB.</p>

<p>Apple promised to ship FCP X for $299 in the Mac App Store sometime in June.
These screenshots are the first we are seeing of Motion 5. Let’s poke around
the images and see what we see.</p>

<h2 id="fcp-x-import">FCP X Import</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/06/fcp_x_import_preferences.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/06/fcp_x_import_preferences-
1024x552.jpg" alt="FCP X Import Preferences Leaked Screenshot" /></a> Let’s start off with
Final Cut Pro’s video import settings panel. Here’s a transcript of what it
says in there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organizing * Copy files to Final Cut Events folder * Import folders as Keyword Collections * Transcoding * Create optimized media * Create proxy media * Video * Analyze for stabilization and rolling shutter * Analyze for balance color * Find people * Consolidate find people results * Create Smart Collections after analysis * Audio * Analyze and fix audio problems * Separate mono and group stereo audio * Remove silent channels<br />
### Organizing and Transcoding ###</li>
</ul>

<p>If these really are all of the settings editors are allotted for importing
tapeless format, there are going to be a lot of confused customers. My main
confusion is under the “Transcoding” menu. We’ve grown so accustomed to the
growing number of ProRes formats, are we now to understand that we are given
merely two options, “optimized” or “proxy” media?</p>

<p>Moreover, what <em>is</em> a transcode anyway? The first check box implies that FCP X
will simply move your tapeless media into the “Final Cut Events folder”.
What’s most interesting, for better or worse, is that that is even an option
at all. Will this folder operate somewhat like the iTunes Music folder, where
it keeps media consolidated if you like it to? Or will you be allowed to roll
your own file system structuring. Since FCP X is supposed to leverage every
processor in your machine to allow you to cut raw media, what are those
transcodes for? How come you can have <em>both</em> “options” and “proxy” media. I’m
not too worried about these options being set out the way they are, but I can
say, if this is real, they raise a lot of questions about what an FCP X
workflow actually looks like.</p>

<h3 id="video">Video</h3>

<p>Most of the video settings we see here are exactly what was teased at NAB, and
they are a very good sign. All of the seemingly superfluous, automated doodads
(which may actually turn out to be life savers) that Apple is pushing hard can
be turned off. Many editors, after the original demo, were worried that FCP X
was going to start automating the entire cutting process, coloring video you’d
rather leave raw or getting rid of rolling shutter even if you want to keep
it. This screengrab implies that those processes won’t happen on ingest.
Instead, FCP X has the ability to “analyze” the media so that you can flip a
switch later to implement any quick changes.</p>

<p>Analyzing your footage for rolling shutter, making it easier to correct later,
can be a great feature, but it can also be a huge strain on your processor.
Though Apple says it will happen in the background, it’s likely that many of
these processes will slow down your cutting while the media is ingesting. So
it’s a very good thing you can turn off color and “people” analysis;
especially “people” analysis. I turned on face detection for four years worth
of photos when I first got Aperture 3. Not only did it take the better part of
a day to complete the process, but it ground Aperture to a halt while it
chewed through the photos. Thank goodness this is optional.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>I’m actually most excited for the check boxes listed here. The only one that
is scary is “Analyze and fix audio problems”. That’s like saying to the
computer to “make me dinner”; even if it pops out something edible, it
probably won’t be what you wanted. This kind of vague automation will prove
itself either useful or useless over time. Perhaps there’s another dialog in
which we can pick what fixes we would like to apply.</p>

<p>Still, that “Separate mono and group stereo” looks pretty great. I wish there
were a way to automate this into tape-based workflows. I’ve seen a lot of
mistakes made because people just don’t know how the tracks were recorded. Let
the computer sort that out. And that “Remove silent channels”? Bye bye 16
extra channels of DVCProHD.</p>

<h2 id="motion">Motion</h2>

<p>I realize I’ve already been long-winded about a single <em>supposed</em> Final Cut
Pro screenshot. The good news is I have way fewer opinions about a new rev of
Motion. Let’s start with the best one:</p>

<h3 id="project-browser">Project Browser</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_project_browser.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-conten
t/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_project_browser.jpg" alt="Leaked Motion 5 Project Browser Image" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the options users are presented when creating new Motion projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Motion Project * Final Cut Effect * Final Cut Generator * Final Cut Transition * Final Cut Title<br />
Now this could get fun. It’s starting to look like there is some deep
integration between Final Cut Pro and Motion. Anything effect generated in
Final Cut can now be created by you and your team. The sky could be the limit,
but it’s unclear how this would work exactly. For example, a “Final Cut
Effect” would presumably be a color or stylized type of overlay for video
clips. Do you have to create these for a single frame size and frame rate?
Will HD effects work on SD footage and vice versa? The same goes for
transitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this screenshot and it implications turn out to be true, then perhaps
Motion really has swallowed up Color. A Final Cut Effect could potentially act
as a sort of color grade or LUT that could be dropped on whole scenes. Or it
could be something we haven’t even thought of. Speaking of Color.</p>

<h3 id="wheres-color">Where’s Color?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_rgb_waveform.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_rgb_waveform.jpg" alt="Leaked Motion 5 Waveform Screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>This image is also supposedly from the new Motion. This would seem to be
pretty good proof that Color is now a feature within Motion 5. While there is
certainly need for a complex Waveform monitor in a motion graphics
application, this looks fairly complex, as does the waveform of whatever image
was loaded into the app when this was taken. Even if this waveform monitor is
only in Motion, it would seem to make the functionality of the two apps
redundant. Why not split them? Better, why not put Color right into Final Cut?</p>

<p>I love Color in its current form. not only is it incredibly powerful, but it
also promotes discipline among cutters. I know it’s not the best argument for
it, but by keeping Color and Soundtrack Pro as separate apps, cutters have
been forced to follow a traditional editorial model and actually lock picture
for good. Non-destructive editing systems have made tweaking so easy that an
edit could never end. Technically, you could always send a project to Color,
so some work, then bring it back, cut some more, then send it back out, but it
was a pain in the ass. It would have been the same pain in the ass to go to a
supervised color correct in telecine more than once. So we had to learn
discipline.</p>

<p>If Color has now been integrated into another app, that will make it even more
efficient and allow for quicker turnarounds. Maybe it’s just me who will be
tempted to tweak color, then tweak the edit, then tweak the color again… In
fact, that doesn’t sound too bad. I hope we get to see the real thing soon so
I can stop with this wild speculation.</p>
