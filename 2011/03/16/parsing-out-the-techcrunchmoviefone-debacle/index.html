<div class="entry-content"><p>After Summit Entertainment complained that a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/12/the-source-code/">TechCrunch
article</a> on <em>Source Code</em>
was too snarky, a publicity liaison for Moviefone conveyed the message of the
studio’s displeasure to the article’s author. She then proceeded to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/15/snarketing/">post the
email request online</a> and ball
out Moviefone and AOL for dictating editorial to TechCrunch at a studio’s
behest. Then <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/03/15
/moviefones-response-to-the-techcrunch-post/">Moviefone responded</a> with a post that didn’t help
their case all that much. It’s a very sticky situation, and many parties
screwed up here. Let’s take a look at who screwed up what.</p>

<h2 id="summit-entertainment">Summit Entertainment</h2>

<p>Summit should never have asked for an article to be changed. However, I work
with publicists all the time and this is par for the course. They put critics
and writers on the spot all the time. They are not journalists. From the
perspective of a publicity company, the press is simply a marketing outlet, a
place to get their client’s name in print to help sell tickets. It’s taking it
too far to say they have no ethics, but they are certainly not bound to any
ethical code as journalists are (or are supposed to be). So while I find their
action here reprehensible, there is no real recourse. Should Summit have
requested the article to be changed? Nope. Can I fault them for trying? Nope.
Their’s is a dirty business and it’s up to us to keep our business clean.</p>

<h2 id="unnamed-moviefone-liaison">Unnamed Moviefone Liaison</h2>

<p>If there is a patient zero or smoking gun in this mess, this person is it.
Parsing out the e-mail he or she sent, the language is actually extremely
careful. They’re not telling the writer to change the piece, they’re politely
asking if they would consider changing it. This is what Moviefone is using as
its defense of this person’s actions. TechCrunch is claiming that AOL is
dictating editorial to them through Moviefone, but since this person wasn’t
working in an editorial capacity everything is kosher, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. No one at any outlet should be looking out for a studio’s best
interests. It was out of line to suggest that TechCrunch take any action on
the post whatsoever. There are a few ways to respond to Summit in this
situation. You could flat out say “no way”; you could lie and just not convey
the message; or you could direct them to TechCrunch’s equivalent liaison. Had
that happened, we’d never have heard of this.</p>

<h2 id="techcrunch-writer-alexia-tsotsis">TechCrunch Writer Alexia Tsotsis</h2>

<p>In Alexia Tsotsis’s post, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/15/snarketing/">AOL Asks Us If We Can Tone It
Down</a>, she splits hairs by
linking Moviefone and AOL so directly. She has every right to be pissed by
that e-mail, but citing the unwritten arrangement that if AOL ever steps on
TechCrunch’s editorial toes they would publish any such correspondence doesn’t
make a lot of sense. Moviefone does not act as an overlord of TechCrunch, and
in fact they are closer to being on the same level in AOL’s family. This could
have been dealt with internally. Someone screwed up (see above), but that
didn’t necessarily have to result in the loss of credibility of an entire film
site. The post’s headline is patently false and Alexia knows it. TechCrunch
loves to fear-monger if it results in clicks, but this should have been an
exception. AOL didn’t ask them to change anything.</p>

<h2 id="moviefones-official-response-by-patricia-chui">Moviefone’s Official Response by Patricia Chui</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/03/15
/moviefones-response-to-the-techcrunch-post/">Pure, unadulterated horse-shit</a>. Here’s the steamiest bit
(boldface hers):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reality of our situation is that, as a movies site, we work with movie
studios every day, and it is in our best interests to stay on good terms with
them. Staying on good terms with studios means that we will relay information
if asked. <strong>It does not mean that we would ever force a writer or an editor to
edit their work for the sake of a studio – or anyone else.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe Patricia’s conviction in that last sentence, and as she points out
earlier in the piece, technically, no one was telling Alexia to change her
copy. But that’s splitting hairs. I’m more concerned with the bit about the
reality of Moviefone’s situation, about staying on good terms with studios. No
embargoes were breached, no arrangements upended. I can’t imagine how not
conveying this message would have injured the site’s relationship with Summit.
Moreover, her case is basically that keeping a relationship with Summit is
more important than journalistic integrity. It’s a dopey statement to make at
best. If it were a smaller film site perhaps no one would be surprised, but
given the size of Moviefone’s audience, it sounds weird to think they would
need to bend over backwards to keep a single studio in their Rolodex.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This all really comes down to the balance of journalism versus publicity, or
as Alexia Tsotsis would put it, Silicon Valley versus Hollywood. What
Moviefone forgot in this situation is that there is a balance of power between
the press and the movie studios. They may have the access to screenings and
movie stars, but we have the audience they want. We don’t have to bend to them
for anything because we <em>don’t</em> have to stay on good terms with the movie
studios any more than they have to stay on good terms with us. It’s a mutually
beneficial relationship.</p>

<p>It’s funny that this went down not 24 hours after I attended a panel at SXSW
called “The Blogger Centipede: How Content is Eroding Credibility”. The room
was full of elite film journalists (including current and now former Moviefone
writers) all discussing plagiarism and credibility in the blog age. Towards
the end of the session, the conversation moved to some of these issues,
specifically dealing with publicists who are using you for good clips. It took
almost no time for a situation to present itself which illustrates, at least,
how not to go about working as a film journalist.</p>
