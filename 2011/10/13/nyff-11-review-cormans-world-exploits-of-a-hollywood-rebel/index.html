<div class="entry-content"><p>It’s a real shame when I tell people “I just saw a documentary about Roger
Corman” and they ask “Who?” <em>Who?</em> Somehow Corman has been pushed to the wings
of the story of American cinema. The much ballyhooed “New Hollywood” of the
1970s may never have come of age without him, yet his name has been all but
rubbed out by the stars who would outshine him. Alex Stapleton’s excellent
<em>Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel</em> aims to put the spotlight back
on the man who changed the game for generations of filmmakers.</p>

<p>Roger Corman’s greatest talent has been making movies, and I mean that in the
most literal sense. The number of films with his name attached is astounding,
perhaps approaching one thousand by this point.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Corman turned his
operation into a well-oiled machine, one that could make films in less than a
week. His goal was never to re-invent the wheel, the thing that holds up the
Stanley Kubricks and the Paul Thomas Andersons of the world, but to be able to
make as many movies that could find an audience as possible.</p>

<p>has him at 395 as producer and 56 as director (mostly overlapping), but that
doesn’t account for everything he’s touched.</p>

<p>His stylings led him to be one of the most successful B-movie and exploitation
producers of all time, but there is a lot more to him. As it turns out, he is
rather offended by his reputation as a maker of trashy camp. As Stapleton’s
film explores, his life’s work has been less about making “bad” movies and
more about making films that tap into what audiences want. Yes, that has meant
a lot of breasts and a <em>lot</em> of explosions, but also a lot of work that, even
when it was forgettable, became the training ground for some of the world’s
top talent. Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard, Jonathan Demme and Francis Ford
Coppola are just a few of the names to have found their start under Corman’s
tutelage.</p>

<p>But what of the documentary at hand? Stapleton has made a great biography of a
man who history may soon forget. Even though his work is both prolific and
extremely accessible today<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> he is still somewhat unknown among younger
generations of cinephiles. Stapleton’s film elegantly, and enjoyably, moves to
correct that. It also tries to explain it. Just as it seems the book is closed
on Corman, Stapleton introduces a new villain: Steven Spielberg. One of the
film’s conceits, sparked by those close to Corman, is that <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Star
Wars</em> represented a major shift in the way the studios went after younger
audiences. These were basically Corman movies with massive budgets, and it all
but put him out of business, or at least pushed him into obscurity.</p>

<p>Netflix Watch Instantly.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting theory, but I’m not so sure I believe it. It’s often said
that those blockbusters were the turning point, downward, for American cinema;
they’re the reason why there are nothing but loud comic book movies in
theaters today. The biggest hole in that theory is that if the studios found a
way to attract audiences with Corman-esque films, couldn’t Corman simply step
in and become <em>more</em> successful? If Stapleton trips here, it is only because
she is too enthralled with her subject.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, <em>Corman’s World</em> is an excellent watch and a damn good time. The
doc features excellent closing credits in the grindhouse vain and a number of
artistic interstitials (enjoy the poster montage). Interviews with stars big
and small, young and old make for a great Hollywood tell-all, but the best
footage comes from a wonderfully unguarded interview with Jack Nicholson. If
you love Corman, don’t miss this one; if you don’t know who he is, get your
ass to a theater and learn something.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Corman’s World</em> will be screening as part of the New York Film Festival on Sunday, October 16 and 1:30pm with a special screening of Corman’s 1962 <em>The Intruder</em> starring William Shatner.
