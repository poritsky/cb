<div class="entry-content"><p>Josef Adalian reports for New York Magazine’s <a href="http://nymag.com/daily
/entertainment/2011/10/nbc_will_try_to_bridge_the_dif.html">Vulture</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are American TV viewers ready to flock to a network sitcom that explores
questions of faith and ethnic identity, not to mention the often tense
relationship between Muslims and Jews? …Vulture hears the Peacock is working
with Avalon Television to develop a small-screen adaptation of last year’s
British comedy film <em>The Infidel</em>, which had its U.S. debut at Tribeca and
then played here largely via cable video on demand platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got to see the comedy when it came to New York for the Tribeca Film
Festival. Here’s what I had to <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/chosen-
film-_the-infidel_/5496">say at Heeb</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comedy should be confrontational, and <em>The Infidel</em> crosses the line more
than a few times. Still, the light style somehow keeps even touchy political
and religious conflicts breezy. Like <em>Bend it Like Beckham</em>, the moral is “Be
yourself, hey, but blend just a tad.” That wrap-up might be a little too
simple for some, but without it the film would devolve into the same old
arguments that both peoples have been warring over for millennia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question as to whether or not American audiences are ready for a comedy
about religious strife on television is a valid one. After all, <em>The Infidel</em>
played in New York on the eve of the furor that was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park51#Controversy">Park51/Cordoba House
project in lower Manhattan</a>,
one of the most volatile issues during the summer of 2010. During the
festival, I had sit-down interviews with director Josh Appignanesi, writer
David Baddiel and stars Omid Djalili and Richard Schiff.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> You can <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/04/29/candlercast-16-a
-conversation-with-the-infidel-team/">listen
to the full interview</a>, but I think some of the excerpts below
shed some light on their approach to perceived controversy.</p>

<p>involved](http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/nbc-developing-comedy-series-
version-of-british-film-the-infidel-starring-omid-djalili/) in the development
of the NBC project.</p>

<p>I suggested to both Appignanesi and Baddiel that the film goes too far in
terms of controversial imagery, specifically one scene in which Djalili
appears in a concentration camp uniform. They had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>David Baddiel:</strong> If you actually deconstruct that particular gag, it’s not
a guy who just appears in a concentration camp outfit and the audience laughs
because he’s in a concentration camp outfit. It’s a Muslim who’s having a
nightmare about the idea that he is Jewish. His subconscious, comically, is
projecting himself as various Jewish monstrosities. To me, the one you’re
going to end on there is that one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Josh Appignanesi:</strong> What’s particularly funny about that is that the
monstrous things that you might imagine Jews to be involve them being the
worst victims of the twentieth century. There’s kind of quite an inverted joke
if you look at it closely and it’s quite a subversive joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DB:</strong> It’s also about an anxiety. When he goes to the computer and puts
the word Jew [in a search engine] and gets a lod of hate back at him, that is
real. Google had to change it because there was so much anti-semitism that
came off the web. The point is with Mahmud it’s something that hasn’t really
occurred to him. First he finds out that he’s Jewish and that’s a problem for
his identity, then he has to deal with the fact that, if you’re Jewish, you
will have anti-semitism to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JA:</strong> And you’ll have the Holocaust as part of your history.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DB:</strong> For me, with any joke, it’s not just like “Okay, you can’t make
jokes about that thing.” I <em>never</em> think that. What I think is that you have
to look at the individual joke and the context of that individual joke and
say, “Okay; or not.” There’s still going to be people that think it’s not okay
because they think some subjects are untouchable. All subjects are touchable
within contextual grounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked whether or not it had met much resistance in the UK.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JA:</strong> People keep saying, “It’s controversial,” but then, actually, it’s
not really clear where the controversy is. They sort of think it will be
somewhere else but not for them. They might feel, “A bit edgy. That was maybe
a bit close to the bone, but I don’t find it really problematic. I liked it.”
Then who do they think will find it problematic? It usually ends up [they
think] Muslims will find it problematic because they might kill you, because
of Salman Rushdie, because of whatever. Because of South Park now<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, because
there are reactive parts of 1.1 billion people. There are a lot of Muslims out
there, some of them are bound to be nutters.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the UK we had some worries because [neither myself nor David] are Muslim.
We had some Muslim people helping out on the film…producers, consultants for
the script and stuff, but we didn’t know for sure and we were a little
worried. They’ve embraced it more than anyone. That’s our big immigrant
population is essentially Muslim or if not Muslim then “brown” people who get
stopped at airports because of what’s been happening in the world and so
identify with this character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>had received a death threat](http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-
radio/2010/apr/22/south-park-censored-fatwa-muhammad) from an extremist Muslim
Web site based out of New York.</p>

<p>What became clear instantly is how seriously the creative team took this
material. The reason the film feels “breezy” is because they didn’t just run
with the same joke for the film’s duration. The idea of a Muslim man waking up
to find he is a Jew could easily be both offensive and funny, but they didn’t
create the film to push people’s buttons.</p>

<p>But will it play on American television, especially after the film hardly
played in the US? I think it can work, and Baddiel’s involvement in the
project is certainly reassuring. However, it’s tough to forget how divided we
are in this country on issues of religion. The Park51 incidents of 2010 and
this year’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/asia/02afg
hanistan.html?pagewanted=all">Koran burning</a> by Florida pastor Terry Jones don’t bode well
for an American public primed to comically approach its differences.</p>

<p>I’ll bet that Jews and Muslims would be the least offended by the actual
material if they saw it. More likely, as Appignanesi mentioned, it will be
condemned on the grounds that the Muslims will blow us up for it. Thankfully,
these guys realize that a powder-keg that big <em>must</em> be confronted. Why not in
sitcom form?</p>
