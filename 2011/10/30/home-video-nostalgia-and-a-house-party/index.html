<div class="entry-content"><p>I’m not sure what the party was for, but I distinctly remember finding myself
at the house of a screenwriter who lived in my area growing up. It was one of
those fancy parties that kids probably shouldn’t be brought along to but are
anyway. The owner split his time between coasts, wheeling and dealing in
Hollywood while finding a place to lay his hat in his suburban Philadelphia
manse.</p>

<p>There was never a time in my life that I didn’t want to work in movies. My
parents always encouraged and broadcast my aspirations. Perhaps this was why I
was brought along; to forge a relationship with someone in the industry. In
fact, the screenwriter did his best to needle me in the right direction,
though, being just a kid, I didn’t always follow along.</p>

<p>The first thing this kindly writer showed off to me was a small cupboard near
the front door of his house. Inside was a stack of home entertainment gear.
Amplifiers, receivers, radios; wondrous gear with all manner of digital
displays and knobs and switches. This was the control room for an
entertainment system that was piped through the whole house. The dining room
had recessed speakers hidden below molding. There were speakers in nearly
every room, even some outside. Was this a sound system with a house built
around it, or the other way around?</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” he told me.</p>

<p>As I recall it, we then all gathered into the living room, adults and children
alike. The screenwriter flipped on his big-screen television (rear-projection,
of course). He wanted to share something special with us, a justification of
his aural investment. Naturally, he put on the Tyrannosaurus Rex scene from
<em>Jurassic Park</em>, that most famous sequence that starts with a rumble and ends
with a car mirror. I melted listening to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/fullcredits#sound_department">incredible, layered
soundtrack</a>
of the 1993 film.</p>

<p>I had forgotten about this party and this experience, but it all came rushing
back to me while reading <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7155904/the-cult-jurassic-park">Bryan Curtis’s
article</a>
about the cult of the dino franchise over at Grantland. Earlier in the week I
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/28/the-best-jurassic-park-
article-youll-read-this-week/">excerpted</a> his piece on this site, but it’s worth
reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Jurassic Park</em>, along with <em>The Abyss</em> (1989) and <em>Terminator 2</em> (1991),
were the stars of an amazing in-between period of summer-movie history. An
interesting couple of years between the Analogue Era and the Computer Era. We
were charging headfirst into the movie future, but we hadn’t quite left the
past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of what keeps me coming back to this particular film is nostalgia. I long
for the days when I was a boy whose socks could still get knocked off from
even the cheapest of tricks. But there is something more at play here.</p>

<p><em>Jurassic Park</em> and its antecedents were created for the big screen, but there was a certain magic to these films that allowed for them to be enjoyed brilliantly in the home. The technological advances of the 1990s were not limited to the theatrical experience. Where the “home theater” was once the playground of the über-rich, it has become an attainable reality for many. While prices haven’t hit rock bottom, the quality on the dollar you can get in your living room these days is far more reasonable than at any other point.<br />
When I hear film people talk about home viewing it is usually in the context
of the death of the theatrical experience. Usually, I’m inclined to agree; I
love nothing more than sitting in a darkened room with a bunch of strangers,
ogling whatever bogeymen or beauties slink across the screen. Still, I have
had many (many, many) great experiences on the couch, in bed, sprawled on a
floor or otherwise irregularly comfortable in my own or another’s home. Is
that so bad?</p>

<p>The memory described here is important because it was <em>special</em>. Sure, I only
watched a single scene and the purpose of the showing was more a braggadocious
muscle-flex than a celebration of cinema, but that didn’t stop me from
entering the world of the film. Spielberg’s film is enduring for a number of
reasons, all covered in Curtis’s excellent aforelinked article. One that he
skips, however, is its ability to suck you in even at home. The throw pillows
and microwaved popcorn disappear right from the film’s opening lines
(“Gatekeeper, step forward!”), allowing us to re-enter the deadly Isla Nublar
time and time again.</p>
