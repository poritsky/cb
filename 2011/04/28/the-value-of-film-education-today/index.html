<div class="entry-content"><p>Two articles crossed my path recently that offer a bleak outlook for life
after college. The first is by indie powerhouse producer Ted Hope, <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.c
om/tedhope/archives/a_career_in_indie_film_better_have_that_second_job_lined_u
p/">A “Career”
In Indie Film? Better Have That Second Job Lined Up…</a> The other is from Malcolm Harris in the literary magazine <em>n+1</em> and
features an ominous (if Almodóvaran) headline, <a href="http://nplusonemag.com/bad-education">Bad
Education</a>. His piece is much colder
than Hope’s, offering mostly statistical analyses pointing towards a coming
implosion of the American higher-education system and admitting an overall
erosion of its quality over the last four or so decades. Here’s the crux of
it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If tuition has increased astronomically and the portion of money spent on
instruction and student services has fallen, if the (at very least
comparative) market value of a degree has dipped and most students can no
longer afford to enjoy college as a period of intellectual adventure, then at
least one more thing is clear: higher education, for-profit or not, has
increasingly become a scam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over on Hope’s side, focusing mainly on how aspiring filmmakers should expect
to get paid for anything but making films, he proffers these questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we would have more directors, producers, and writers creating more
wonderful work, if we understood better how to earn a living doing one thing
while we give our heart and mind to something else entirely. What are the jobs
that lend themselves to a second profession on the side? How do people gain
the skills that allow them to juggle to careers? What would such a practical
curriculum look like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about this two-years ago in the post <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/22/starting-out-in-film-now-what/">Starting Out in Film, Now
What?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This may seem obvious, but a lot of film schools in the U.S. teach you the
basics of many different fields instead of forcing you to master one. There’s
nothing wrong with that, it’s great to have a wide swath of knowledge as you
start out in the world… If you want to find a job within the film industry you
will have to hone your knowledge in on one specific aspect of the biz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In theory, I agree with Hope, whose experience and insight is worth far more
than mine. What he leaves out, however, is the cold hard fact that Harris
shines a light on: that undergraduate film programs are, by and large, a scam.
I believe in film education and I believe in the university model, but
universities are now run like corporations and the money they are pulling in
isn’t used to attract better faculty. It’s used to attract “better” students.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal for large state universities and elite private colleges alike has
ceased to be (if it ever was) building well-educated citizens; now they hardly
even bother to prepare students to assume their places among the ruling class.
Instead we have, in <a href="http://marcbousquet.net/tableofcontentshtuw.html">[Marc]
Bousquet’s</a> words, “the
entrepreneurial urges, vanity, and hobbyhorses of administrators: Digitize the
curriculum! Build the best pool/golf course/stadium in the state! Bring more
souls to God! Win the all-conference championship!” These expensive projects
are all part of another cycle: corporate universities must be competitive in
recruiting students who may become rich alumni, so they have to spend on
attractive extras, which means they need more revenue, so they need more
students paying higher tuition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my four years at college, I saw all of the changes that Bousquet describes.
Loft-style dorms with luxury amenities, the largest computer lab in the
country at that time and a multi-million dollar apartment for the school’s
president (2 miles away) were a few steps in the corporatized direction my
alma mater took. Meanwhile, our film equipment barely changed from the day I
entered to the day I left, even though the industry was shifting, rapidly, to
HD tapeless workflows.</p>

<p>If, as Harris suggests, the university system is broken, then isn’t the film
school model in just as much disarray? Film programs looks good in a brochure
and often attract wealthy students. The university takes the gamble that most
of film students will change direction at some point and move to a different
discipline, thereby sparing a strain in resources. Also, a student who hits it
big in the film industry offers something even better than a donation:
celebrity. Having a film program today is simply good business.</p>

<p>But what of the education? It’s important to remember that most of the
filmmakers studied in film schools came of age in a time when no such academic
programs existed. The truth is that we don’t <em>need</em> film programs at all. Put
another way, one can’t practice medicine without having gone to medical
school. But to make a film? There is no board that can certify you, no
credential that designates you. The study of film, then, must be, to borrow
Harris’s phrase, a pursuit of “intellectual adventure.”</p>

<p>Which brings me back to Ted Hope’s point. Learning how to survive while doing
something you love is tricky, perhaps harder than can fit in any curriculum.
Go to any festival and you will see the filmmakers who sell themselves well
enough to either get by or get beer money off of their work. This isn’t a
measure of their artistry, but perhaps finding a way to turn film into a
paycheck is an art all its own.</p>
