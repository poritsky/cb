  <div class="entry-content"><p>How does one even begin to review a film like <em>Cabin in the Woods</em>, whose very premise is a spoiler? That’s the question that has been bugging all the film journos (well, most of them) here at SXSW.</p>

<p>When he introduced the film at the premiere last night, producer and co-writer Joss Whedon implored the audience to enjoy the film and not tell anyone what it’s after the credits rolled. He recommended we just call it “awesome” and tell our family and friends to see it.</p>

<p>So here’s the thing: this movie <em>is</em> awesome. It manages to be a great horror film and a great comedy <em>and</em> a great something-something-lips-are-sealed at the same time. It’s increasingly rare to find a film that turns a genre on its head while still staking claim to a level of originality, but that’s exactly what we have here.</p>

<p>So what happens in Drew Goddard’s movie?</p>

<p>Everything…
Goes…
Nuts.</p>

<p>You think you know why a group of stereotypical hardbodied coeds are in for a horrific say at the eponymous cabin in the woods, but you really don’t. (One hint: Goddard wrote 9 episodes of <em>Lost</em>. <em>Cabin</em> will make you wish he wrote the final season.)</p>

<p>It feels like Goddard and Whedon knocked it out of the park on this one. This film is fun and refreshing. It’s good for the horror fan and, well, the Whedon fan in us all. I had a blast.</p>

<p>Go see it when it comes out in April and let’s talk specifics then.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Can a computer look at this video of a diseased cat and know that humans will laugh at it? Probably not.</p><footer><strong>-Neetzan Zimmerman</strong> <cite>Founder of the Daily What</cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I just attended a session at SXSW called &ldquo;<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_FP990224">Man Vs. Algorithm: Online Video Curation Face-Off</a>&rdquo;. It offered the following description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human or Machine? Who really knows what videos you&rsquo;re going to like best? Online video curation is in a heated battle between algorithmic curation and human, editorial selection. Let&rsquo;s settle this debate once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Settle it they did not. The session&rsquo;s moderators, Marc Hustvedt, co-founder of TubeFilter and Head of Strategic Partnerships at <a href="http://chill.com/">Chill</a> (a position and company I&rsquo;ve never heard of), and Neetzan Zimmerman, editor of <a href="http://thedailywh.at/">The Daily Wh.at</a>, were supposed to actually do some kind of experiment during the session. It didn&rsquo;t pan out because, as Hustvedt tried to explain, it would just be too hard to do in a session that short.</p>

<p>Instead they talked about video curation on the web, both the kind done by computers and the kind done by editors like Zimmerman, whose track record is somewh.at (I couldn&rsquo;t resist) prolific. The conversation of man vs. machine really boils down to editors vs. algorithms. YouTube, for example, parses all kinds of data to determine which videos humans would like to see.</p>

<p>However, humans can do better because of that impulse that tells you &ldquo;this is a <em>something</em>.&rdquo; The above quote from Zimmerman is about the viral video &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_S5cXbXe-4">The OMG Cat</a>,&rdquo; which is just a short clip of a cat with lockjaw. The expression makes the cat look like it is surprised, like it is more human. Zimmerman rightly points out that a computer can&rsquo;t see the inherent value in something like that.</p>

<p>The virality of online content is something that seems almost impossible to measure. Zimmerman mentioned in the session that he can&rsquo;t really explain in finite terms what it is that makes one cat video better than another, but he certainly knows it when he sees it. It&rsquo;s possible that there is something happening in our bodies when we have a &ldquo;gut feeling,&rdquo; something more chemical than visceral, that computers will one day be able to replicate.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever launched a story or a video or had a scoop knows that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to explain how it is that something goes from just existing to being an event. When you write (or, critically, read) online long enough, you can start to tell what&rsquo;s going to hit and what&rsquo;s going to get lost, but there&rsquo;s no perfect way to predict it. It seems for a computer to fully understand viral videos, they would have to fully understand humans.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I think humans are going to be necessary in the editorial game for years, if not generations, to come. Now enough blogging about blogging; I&rsquo;ve stories to find.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stu Maschwitz has put together a <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2012/3/8/write-better-with-fountain.html">great post</a> on how Fountain can help you write smarter. He highlights the newest implementation of Sections and Synopses in <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/02/08/fountain-for-marked/">Fountain for Makrked</a> to help build a story. As always with Stu, it’s never just about the technology. His closing here about outlining a story is beautiful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, the answer in arch-building is to use a wooden frame, or a <em>centring</em>. You build the frame, and lay the stones over it. When you remove the frame, the stones remain in place. The shape of the frame defines the shape of the arch, but the frame itself is discarded, an now-useless artifact of the arch-building process. The arch, however, is more beautiful for the precision of the frame—and appears to hold itself together impossibly, an intoxicating combination of monumental might and graceful weightlessness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a post worth revisiting often.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first piece for <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/2012/03/09/sxsw-film-preview-dont-judge-a-fest-by-its-centerpieces/">Turnstyle News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These screenings are basically marketing ploys, booked to help build positive buzz (ugh, did I really just use that word?) about a film before its release. A skilled marketer can pick out fests that will work to the advantage of the project at hand, but a misfire won’t really hurt a film’s image all that much. The reason is simple: festival audiences tend to really like movies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I come to SXSW this year without having seen a single film in advance, not even the shorts. The linked piece here is about how these big screenings sometimes seem out of place, but ultimately it’s a win-win for everyone, including the makers of smaller, indie fare.</p>

<p>Give it a read. More to come at Turnstyle during the fest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">James Cameron really likes the ocean depths:

<blockquote><p>This month, Mr. Cameron plans to plunge nearly seven miles to the planet’s most inaccessible spot: the Challenger Deep in the western Pacific, an alien world thought to swarm with bizarre eels and worms, fish and crustaceans. He wants to spend six hours among them, filming the creatures and sucking up samples with a slurp gun.</p><p>“It’s a blast,” Mr. Cameron said in an interview during sea trials of his new craft. “There’s nothing more fun than getting bolted into this and seeing things that human beings have never seen before. Forget about red carpets and all that glitzy stuff.”</p><footer><strong>-William J. Broad</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/science/earth/james-cameron-prepares-to-dive-into-mariana-trench.html'>The New York Times</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

While I doubt Cameron will ever be known more for his offscreen explorations than his films, I do like how far his passion for this stuff pushes him. Can&#8217;t wait to see the footage he brings back.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/03/the-future-was-then.html">Richard Brody found a French book on cinema</a> he had never heard of (a rarity). To borrow Brody’s word, the author, Roger Boussinot, was a “prophet.” Take the following excerpt from his 1967 text, “Le Cinéma Est Mort, Vive le Cinéma!” (The Cinema Is Dead, Long Live Cinema!), discussing how technology will advance to the point that everyone will be a filmmaker and how it will impact the form itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here, there’s something absolutely new that will emerge: …the character who evolves in front of the camera… is a raw reality that must be raised, as such, to a sort of abstraction, which is just what’s needed for it to attain a <em>communicable</em> truth: neither particular nor universal (this doesn’t exist), but relative. So, goodbye strict numbered shooting script, with the precise definition of shots, camera movements, placement of actors—that is, the cart before the horse. Between the cinema of theatrical convention and the cast-fishing of conventional journalism as practiced by Jean-Luc Godard, there’s a new form to discover in the realm of fiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That bit, written forty-five years ago, aptly describes the current state of indie cinema. Great find.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/03/readability-ios.jpg" title="Readability" /></p>

<p>Last week, after a long wait, Readability, the bookmarking and text-reformatting service, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/03/01/readability/">finally launched on iOS</a>. Now that I have been using to for almost a week, I have a few more thoughts on how the app fits into my workflow, but more than anything I found myself with questions about the service itself.</p>

<p>So I contacted Richard Ziade, founding partner of Readability, to pick his brain about the iOS launch and the company’s future plans. He was only too kind as he patiently answered my questions over email. Here is what he said.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p><em>The Artist</em> mimics the look and feel of a late 1920s silent film. The sets, the costumes, the makeup, the lighting, the camera work, the acting—even the way it’s written—makes you almost believe you are watching a classic of the silent era. Of course, you know it’s not. After all, there are recognizable modern actors in it, like John Goodman and James Cromwell. And, for me, there was the type.</p><footer><strong>-Mark Simonson</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/article/348">The Artist vs. The Lettering Artist</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Cinéphiles will probably chuckle at the idea that <em>The Artist</em> nailed the silent film era, but this article takes the film to task like nothing else I’ve read. Simonson exhaustively picks apart the use (and misuse) of type in the film.</p>

<p>Actually, his main gripe is that type was used at all; hand lettering would have been more common.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That took a hot minute.</p>

<blockquote><p>Aereo is a hot New York City start-up that plans to provide live streaming of major networks to a variety of mobile devices for a small monthly fee. They have $20.5 million in <a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2012/02/14/areo-20-million-hd-antenna-barry-diller-iac/">new funding</a> and plan to publicly launch on March 14, but were hit today with <a href="http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/pdfs/030112_Aereo_complaint.pdf">a lawsuit</a> by networks including Fox, Univision, and PBS, who claim that Aereo wants to broadcast without having &#8220;licensed this television programming from those who own it.&#8221; Oops?</p><footer><strong>-Joe Coscarelli</strong> <cite><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/03/aereo-facing-lawsuit-from-major-networks.html">Vulture</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://aereo.com/how-it-works">Aereo</a>, they’re a new service offering over-the-air programming (i.e. the stuff broadcast for free you can see with an HD antenna) delivered to a number of web-connected devices for $12 per month. They are set to launch in two weeks exclusively in NYC.</p>

<p>When you pay Aereo, you are basically renting a remote antenna (each customer gets his or her own) which you can access through apps or a web browser. Technically, it would be easy to set this up on your own at home with something from <a href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/home.en.html">Elgato</a>, but Aereo takes the technical know-how out of your hands.</p>

<p>I have a feeling the main point of contention the networks have is the fact that you can DVR programs in Aereo’s cloud. From the beginning, it sounded like a big fat licensing issue. You can bet this is the first of many lawsuits to come down on the company, which has chosen to launch in the media and lawyer capital of the world.</p>

<p>One of the many (not unfair) defenses of online privacy is that the programming is broadcast for free over the airwaves to begin with. Once a show goes public, it’s seemingly fair game to be recorded, transcoded and downloaded. The trouble is that Aereo is trying to charge up front for a service that works basically like a live-streaming torrent.</p>

<p>Maybe they’ll weather this storm with their $20.5 million. Maybe they’ll even beat the networks at their own game and put a decision on the books that allows for live-streaming of publicly available broadcasts. Those are some big maybes.</p>
