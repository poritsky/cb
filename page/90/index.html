  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thebestthingsince.com/blog/blog_images/up_still.jpg" alt="" />The folks
at Pixar are an eclectic group. Over the years they have moved on from their
roles as technological pioneers to animation revolutionaries of sorts, trying
to boldly bring the form back into maturity after it has long been relegated
to the stuff of Saturday morning television. It is no surprise then that <em>Up</em>
does everything in its power to subvert our preconceived notions of the
animated film. The main character is neither young nor cuddly, the themes are
complex and layered, and death is a very real possibility in the world of the
film. Still, this is a Disney film so it hits most of the marketable
requirements.</p>

<p><em>Up</em> is the story of Carl Fredrickson, and elderly widower who decides to
float his house to South America, fulfilling a wish he and his late wife have
shared since childhood. After takeoff, a young boy scout named Russell is
discovered as a stowaway and becomes Carl’s unwanted sidekick. The team makes
it to their destination, running into some new friends: Kevin, a giant bird
with a knack for trickery, and Doug, a cheerful dog equipped with a collar
that allows him to speak. These new visitors set up a mad-cap adventure for
the two city-dwellers, and we are invited along for the ride.</p>

<p>Parents should be warned that they will have to have some serious talks with
their kids upon viewing, including but not limited to death, infertility, and
non-amicable divorce. Just like <em>Wall?E _and</em> The Incredibles_ before it, <em>Up</em>
reaches for an audience past its target demo of toddlers, tykes and tweens. It
is also grounded in reality much more than any other Pixar film. This is not
the future or a bug world or a toy world, this is our world. By keeping the
story in the here and now, the audience must actually suspend belief much
further than they do for more fantastical fare. A viewer may spend a bit more
time scratching his head during <em>Up</em>, but the emotional progression of the
story is clear enough to allow one to set aside logic for a little while.</p>

<p>This film is also Pixar’s first foray into the world of 3D presentation. As a
concept, 3D projection has its own own set of issues that any filmmaker must
overcome. For one, audience members need to be enticed to don the plastic
goggles required to see the film as such while not bogged down with stuff
flying at their faces for too long. Directors Pete Doctor and Bob Peterson
strike a nice balance in this regard, using the third dimension to enhance the
story rather than as a cheap parlor trick. After a little while, 3D melts away
and you are only reminded of it when something actually does jump out at you.
Employing classical methods reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock’s <em>Dial M for
Murder</em>, that director’s lone 3D dabbling, such as subtly placing objects in
the foreground, inviting the viewer to “step into” the frame, visually. It is
a nice touch.</p>

<p>I will say that I was less than pleased with the fact that the only way to see
this movie in 3D is digitally projected. I have always had trouble viewing
Pixar films on DVD since they are coming direct from their digital source
instead of from a film print. The effect is much colder and less organic than
what you are used to, and with digital projection you feel as though you are
basically watching a movie in s giant home theater. Motion is a little choppy,
ironically, because there is too much information coming from the screen. Our
eyes have trouble keeping up; it looks hyper-real. Over time, the projectors
and delivery systems will only get better, and I’m nitpicking right now. Back
to the film at hand.</p>

<p><em>Up</em> is the perfect film for Pixar to make right now because it is so
unexpected. Every other animation company is picking up the crumbs they leave
behind, yet they keep raising the bar far above what anyone else is capable
of. This film would never work as a live-action piece, but that is exactly the
point. Animation is not a tool for Pixar but a movement. Thankfully, they are
moving it in the right direction, forward. (Or up, if you would like to end on
a more pithy note.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[caption id=”attachment_727” align=”alignright” width=”307” caption=”Still
grabbed from Hulu.com”]<img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/conan.png" alt="Stil grabbed from
Hulu.com" />[/caption]</p>

<p>I just wanted to take a little (<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/01
/conan-takeover-requires-viewing-of-the-late-shift/">more</a>) time to talk about the
new “Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien”. As you know, the television landscape
is rapidly changing. Fewer people are tuning into scheduled broadcasts and
more are watching them online, on DVR or Tivo. So it seems that the best thing
that anyone can do is to breath new life into one of television’s aging
strongholds.</p>

<p>I remember when the whole late night debacle went down in the early 1990s.
Initially, I was devastated that David Letterman was replaced by a nobody. Who
was this Conan, and could he really fill the hilarious shoes of his
predecessor on Late Night. Worse than that, oy, Johnny Carson was replaced by
Jay…JAY! Even as a youngster I didn’t think he was funny. It was a shame
because Johnny had built such an incredible home for America at 11:30.</p>

<p>Moving on…</p>

<p>The joke ended up being on me. Letterman moved to CBS with a hilarious new
show while Conan slowly built one of the smartest shows on television. Much of
“Late Night’s” appeal under his tutelage was not only his charisma, but a grab
bag of memorable characters and sketches. From the long-running “In the Year
2000” to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog to the claymation episode, the Conan
show has been a hotbed for creative release. This shouldn’t be a surprise from
a guy who penned some of the greatest Simpsons episodes in the early years of
the show.</p>

<p>Less of a performer than he is a writer, Conan is now entering this new space
without changing much, it seems. Watching last night’s first episode, the only
thing different from his old show was the color palette. The dark backgrounds
are gone, making way for brighter colors. This almost feels like daytime
television it’s so bright. But it’s still the same variety show it has been
for decades.</p>

<p>The worriers who think that Conan won’t be able to work at 11:30 are nuts. He
is going to do great, not only based on his first show but based on logic. He
has grown and adapted over the years. He came from behind as the dark horse of
late night television and has weathered many storms over the years. He’s not
only going to do great, he’ll move the show in a more positive, more hilarious
direction.</p>

<p>I think we are looking at the next king of late night here; a new Johnny
Carson. I believe that Conan will probably do this show into his old age just
as Mr. Carson did. Maybe I’m wrong, or maybe I’m just greedy, because Conan is
damn funny. I’ll be inviting him into my home until there is no more broadcast
television or he goes off the air, whichever comes first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/05/lateshift.png" alt="Late Shift Promo Still" />This evening, Conan O’Brien starts his
new job as host of “The Tonight Show”. The late night host enters the 11:30
arena with much fanfare and only a tad bit of drama. His predecessor, Jay
Leno, will now be his lead-in at 10:00 this fall; his critics don’t believe
his brand of humor is accessible to the middle of the country, and on top of
that he has the weight of one of the most revered jobs in television resting
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>But whatever struggles he may be having, whatever growing pains may be
occurring in the late night landscape, it cannot be compared to the mess that
occured the last time there was a transition in this space almost tow decades
ago. That affair is best illustrated in the 1996 HBO Original Movie <em>The Late
Shift</em>.</p>

<p>Directed by the actress Betty Thomas, <em>The Late Shift</em> is many things all at
once. It is a backstage opera, a comedy about comedy, a biopic and a winding
espionage-tinged drama. The two leads, Daniel Roebuck as Jay Leno and John
Michael Higgins as David Letterman, embrace their roles with only a hint of
impersonation, fulfilling the recognizable look and feel of the nationally
recognized artists while connecting to the emotional roots of each. It is
burlesque, it is revealing, and it is damn funny stuff.</p>

<p>The story centers around Johnny Carson’s moving on to greener pastures without
ever naming a replacement for his most sought after job in television. What
took place in the aftermath was a whirlwind of negotiations and heartbreak
between the network, Leno, Letterman and seemingly anyone close to either
party. Mr. Leno had proven himself a worthy stand-in for the aging Carson on
air, while Mr. Letterman had given over a decade of his life to NBC, not a
small price to pay in hopes of one day sitting in the same chair as Steve
Allen, Jack Paar and of course, Johnny. But the intrigue and backstabbing of
the film is not what interests us here. No, it is the almighty power of
television that makes the story so compelling.</p>

<p>In the film, television is something worth fighting for. Both a barometer and
a compass for American social mores, television helps bring the nation
together under one flag, under one host it seems. And so now we find ourselves
in the waning days of the medium. With the growing juggernaut that is
internet-based content, the idea that nearly any flat surface can instantly be
updated with original programming, television is fighting for it’s life. This
has happened before with the advent of VHS, the rental model, DVR and the
like, but the one constant has always been the daily commentary provided by
shows like “The Tonight Show”. It has weathered storms before now Conan will
have to lead it through the muck to come.</p>

<p>If you haven’t seen <em>The Late Shift you really should give it a spin. It will
make you miss the 1990s and wonder what the world would be like with Letterman
on NBC every night. For my money the world would be a whole lot funnier, but
that’s just me. Maybe in a few years, we’ll see the battle that went on to get
Conan to the top. For now, The Late Shift</em> is a great watch at this major
juncture in television history.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/05/dragmetohell031209.jpg" alt="dragmetohell031209.jpg.jpeg" />The opening sequence of Sam
Raimi’s <em>Drag Me to Hell</em> literally smacks you in the face with the director’s
penchant for the fantastically disgusting and spiritually perverse. For Raimi
fans relegated to watching <em>Spider-Man</em> films for the better part of this
decade, this ghastly bludgeoning is not only a treat, it’s the point. Above
all else, <em>Drag Me</em> is a vehicle for the director to flex his horror muscle,
and oh what a muscle it is.</p>

<p>The story here is pretty thin. After Christine Brown, a wholesome, farm-bred
loan officer played by Alison Lohman, refuses an extension on an elderly gypsy
woman’s mortgage, the delinquent client curses our young heroine. From there,
Christine is tormented by an evil spirit which will supposedly, you guessed
it, drag her to hell in three days. She meets a fortune teller, obviously, who
helps her along until he has to call on the services of an even more powerful
mystic. Plot is not this film’s strong suit; we’re talking boiler plate
supernatural scary stuff here. Believe it or not, that’s okay, in fact, I
prefer it.</p>

<p>In recent years, the American horror space has grown rather stale. If it’s not
another glammed up Japanese import, a pulverizing ninety-odd minutes of
torture porn, or a franchise reboot that no one asked for, it probably hasn’t
made it’s way to the mainstream in the past few years. An important
contributor to the horror revolution that took place here in the 1980s, Mr.
Raimi appears to have taken note of the dearth of creativity in his beloved
genre. The skeleton of a plot in _Drag Me to Hell _affords him the leg room to
build gloriously bloody sequences.</p>

<p>Mr. Raimi is taking us to school, showing us how to make a frightening piece
with the most basic of tools at his disposal. Sure, there are a plenty of
digital effects in the film, but rarely are they they the centerpiece of any
one scene. Instead, gory makeup, well-paced editing and ephemeral sound
effects are used to keep the audience on its toes. On display are some of the
oldest tricks in the book, just executed masterfully.</p>

<p><em>Drag Me to Hell</em> is a great ride that must be experienced in the theater.
Aurally, this film is beyond compare, so get the wax out of your ears and
listen up. Sam Raimi has crafted a cinematic tour-de-force that keeps you
laughing while turning your insides out. Don’t miss out on all of the slimy,
mucusy fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/05/sam-worthington-and-christian-bale-terminator-
salvation-2jpg.jpeg" alt="Terminator Salvation Still" />If you have never seen another <em>Terminator</em> film, the
franchise’s latest installment, <em>Terminator Salvation</em>, will be utterly
baffling to you. The good news is that if you’re a fanboy well-versed in the
series’ robotic lore, you’ll leave the theater just as confused and
dissatisified as all the noobs. In other words, it is an equal opportunity
snoozer replete with lumbering action sequences, misplaced character
development and an unrealized love subplot. Ahhh, summer.</p>

<p>The film opens in a jail cell in 2003 as Marcus Wright, played by a dialect-
confused Sam Worthington, signs his body over to Cyberdyne systems before his
lethal injection. Flash forward a decade and a half and we find the world in
ruins after the internet-induced nuclear holocaust we know of from the
previous film, <em>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</em>. Whatever humans are left
spend their time fighting robots, which are just angry, steely machines; not
quite the androids we have come to know over the years. John Connor, whose
performance is phoned in by a grizzled Christian Bale, now holds some form of
prophetic role in the world as a radio preacher.</p>

<p>Anyway, Connor goes on a mission that ends in stuff getting blow’d up, awaking
the now robotic Marcus in a goofy Golem/Frankenstein homage. After some more
robot action and the appearance of the requisite babe (who is tough enough to
fly a fighter jet yet still needs a man/machine to protect her from rape-
hungry miscreants), we learn that Kyle Reese, who is actually John Connor’s
father, has been taken to Skynet’s headquarters. As the resistance is planning
an attack, Reese is sure to die at the hands of either robot or human, unless
John Connor and his android buddy have anything to say about it. Campy schlock
ensues.</p>

<p>The question shouldn’t be “where does this film go wrong?” as much as it
should be “where does it go right?”. I’ll offer up the one highlight as Anton
Yelchin’s performance as Kyle Reese. Just as Ewan McGregor channeled a young
Alec Guiness to play Obi-Wan Kenobi, so too does Mr. Yelchin embody a young
Michael Biehn who created the role 25 years ago. Adding some lovable humor to
this year’s <em>Star Trek</em> and now giving us the only character worth watching in
<em>Salvation</em>, this is turning out to be the summer of Yelchin, and let’s hope
there are many more to come.</p>

<p>Other than that, the film is a mess. The action sequences are yawn-able, the
motivations of neither the machines nor the humans make any no sense, and
worst of all, we are offered no insight into John Connor’s destiny. As the
lore goes, he is the key to ending the war with the machines, which he already
did, preemptively, in the second film. We last saw him stuck in a bunker at
the end of the third film, yet this film completely skips what happens after
that. How does he get out and rise up through the ranks? Why do people think
he is a prophet? Did he tell them? No answers are offered here, making this
feel more like mid-season filler for a television show rather than the
gratification we expect from a season finale.</p>

<p>McG, the film’s director, is someone I had hoped would have graduated from a
successful run as an adolescent filmmaker. Unfortunately, his attempts at
growing up falter on every front. This film tries to show us a gritty future,
but the picture is so incredibly clean that this barely comes off. It feels
like an effected car commercial instead of a bleak view of the future. On top
of that, save for Mr. Yelchin, no one offers up a memorable performance,
leading me to believe that McG has incredibly low expectations of his actors.
He gets work because he knows how to blow stuff up, but even the action is
tired. Spatially almost nothing makes sense and there are no intense moments.
I kept thinking of how great it was in the original film when the T-800 busts
into the police station to get Sarah Connor. That scene, pretty bare bones
special effects wise, works because by that point the audience is braced and
excited for the ensuing gun battle. No scene is ever to pulse pounding in this
film. I’m not sure that McG will ever get better, so maybe the franchise
should find someone else.</p>

<p>This is the first film not to feature Arnold Schwazzenegger, at least not in
the flesh. A more important absence here, however, is James Cameron, whose
name doesn’t appear in the credits at all, a Terminator first. This seems
fitting as this is the least interesting and least innovative film of the
bunch. <em>Rise of the Machines</em> at least offered up a wicked car chase. It is
nice to see this beloved and respected story continue, but if this is
direction things are going, then we have to say “Hasta La Vista, Baby”.</p>

<p>This time of year, I get a handful of e-mails from recent college graduates asking for jobs and advice about getting started in the film business. I always love responding to all of them. As a blogger, obviously I love it when people listen to my opinions. Naturally, I tend to repeat myself a lot, so I started thinking , why not just pile all of that advice into a single post that I can reference when people have questions. This advice isn’t limited just to college grads or even the younger set. If you’re in the mood for a career change there might be some tidbits you can use in here. So clean out those ears and listen up, here is the candler’s guide to starting out in the film industry.</p>

<h2 id="decide-where-you-want-to-live">1. Decide Where You Want to Live</h2>

<p>The first question I ask every college graduate is “Where do you want to live?”. Some say “Wherever I can get a job” and I immediately let them know that this is the wrong answer. Economic meltdown notwithstanding, the only people who get jobs that will facilitate moving a new hire to a different city are executives, maybe lawyers or people with M.B.A.s. So you have to pick where you’ll be first and then it will get much easier to start looking for work.</p>

<p>For the film industry, the two main centers are New York and Los Angeles, though this is by no means your only option. Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Shreveport, and Vancouver are just a few of the other cities in North America with established or burgeoning film communities. It is an industry that is doing extremely well given the economic climate, so we are actually seeing more work pop up in a variety of places, especially in cities and states that don’t have a strong fim business yet.</p>

<p>Once you pick the place you want to be, then you can come up with your plan of how to get there. This will require pounding the pavement and getting yourself a bit uncomfortable for a bit. All of us, and I really mean all of us, had to stay on a friends couch until we found a job or apartment. Wherever you end up, it will be a process to get yourself set up. Don’t worry, it gets better in time.</p>

<h2 id="choose-a-skill-and-perfect-it">2. Choose a Skill and Perfect It</h2>

<p>This may seem obvious, but a lot of film schools in the U.S. teach you the basics of many different fields instead of forcing you to master one. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s great to have a wide swath of knowledge as you start out in the world. Unfortunately, no one is hiring a writer/director/shooter/editor just out of school. If you want to make your own movies, then you simply have to go ahead and make your own movies. If you want to find a job within the film industry you will have to hone your knowledge in on one specific aspect of the biz.</p>

<p>There are so many jobs to fill on any one movie that it can be daunting to try to pick one area of expertise. Consider your long-term and short-term goals. Most likely, the short term goal is to make enough money to live, preferably even more so you can support your personal films. The thing is, any job in the world can fulfill that goal. Your long term goals are what will help guide you into your early niche.</p>

<p>For example, someone who wants to be a cinematographer might try to find jobs on film sets in the camera department in hopes of beefing up their resumé, meeting established contacts, and getting some face time with high end camera gear. What steps do you need to take to get a job in the camera department? Maybe you read camera manuals, subscribe to trade magazines, begin putting a reel together, and so one. Now you have three short-term goals that you can accomplish to start perfecting your skill.</p>

<h2 id="spend-both-your-time-and-money-wisely">3. Spend Both Your Time and Money Wisely</h2>

<p>Another very common thing that recent grads will do is buy that camera or computer that they think will get them on their way. It’s true, you need these tools to get work, but you have to consider the feasibility of investing that much of your own money into gear. This is just like any other business, you’ll need to make enough money back from that purchase for it to be worth it. The same goes for training programs or seminars. If it’s worth it, go for it, just do enough research to be informed.</p>

<p>Here’s an example concerning your time. Apple offers certification in Final Cut Pro. The courses offer a great deal of information covering the entire breadth of the application. The tradeoff is that the program will take up a great deal of your time and costs a hefty chunk of money. I know plenty of people who have not taken these courses and get tons of Final Cut work. The certification is absolutely worth it for some people, but it is not necessarily required for everyone. No degree, course, computer or camera is going to guaruntee you work. It will always come down to your skill and tenacity.</p>

<h2 id="continuously-update-your-resume">4. Continuously Update Your Resume</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/jonathan-poritsky-resume.png"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/jonathan-poritsky-resume-214x300.png" alt="Click to Enlarge" title="" align="left" /></a>This really only applies to freelancers, but in the film world you may find yourself freelancing a great deal at the beginning. There are many resources for writing a successful resumé in general, however there is some nuance for someone seeking film work. We can use mine as an example. (Click that graphic to the right. It hasn’t been updated in awhile…I’m not following my own rules!)</p>

<p>Most of it is familiar to any resumé: work, education, references. The one tweak is that I’ve divided my experience into “Film and Video Production Experience” and “Work Experience”. The difference is that one header is reserved for freelance work while the other holds my full-time work. It’s important to have both represented as they complement each other nicely. People hiring freelancers like to know that this is a person who can hold it together in a sustained environment while full-time employers are impressed that you can bounce from gig to gig easily.</p>

<p>Also, roll your freelancing work. When I first started out, everything under the first experience header was student work I did in college. As I got more pro experience, I would fill the new work to the top and roll the old stuff to the bottom. You may need to do this quite often depending on how much work you get. Hopefully you’ll have to change it often!</p>

<p>The other rule of thumb is to never underestimate your worth on any given job. The topmost freelance gig on my resumé is Assistant Editor for NASCAR in Primetime Opening Sequence, ABC Sports. Sounds semi-impressive, at the very least legit, right? In real life, it entailed about 3 days of work loading tapes for a 30 second sequence, yet it still takes up a full line, roughly 1/12 of the page. The point is that you need to focus in on the real work experience that you have, even if it doesn’t seem all that exciting when you’re doing it.</p>

<h2 id="keep-your-feet-on-the-ground-and-have-some-fun">5. Keep Your Feet on the Ground and Have Some Fun</h2>

<p>There is no question, the movie business is a very fun business to be in. You may find yourself working in exotic locations with celebrities and sometimes personal heroes. It is important to remember that it is very easy to get caught up in all the fun of it sometimes. People will tell you all kinds of stories. “I made my first film by maxing out all of my credit cards” is a classic legend that goes around. Yeah, that’s one way to get your work done, but there are always cheaper and better paths for you to choose.</p>

<p>Moreso than that, since there is that mystique surrounding moviemaking, many people are drawn into it and taken advantage of at the beginning. Do not fall into that trap. You have worked hard to attain the knowledge you have and you are skilled enough that it’s worth paying for. Many people get attached to films for very little or no money just for the fun of it, but you still have to pay rent and stuff.</p>

<p>That being said, a little bit of pro bono work in exchange for contacts and experience can go a long way. You simply have to figure out how it fits into your life. If you can swing a few weeks of no pay to learn something that will really help you out with your long term goals, then it is absolutely worth it. You just don’t want to find yourself hurting because you wanted to be on the same set as a D-list horror actor, you geek.</p>

<p>Alright, that was a whole lot of information thrown at you at once. The truth, obviously, is that there is no one right anwer. The film and video industry is incredibly fun and diverse. Have fun with it. It can take you to exoctic places and there is a great deal of room for growth. You can live the dream: start on the bottom and make your way to the top. You can also start on the bottom and work your way up to a nice living. Maybe start at the top and then even out somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>These are just some tips to help you along the way. I’ve learned this all just from experience over the years and I am still learning more every day. Please add any helpful tips, or criticisms of my writing if you prefer, in the comments. The candler is a place for filmmakers and film lovers to come together and undertand our business, our medium, and our passions better. Best of luck to all of you. Now quit reading this and go out and make some movie magic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The candler blog is based in New York City and is still in it’s first year, so when I went to the airport to buy my ticket to the French Riviera but could only hand them the lint in my pockets, I was rebuffed and sent back to my Manhattan abode. So yeah, I’m not at Cannes reporting on the biggest film news in the world, but we certainly can get some work done at a safe distance, no? Let’s gather some of the noise and make a little story about it. With me? Here goes…</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.offoffoff.com/film/2004/images/fiveobstructions.jpg" /></p>

<p>Last week, the latest film from the ineffable Lars Von Trier, <em>Antichrist</em>, screened at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, apparently causing the international film community to synchronously blush and squirm on the edge their seats. The internets are aflutter with talk about how great/sexy/violent/evil/awful/awesome the movie is. Is anyone surprised that Mr. Von Trier is once again a polarizing figure in cinema? What were you expecting?</p>

<p>An original member of the Scandinavian Dogme 95 collective, Lars Von Trier is one of the group’s most illustrious ex-pats. He made a real impact in the U.S. with his video musical <em>Dancer in the Dark</em>, starring Björk and Catherine Deneuve. After recieving  flack for making a film critiquing North American lifestyles (<em>Dancer</em> takes place in Canada) without ever having visited the continent, the director responded defiantly with <em>Dogville</em>, a grandiose experiment set in 1930s America. For some reason, every time you come close to pinpointing exactly what kind of filmmaker Mr. Von Trier is, he eludes you, sidestepping any label and making something completely unexpected.</p>

<p>I don’t want to talk about his newest film or the headier work mentioned above. I want to talk about Lars Von Trier, the unabashed trickster.</p>

<p>For 2006’s <em>The Boss of it All</em>, the acclaimed director utilized a system dubbed “Automavision”. Basically, he shot the film only from wider angles, or all establishing shots, and allowed a computer randomly tilt, pan, or zoom. Watching the film, you would never know this. It feels wholly organic, intentional. In fact, for Mr. Von Trier, it seems almost tame. Of course, behind the curtain the Danish cinéaste had a pile of tricks he was working with.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/23boss600a.jpg" title="Boss Of It All Still" /></p>

<p>The plot is endearing and appropriate for such a ludicrous filmmaking method. Kristoffer is a struggling actor who is hired for a job at an IT company that he doesn’t quite understand. He quickly learns that Ravn is the company’s CEO, but has been pretending that he is just a manager answering to a higher power, the elusive boss of  it all who no one has ever met. By acting like an underling to the non-existent boss, Ravn is absolved of any real responsibility, particularly when it comes to firing people. He can just blame it on the the boss of it all, whom Kristoffer has been hired to play for the purposes of merger negotiations with an Icelandic company.</p>

<p>The scope of the story is small but the laughs are big and the form is unique. The Automavision process seemingly enhances the story more than detracting from it but questions abound. How much control does the computer really have? Why would Lars Von Trier relinquish so much control? What’s the point of reinventing the wheel here anyway? After leaving the Dogme 95 movement behind, Mr. Von Trier has gone out of his way to break all of the rules of that group’s <a href="http://cinetext.philo.at/reports/dogme_ct.html">“Vow of Chastity”</a>. Besides breaking the specific codes of conduct with <em>The Boss of It All</em>, he has left the ideals of Dogme completely in the dust. Giving control over to a machine, he is simultaneously removing himself as creative controller and, amazingly, further pressing his status as provocateur by drawing attention to his shrunken role.</p>

<p>This is Trier the trickster. By defying our best attmepts to define him, he is toying with our expectations not only of the director but of the cinema itself. So bring on Antichrist, Lars. We may not be ready to watch it, but it seems that every time you pick up a camera we are left reconsidering the purposes of filmmaking. For that, we thank you. It is this boldness, this artistry, this prickishness that keeps us moving forward.</p>

<p>For a look at where he’ll take us next, check out this preview of <em>Antichrist</em>.</p>

7">Angelika Film Center</a> On the surface, Soho’s Angelika Film Center’s great location, phenomenal
programming, delectable café and the weight of a national theater alliance to
throw behind riskier fare make it seem like the perfect art house cinema.
Unfortunately, the auditoriums in this Manhattan mainstay are too close to the
earth’s core to allow for a decent screening. Tucked away dangerously close to
the nearby subway stop, you’ll have to wait for a transit strike if you want
to watch a film uninterrupted.</p>

<p>When you walk up to the box office of the Angelika, it doesn’t take long for
the building to enchant you. Perched on a massive corner at Houston and Mercer
streets, the hand changed “Now Playing” sign evokes a simpler time in cinema,
wholly analog in nature. An eave over the box office has art deco inspired
lettering emblazoned on it, with stairs leading up into the ticketing
vestibule; it is like walking up a tongue into a mouth, a warm place to rest.</p>

<p>The entire first floor boast’s one of Lower Manhattan’s most capacious cafés.
Rarely overcrowded, it is a great place to sit and get some work done, chow
down on a pastry and suck back a cup o’ joe. Adding to the fun, it is
unquestionably a cinema cafe, with posters and postcards littering the tables
and walls. It never stoops to the level of a lobby. The movement to add
legitimate café space into theaters is ingenious, this is a haven for
cinéfiles and maker’s alike.</p>

<p>But one can only tarry upstairs for so long. After all, this is a theater as
well, and you probably paid to see a show. Once your ticket is snuffed out by
the usher, the descent into New York’s bowels begins via escalator; stairs for
adventure seekers. Don’t bother silencing your mobile, there’s no service
where you’re going. Okay, this is an exaggeration. The auditoriums are
probably a story and a half, maybe two stories, below street level. Other
theaters go much lower, but none have to compete with the MTA as the Angelika
does.</p>

<p>Looking past the subterranean handicap, the auditoriums themselves are subpar.
The screens are small and too high up, the projectors too far away. The rooms
are long and narrow, trying to fit more seats “vertically”, but the picture
quality must suffer as a tradeoff. When you can’t hear the train coming by
every twenty minutes, you can hear films in the auditoriums next door if stuff
is getting blow’d up in them.</p>

<p>Now, I will say that the Angelika is in the business of doing the impossible,
that being bringing independent cinema of the world to the masses. It is a
very tough business and they do an incredible job of programming for an
increasingly diverse audience. The Angelika always has provocative new work
showing. At time of writing, I can tell you I want to see everything they have
showing right now. In a way, they have cornered the market on independent
fare. They’re not the only art house in the city, but they are one of the
busiest; the breadth of their offerings is remarkable.</p>

<p>So you have a choice to make: see groundbreaking new work from an
international library in a subpar environment or don’t. Personally, I will
always go with the former. Sometimes, what you crave is only at the Angelika,
and you should absolutely go see it. We have been spoiled in recent years. AMC
in particular, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/04/22/review-amc-loews-lincoln-
square-nyc/">as mentioned in a previous
article</a>, has made a very strong push to entice audiences with impeccable
aural and visual experiences. Believe it or not, this is a relatively young
movement. Before we cared so much about screening quality we would just go to
the movies, and get lost in the world of film, however broken or degraded our
surrounding may be. If it is great cinema you seek, then the Angelika is
perfect, maybe even magical.</p>

<p>STAND CLEAR THE CLOSING DOOR!!! (naw, I kid)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.filmofilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/angels-and-demons-
113_m.jpg" alt="" />If you were wondering how oscar winning director Ron Howard spends
his weekends, you will find the answer in his latest film, <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em>,
which appears to have been conceived and produced in his spare time. Cobbled
together from a thin plot by pulp sensationalist Dan Brown’s novel of the same
name, the story follows Harvard symbologist (semiologist, no?) Robert Langdon
on a winding mystery through the annals of Vatican history. While the material
is fascinating, the film suffers mostly from whiplash, trying desperately to
keep your attention on the winding streets of Rome but forgetting to build any
kind of relationship with the players involved.</p>

<p>After the kidnapping of the four cardinals favored to replace the recently
deceased pope, Mr. Langdon, played by an unusually stolid Tom Hanks, is called
to the Vatican to consult for the Church, who believes the Illuminati, a cabal
of scientists and scholars supposedly killed off in the 17th century, have
returned for vengeance. Upon arrival, he meets Vittoria Vetra, a sultry
physicist thesped by the wondrous Ayelet Zurer. She was called in when
antimatter stolen from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva turns up
hidden somewhere in Vatican City. Suspended between two magnets in a battery
powered canister, the mysterious antimatter will ignite should it lose power,
which will happen at the convenient stroke of midnight.</p>

<p>All characters in place, Langdon immediately bites on one of the clues offered
up by the kidnapper/terrorist and off we go. Bouncing around from church to
church with brief spates in the Vatican archives, the film gets old very fast.
Much of this has to do with the character of Robert Langdon, a milquetoast
academic who never even surrenders to the gods of logic, instead buying into
anti-Christian dogma religiously, ironically. He has no skin in the game, to
put it more bluntly. There are lives on the line so he must participate, but
since he has no reveal, no emotional discord to be resolved, he becomes less
of a protagonist and more a vehicle to get us from point to point, murder to
murder, and to Mr. Brown’s semiotic agenda.</p>

<p>Along the way we meet Patrick McKenna, the emotinally invested Camerlengo
charged with administering the Pope’s office until a new one is elected.
Filling the sub-papal shoes is Ewan McGregor, this time sporting an Irish
accent and an innocent sneer to boot. His foil is the aging Cardinal Strauss,
who is charged with leading the conclave to elect the new pope. Strauss,
played with dependable efficacy by Armin Mueller-Stahl, represents the
unbending faith of the deeply codified organization, while McKenna is
something of a wide-eyed revolutionary, seemingly rewriting church law in an
effort to save the lives of both the endangered priests and the public at
large. While both are fine actors in their own regard, neither McGregor nor
Mueller-Stahl is given a hook on which to hang a performance, a running theme
in this movie.</p>

<p>The film isn’t without its high points, particularly at the Large Hadron
Collider at the beginning. Geeks around the world will be impressed by the
footage taken from within the actual particle accelerator. The filmmakers go
above and beyond to make the process of smashing protons together, which is
yet to be tested at CERN’s massive Swiss facility, both scientifically
plausible and visually exhillerating. Sadly, the real science ends once the
antimatter is stolen. For the duration of the film, it is nothing more than a
huge bomb. The truth is that while we have no idea what would happen if
antimatter and matter came in contact with one another, the general consensus
is that it would be freaking scary, like destroy the universe scary. It is not
this scientific inaccuracy that is so annoying but the unwillingness to
explore this most interesting boundary of both science and religion.</p>

<p>In the end, this is a mystery with religious iconography as an overarching
MacGuffin. So much time is spent orienting the audience that there is hardly
any chance to slow down and make sense of the dastardly plot. Writers David
Koepp and Akiva Goldsman are no slouches, but they have composed a wooden
script this time out. Perhaps they are not to blame; maybe not Ron Howard
either. Dan Brown’s novels are unabashed pulp shlock while these film
adaptations are approached with misguided reverence for the originals. Perhaps
the further from Mr. Brown these stories get, and they are phenomenal tales,
the better they will be. We’ll just have to wait and see when his next novel,
The Lost Symbol, slated for the supposed largest first printing in Random
House history, hits shelves this fall and inevitably, theaters in a few years.</p>
