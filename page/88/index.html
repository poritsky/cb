  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was a bit of whirlwind, even though I spent most of the day on my
ass in the same theater. It just so happened that all the films I wanted to
see were at the same venue. Really, I mean it, I’m not just lazy. It started
out with a little filmmaker coffee time over at the Oklahoma City Museum of
Art. It is nice when everyone comes together for a bit of starbucks and
biscuits in the morning. Makers, fans, critics and friends all hung out, some
tooling around on MacBook Airs that are provided in the lounge. I, course,
just slapped my giant 17” MBP next to those lithe little machines and went to
town.</p>

<p>By days end I managed to see 3 features: <em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/13/deadcenter-review-official-
rejection/">Official
Rejection</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/13/deadcenter-review-sweethearts-of-
the-prison-rodeo/">Sweethearts of the Prison
Rodeo</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/13
/deadcenter-review-weather-girl/">Weather Girl</a></em>. All attracted nice sized crowds and were
recieved quite positively by the festival audience. As I settled into the 8:00
screening of Weather Girl, I finally realized that I hadn’t eaten all day.
More than anything, I feared my critical rendencies being affected by the
hunger pangs that would taunt me throughout. As you could guess, I was fine
and ended up going to an Italian joint named Flip’s on the way back to the
house.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about Flip’s. The food was okay, and the Oklahoma Belgian-
style beer I had was delicious, but the real charm was the music. I swear, for
the entire time I was there, they must have been playing the theme song from
<em>King of the Hill</em> on loop. It was just plain awesome. Filmmaker coffee this
morning was pretty nice. I got to talk to some filmmakers about the reviews
I’ve given them, but more on that later. Right now I’ve got to head to another
feature doc, <em>Our Spirits Don’t Speak English: Indian Boarding School</em>. I’m
not sure what I’ll be seeing after that, but check back soon for the liveblog
where I’ll keep you up to date.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of how intense filmmaker coffee can get in the morning. And
yes, I did choose a pic that made everyone look bad on purpose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/img_8366.jpg" alt="Weather Girl Still" />Blayne Weaver’s second feature, <em>Weather
Girl</em>, is a predictable love triangle that dabbles in a grab bag of
independent filmmaking clichés that we, as a viewership, are so over. So what?
It made me and the entire audience laugh. Here at the candler blog I don’t
usually let films off the hook so easily, so how could I say that <em>Weather
Girl</em> gets a pass because it made me laugh? The film is tight and the laughs
are genuine in ways that other films, many many other films, aren’t.</p>

<p>The film follows “sassy” weather girl Sylvia after an on air <em>Network</em>
inspired freakout leaves her jobless, homeless and manless. She moves in with
her slacker brother and his cute-in-a-dirty-kinda-way philosophy major
neighbor. Hmmmmm, I wonder if she’ll find love under these wacky conditions?
Wait! Maybe she’ll not only find love, but she’ll find herself while searching
for it. It is formulaic to say the least, but like I said, who cares?</p>

<p>Over the years, festival films have become the next best thing for an audience
always on the prowl for new surprises. I think we can look at them a bit
differently. Mr. Weaver’s film is an excellent exercise in comedic timing, and
I believe we will see wonderful things from him in the future. For my money,
he should direct a film that someone else wrote as that seems where his
strengths lie, but I’m just a critic. What do I know?</p>

<p>We get nice performances from Tricia O’Kelley, Patrick J. Adams, and Ryan
Devlin, as well a gloriously smarmy Mark Harmon. My personal favorite perf
comes from <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s</em> Kaitlin Olson. She doesn’t
get that much screen time, but when she does, she shines. I would also like to
point out that, especially in the scenes that take place on the morning news
show, editing plays an enormous role in the comedic tension that is built
throughout the film. A huge pat on the back goes to editor Abe Levy who cut
those laughs into shape.</p>

<p>Over the years, the rom-com has become something of an art form. Hitting the
right emotional beats for a crowd that doesn’t want to invest too much of
themselves in a story is not an easy task, but <em>Weather Girl</em> seems to
accomplish this. The audience stuck with it and had some great laughs along
the way. What more could they really ask for? A better movie? Yeah, get on
that Mr. Weaver. What’s next?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/screens_feature15-4.jpg" alt="Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo Still" />The fact that Bradley
Beesley’s <em>Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo</em> is something of a festival darling
here in Oklahoma City is not a surprise by any measure. It is a rock solid
documentary not only with local interest, but it is rousing people to bring
about change, sort of.</p>

<p>The film follows female inmates at the Eddie Warrior Correctional Center in
Taft, Oklahoma as they prepare for the second prison rodeo that women have
been invited to. The event is a state tradition first instituted in 1940 and
has attracted large crowds over the years, but only to watch the men. Mr.
Beesley’s film has a lot of potential for volatility. After all, it is the
story of hardened criminals being thrown in front of riled up cattle for the
enjoyment of the masses. What transpires throughout the runtime of the piece
is so counfounding, so disturbing, and so beautiful that one can’t help but be
moved by this odd and untold story.</p>

<p>You need some backstory, which the film provides, to understand what makes the
film so dog gone wonderful. Oklahoma has more women incarcerated per capita
than any other state in the U.S. Approximately 80% of them are mothers and the
majority of them are in there for methamphetamine charges. Here in Oklahoma,
meth is widely available and probably the biggest social problem Okies have to
deal with. When the drug stastistic comes out on screen, the crowd I was with
didn’t budge, wasn’t surprised. It is a fact of life out here.</p>

<p>So we get to know some of these women who join the rodeo in an effort to get
outside of the gray wals they call home; to be a part of a team and find the
personal streghth they need to make it in the world once their sentence ends.
It is a moving tale, but Mr. Beesley doesn’t spoon feed us anything. As an
audience, we are forced to make certain choices about the characters and the
film as a whole which speak volumes about our own personal values. Is it right
to watch men and women be gored by animals, or is it alright for the animals?
Are we okay to believe that murderers should be given a pulpit in cinema? Can
we look the victims’ families in the eyes and say “I think Danny Liles
deserves a second chance because I saw a movie about him?” Should we be given
the chance?</p>

<p>These questions and more are not present in the world of <em>Sweethearts of the
Prison Rodeo</em>, and yet they are inescapable. This is why it is such a
successful film. At points, there wasn’t a dry eye in the room watching this
movie, and this is among a crowd who has the power to change the bleak state
of things in Oklahoma. The social problems in the state (as in any state,
don’t get me wrong) could fill a stack of papers a mile high, and female
incarceration and meth use are only the result of such problems, not the
cause. People need to get organized, get educated, and get together, but more
than that they need to get motivated to move the earth here. I believe they
can do it, and I believe that Mr. Beesley’s film will help push them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.mcnblogs.com/thehotblog/archives/rejection.jpg" alt="" />I feel inclined
to like Paul Osborne’s <em>Official Rejection</em>, but not because it is a good
film. As a film critic, I am drawn to any movie whose premise is that we
(filmmakers, critics, distributors, audience members, etc.) are all complicit
in a broken system. The film, which follows a number of filmmakers around the
festival circuit during the course of a year, is seemingly propagandizing the
concept that big name festivals are a scourge on independent filmmaking. They
take your hopes and dreams and money and make you feel like shit when they
reject you without cause or justifiation.</p>

<p>So yes, I liked it, because its heart. Mr. Osborne and his dedicated team
traverse the North American festival wasteland in search of fame and fortune,
but moreso recognition of any sort. A key player here is director Scott Storm,
whose film, <em> Ten ‘Til Noon</em>, is the main focus of the festival hopping. (Paul
Osborne also wrote that film) Broken up into segments which parallel the
process of distributing a film via the festival pipe, <em>Official Rejection</em> is
tight, funny and generally easy on the eyes. The film is mostly successful as
an educational tool for young filmmakers. It demystifies many of the paradigms
that they may think they understand, particularly the idea that a screening at
a festival is the first step to getting noticed, getting riches, getting
famous, etc.</p>

<p>Also, the filmmakers call attention to the importance of the camaraderie that
has become the lifeblood of many festivals. When you throw a bunch of
creatives into the same volatile foxhole, you are bound to hit on something
exciting, something electric. New relationships are forged, new perspectives
are discovered, and people come together in ways that they may never have done
under other circumstances.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the film’s greatest weakness: while trying to deconstruct
the horrors of the North American film festivals, Mr. Osborne and friends
become smitten with them. Their hatred of the majors brings them even closer
to the minor festivals, though I should say that Chicago’s IndieFest gets the
rawest deal of any of them in the film. I could amend that to say that feature
director Blayne Weaver gets the rawest deal, but you’ll have to see the film
to understand that reference. Nevertheless, no matter how much the filmmakers
tell us that the festival system is broken, they keep returning to it as the
same solution.</p>

<p>In my opinion (and you asked for it, that’s why you’re here), there must be a
better way to get your films out there, to reach an audience, than the same
old ways that we have relied on for decades. There is also no historical frame
of reference in this movie. It should be noted that as long as there has been
art, there have been critics; as long as there have been fests, there have
been anti-fests. This is not a new phenomenon, just one that has been
amplified by the prevalence of the equipment required to make a film. It is so
funny that the same people who wish to democratize cinema (filmmakers) will
end up getting burned by the inundation of new work being created faster,
quicker, and cheaper every single day. We want everyone to make a movie, just
not while we’re trying to sell ours.</p>

<p>All that ranting and raving aside, <em>Official Rejection</em> is a solid film that
all film enthusiasts should see. If you are not in the mood for a discussion
on the current state of cinema distribution, there is plenty for you to love
here. And if you are on the inside and you absolutely hate this film, well, at
least Paul Osborne has opened up the conversation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are so many films showing here at deadCENTER that it is impossible for
me to see everything that I want to. Yesterday I was only able to check out
two features and no shorts. If only the festival could be two weeks long so I
could see it all.</p>

<p>Anyway, most of yesterday was spent in friend’s car, searching for Route 66,
which we didn’t find. I still got a scenic tour of Oklahoma, so it wasn’t a
total loss. When we cot back to the city, I went to the Oklahoma City Bombing
Memorial. This is a beautiful memorial for this terrible act that happened on
our soil. Given that I am here to observe cinema, it is fascinating to see a
horror like this bombing being dealt with through art. The memorial is a
peaceful place. Very fitting. Pictures below.</p>

<p>[nggallery id=1]</p>

<p>But this isn’t a sightseeing tour, it’s film festival coverage. You can check
out my reviews on the films I saw yesterday, <em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/12/deadcenter-review-triangle-of-
death/">Triangle of
Death</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/12/deadcenter-review-
pearl/">Pearl</a></em>, elsewhere on the site. Afterwards I headed over to a swanky party,
much swankier than the party on Wednesday night. How swanky? A friend of mine
ordered a glass of water and it came in an 18 inch tall fluted glass. Classy?
Hells yeah it’s classy. Unfortunately, my beer only came in a 12 ounce bottle.
Bummer.</p>

<p>Today is going to be a busy slate. <em>Official Rejection</em> screening and panel is
at 2:00pm, then <em>Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo</em> followed by <em>Weather Girl</em>.
I’m hoping to bounce in and out of shorts programs in between, and my late
night screening plans are still up in the air. Live blog will start soon, keep
checking back for the latest and greatest from the center of the earth.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From here on out, when I hear the term “local film”, I will think of King
Hollis’s <em>Pearl</em>, a sweeping biopic that follows the aviation career of Pearl
Scott Carter, the youngest licensed pilot in U.S. History. The film was
financed in large part by the Chickasaw Nation and featured a crew that was
around 60% Oklahoman, which is fitting for a local hero. Last night, when the
film showed here in Oklahoma City at the deadCENTER Film Festival, the house
was packed with at least fifty people stranded outside, unable to secure
tickets for the show. Those who did make it inside were roused to standing
ovation as the credits began to roll. So what is this movie that has such an
allure here?</p>

<p>The story is very basic. Pearl is a daredevil who drives her blind father
around at the age of 11. When an unexpected visitor, pilot Wiley Post, lands
his new plane in Pearl’s backyard, she is given the chance of a lifetime to go
up in the air with him. Enchanted by this little girl’s tenacity, Wiley
suggests she learn to fly. In due time, Pearl’s father buys her a plane and
builds her a landing strip. The young prodigy begins flying in airshows and
carting businessmen across the state. However, the excitement of flying comes
at a price, and she is forced to choose between her love for aviation and need
to have a family, a life.</p>

<p>The truth is that there are many weak parts in the story. In general, the film
runs too long, bustling about from plot point to plot point without always
drawing a direct relationship between everything that is happening. Shot on
video, the movie is quite gorgeous. As a period piece, it can be difficult to
get an audience behind the harshness of the video image, but in time this
falls away, mostly due to the wonderful performances in the film. Elijah
DeJesus is great as Pearl. It is difficult to buy her aging over the years,
which is accomplished by giving her longer hair, but her stage presence more
than makes up for it. Also of note is Andrew Sensenig who plays Pearl’s
father, George Sr. Playing a blind man can be difficult, there is often an
emotional disconnect when someone is focused on not looking at anyone, but Mr.
Sensenig steps up to the plate and delivers. He almost reminds me of Tom
Hanks, but only almost. There are a number of great performances to see, but
we must move the review along.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis and his dedicated team recreated rural Oklahoma in the 1920s and
1930s to bring this tale to life. The costumes are spot on, the old town
streets are delightful to look at, and the period specific aircraft are
breathtaking. The film was shot on a modest, unreleased budget in 23 days.
During a Q &amp; A session, Mr. Hollis mentioned that all of the airborne material
was shot in a matter of 6 hours. This is impressive given the scope of the
film. It is colorful, endearing, and exciting. Most importantly in this film
is the sense of wonderment it creates, something that is often lost among
indie filmmakers. During many of the flying scene, I was sitting there wide-
eyed, gawking at the screen like a little kid.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, this is decidedly a local film. Producer David Rennke,
who is Chickasaw and plans to make many films about the Chickasaw Nation,
mentioned that they think the film has the potential to be a worldwide
success. While that may be possible, the best aspect of this film is its
ability to be a success here. Like I said before, the audience here loved it
and they need more films like this, they are aching for them. How delightful
it is to see your hometown portrayed so lovingly on screen; how fitting that a
local hero get the “hollywood” treatment, but without all the noise and fuss
of actual Hollywood coming to you. This is a key local film for Oklahomans,
and they should be proud. <em>Pearl</em> is worth checking out, that is if you find
yourself in an auditorium full of eager Okies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What can I say about <em>Triangle of Death</em> by Folleh Tamba that won’t just come
out mean and disaffected? It is a misguided documentary with no clear vision
behind where it takes the viewer, which is unfortunate because there is an
incredible amount of interesting material to work with here. Namely, the film
features on-the-ground footage in Iraq, which is fascinating to watch.
Unfortunately, it is all thrown into a mish mosh of interviews from a
predetermined list of lame questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Tamba is a marine who shot the film alongside the other members of the
Echo Company 3rd platoon of the 2nd battalion 24th Marines. His efforts are
admirable , and as I said, the footage he got over there is amazing.
Unfortunately, the film follows no clear narrative; no character relationships
are built between the audience and the men being interviewed. <em>Triangle of
Death</em> has one very specific goal, which is to glorify the work of the USMC.</p>

<p>Mr. Tamba, if you are out there listening, you have access to the most
interesting story in America right now, so please give us something more
interesting to watch. Make us really think, don’t just tell us what you think.
The film is littered with facts when all we needed was a single emotional
investment in any one of the Marines featured in the film. Also, you pull the
film in so many directions (anti-journalism, anti-anti-war, soldier stories,
gory non-sequiturs, etc.) that we are never given the time to focus on one
interesting facet of the abstraction that is war. It’s a shame, again, because
there is so much to work with.</p>
