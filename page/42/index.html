<p>Shawn made the leap to full time writer well after most everyone had agreed no one could make a living publishing their own Web site anymore. When he talks about blogging, you should probably listen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gabe over at Macdrifter posted two incredibly useful posts with suggestions to make Sublime Text 2 a more writer-friendly app:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/sublime-text-for-writing/">Sublime Text for Writing</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I got all of his suggestions up and running without taking my hands off of the keyboard. In fact I wrote this post without taking my hands off the keyboard thanks in part to Dr. Drang’s recent TextExpander goodness, “<a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/07/markdown-reference-links-from-safari-tabs/">Markdown reference links from safari tabs</a>.”</p>

<p>The more I play with it, the more Sublime Text 2 seems like it will become my go-to text editor. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4 id="in-which-i-write-a-blog-post-about-packing-my-apartment-with-omnifocus-instead-of-actually-packing-my-apartment">In Which I Write A Blog Post About Packing My Apartment with OmniFocus Instead of Actually Packing My Apartment</h4>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/omnipack-head.jpg" title="OmniFocus Packing Workflow" /></p>

<p>Moving sucks, but we all have to do it at some point. As you <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/07/06/goodbye-new-york/">may have heard</a>, I’m moving to Texas soon. Which means about a decade’s worth of detritus needs to be packed or purged. And well, I’m not so good at getting rid of stuff. But I’m not moving across town anymore; I need to go through every corner of my apartment and weed out the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>In an effort to get myself to finally dive into the more disorganized nooks of my place, I turned to OmniFocus, the GTD app I’ve had an on-again, off-again relationship with for some three years.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> My initial plan was to pack things up by type, as in, “Today, I shall pack books. Tomorrow I shall pack magazines,” and so on. The trouble is that I’ve got stuff just about everywhere. <em>Most</em> of the books live on bookshelves, but certainly not all of them. There are probably DVDs in the couch cushions. And clothes? You don’t want to know.</p>

<p>So then I decided I should work on one room at a time, but that got convoluted fast as well. After all, each room has its own unique spaces that require a different set of parameters. For example, clearing the bookshelf basically gets me into the same problem as before, because I get the urge to pack <em>all</em> the books in the apartment. Plus, it takes so long to pack a room that I would never feel a sense of accomplishment<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> until the whole room was done.</p>

<p>So finally I hatched a little method that has so far worked, so I decided to expand it out to the whole apartment and see if I can start checking items off left and right. In short, each room in my apartment is a folder in OmniFocus, and each area in each room is a project. Then I get more granular by making each aspect of each area an action. Let me show it to you before I go into any more detail.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/omnipack-1.jpg" title="OmniFocus Packing 1" /></p>

<p>In the office (where I was supposed to be cleaning before I went off on this tear) I broke the room up into seven distinct areas, starting with my desk. My desk, in turn, has five basic areas that need cleaning, the surface and four overloaded drawers. Of course, I can make things a bit easier by focusing only on the desk in OmniFocus.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/omnipack-2.jpg" title="OmniFocus Packing 2" /></p>

<p>It looks overwhelming, but that’s why I set each project up to be sequential. In OmniFocus, projects can be organized so that you can only see what the next action is, which is helpful for projects where you can’t move on to step two without completing step one. In general, I never ever use sequential projects because most things in my life don’t operate that way. However, by making each area a sequential project, I can force myself (or at least gently prod myself) to finish each small area before moving on to the next one. Switching OmniFocus to view only the next available actions makes my goals feel much more attainable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/omnipack-3.jpg" title="OmniFocus Packing 3" /></p>

<p>OmniFocus’s mobile apps deal with sequential projects marvelously. As I tear through little areas within my apartment I can tick them off on my iPhone or iPad, and the next area I need to focus on pops up instantaneously. I get the gratifying sense of accomplishment I had hoped for, and it helps push me to get the next little bit done. Plus, seeing what I have in store is only two taps away by switching the view from “Available” (left) to “Remaining” (right).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/omnipack-4.jpg" title="OmniFocus Packing 4" /></p>

<p>It’s not the most thorough OmniFocus workflow (I don’t even make use of Contexts and Perspectives for this, though I have some ideas how I could), but so far its proven quite effective. My dry run for this was with the dresser in my bedroom earlier today. Even if I weren’t moving, that thing had gotten out of control. I felt like a dope, but I fired up OmniFocus and made a new action for each drawer. Of course this feels like overkill, but “clean your goddam room” doesn’t get through to me any better today than it did in junior high school. Now, my drawers are cleaned out and I’ve got a stack of clothes ready to donate. Extending this to the rest of the apartment only seems natural.</p>

<p>Back to packing, though. I’ve got a <em>lot</em> of next actions to tear through.</p>

<p>Loved this story in today’s <em>Times</em>. People all across the country are raising chickens to save money on eggs. The real victims of this development, it turns out, are the bears.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/work-in-progress-the-digital-bolex-camera-is-a-crowdfunded-filmmaking-revolution">interviewed Joe Rubinstein and Elle Schneider</a>, makers of the forthcoming <a href="http://www.digitalbolex.com/">Digital Bolex</a>, for The Creators Project. I love the way this project is coming together and that we&rsquo;re at a point, thanks to crowd-funding platforms like Kickstarter and the modularity of technology, that two film nerds could think up a camera and actually get it built.</p>

<p>Plus, Elle owns up to the camera&rsquo;s unique style:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to blame someone for retro-fying the camera a bit, a lot of that blame falls on me. I originally got the idea for fancifying our pistol grip from seeing this Bolex called the <a href="http://www.bolexcollector.com/cameras/160.html">Macrozoom</a> that everybody loathes. And the crank idea was also stolen from that Bolex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really can&rsquo;t wait to see one of these in the wild.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/nyc-bw.jpg" title="Brooklyn Sunset" /></p>

<p>I have exciting news to share. After almost six years here, I&rsquo;m moving out of New York City. It has always been a dream of mine to live here, at least for a while. Five apartments and three boroughs later, I suppose I can check that off my list. Time for the next adventure.</p>

<p>So at the end of this month I&rsquo;m moving to Austin, Texas, following the lead of my lovely and brilliant girlfriend, Kristyn Goldberg<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, who will be getting her PhD at the University of Texas. Along with our dog, <a href="http://500px.com/photo/9020811">Krull</a>, we&rsquo;re heading southwest into the heat and eventual balm of a town I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a bit while covering SXSW.</p>

<p>I could go on for pages and pages and pages about how I feel about this city and why I&rsquo;m excited for this move, but for now I&rsquo;ll spare you. All I can say is thank you, to my readers, my friends, my family and the people in the New York film, media and blogging communities who have welcomed me and let me play in this incredible town.</p>

<p>Now, on to Austin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’ve ever dipped your toes into hacking OmniFocus (or spent even a moment on Omni’s excellent forums) then you’ve heard of RobTrew. His scripts are essential, doubly so if you ever find yourself suddenly becoming an edgecase. When MobileMe closed down on June 30th, with it went his scripts.</p>

<p>Of course, Rob was on top of it. You can <a href="http://www.complexpoint.macmate.me/">find all of his scripts here</a>, though his original Omni Group <a href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=24765">forum post</a> implies they may be moving eventually. Get ‘em while they’re hot.</p>

<p>And thanks, RobTrew. These are awesome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unless I have to, I don’t buy paper books anymore. I don’t read a lot of books (Instapaper has handily overtaken my attention) but when I do I prefer to buy them from Amazon. Well, I did until recently.</p>

<p>Far and away Amazon offers the most compelling electronic reading experience. Almost anywhere I can access the Internet, I can read a Kindle book. That’s huge. There’s only one problem. As pointed out by <a href="http://dailyexhaust.com/2012/06/improved-reading-experience-no.html">Bryan Larrick over at Daily Exhaust</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> last week, Amazon recently updated the Kindle for iOS app with the following adjustment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Improved reading experience on iPad: Smaller margins and a cleaner look help you focus on the author’s words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Larrick goes into detail, with great illustrations, about why this update makes reading worse, but here’s the short of his take on those new margins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What Amazon has done is create a solid mass of text that has no breathing room. It’s claustrophobic. It’s stressed. It’s like standing three feet in front of a brick wall and pretending you’re appreciating the architecture of a building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it comes to issues of design and typography, I try to make sure I’m not overthinking things, that I’m not just being a princess nagged by a pea. Still, I’ve given the new Kindle app a little over a week of daily use and it is absolutely abysmal. My eyes get tired more quickly and I have to look away from the screen more often. In turn it takes me longer to get through a book. And that annoys me.</p>

<p>Over time, iBooks has grown into my favorite reading app. The font choices are excellent and the fullscreen view fixes the app’s formerly skeuomorphic/fetishistic paper feel. Apple even gives you option to align your text left, or “ragged right” in printspeak, and toggle hyphenation on and off, which helps avoid the massive “rivers” of whitespace running down the page that plague the newest Kindle app. Even the page and notes sync between iBooks on iPad and iPhone, powered by iCloud, is far more intuitive than Amazon’s “Whispersync”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> system. So shouldn’t I just switch to iBooks?</p>

<p>The trouble is that I’ve been spoiled by Amazon’s ecosystem. I love that I can get a few pages in on a Mac or in a Web browser.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> If ever I need to quote a book or go back to notes, their <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/">kindle.amazon.com</a> is a total treat.</p>

<p>But for now, I loathe reading with these new margins on my iPad. And that makes me never want to buy a Kindle book again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I switched to <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a> on my Mac and iOS for email earlier this year and I absolutely love it. The gang at Sparrow now maintains two Tumblrs listing tips about both the Mac and iOS versions of the app: <a href="http://sparrowtips.tumblr.com/">Sparrowtips</a> and <a href="http://sprwiphonetips.tumblr.com/">Sparrow iPhone Tips</a>.</p>

<p>Sparrow is an extremely powerful mail application on any platform, but the tips listed on these sites are little nuances that took me weeks and months to discover. Glad to see they’ll be easy to find and visualize on day one.</p>
