  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/12/pb-to-of.png" title="Pinboard to OmniFocus via Mail Drop" /></p>

<p>This morning I got a happy little email informing me that my <a href="https://manage.sync.omnigroup.com">Omni Sync Server</a> account now has an access to the <a href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showpost.php?p=118013&amp;postcount=1">Mail Drop beta</a>. David Sparks gave a <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2012/12/the-omnifocus-mail-drop-1">nice intro</a> to it over the weekend.</p>

<p>In short: you send an email to your Mail Drop address and poof, it&rsquo;s in your OmniFocus inbox. The company has offered a &ldquo;Send to OmniFocus&rdquo; service for a some time now, but it required you to receive an email back from a server and tap a link to move into OmniFocus on your iOS device. Now it all happens on the server; send once and done.</p>

<p>I decided to revisit an old failed experiment of mine today: sending <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> bookmarks to OmniFocus by way of <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>. With The Omni Group taking care of the heavy lifting now (as opposed to me keeping my Mac at home sucking in emails) it seems to be a more viable workflow.</p>

<p>You can start using my IFTTT recipe <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/69609">by going here</a>. Once you set it up with your super-secret Mail Drop address, any public bookmark you tag &ldquo;toof&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (or whatever you choose) will get moved over to your OmniFocus inbox. In my experience the IFTTT recipes trigger about every 15 minutes, and so far OmniSync&rsquo;s Mail Drop has been seemingly instantaneous.</p>

<p>Now <em>why</em> would you want to use this?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that there are already a number of ways to get things into OmniFocus even on an iOS device. Alex Popescu&rsquo;s <a href="http://jots.mypopescu.com/post/9353259803/a-generalized-omnifocus-bookmarklet-with-support-for">bookmarklet</a> does an excellent job of flipping you from Safari to OF on any platform, for example. <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/08/24/mr-reader-update/">Mr. Reader</a>, my iPad RSS reader of choice, has great OmniFocus integration. The thing about those implementations is that they all require me to stop what I&rsquo;m doing and open up OmniFocus.</p>

<p>Generally, I send URLs to OmniFocus that I either want to read later<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> or write up here on the candler blog. With this recipe I can go about my RSS reading, find a cool article, send it to Pinboard with my incredibly clever &ldquo;toof&rdquo; tag and continue reading. Better still, I can now send the item to <em>both</em> Pinboard (my cold storage) and OmniFocus (my hot plate).</p>

<p>If you use OmniFocus on more than one platform, I highly recommend the free <a href="https://manage.sync.omnigroup.com">Omni Sync Server</a> service; I would have even before the addition of Mail Drop. Once you&rsquo;ve got Mail Drop up and running, you can give the <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/69609">Pinboard to OmniFocus via Mail Drop</a> IFTTT recipe a try. Happy pinning.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I used IFTTT&rsquo;s Gmail channel because their stock Email channel adds a bit of branding to the email. It&rsquo;s not terribly annoying, but it will end up in your OmniFocus note as text. If you don&rsquo;t use Gmail just whip up a similar recipe using the Email channel. </p>

<p>It’s a mixed bag. I love Shady Characters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/12/sublime-day-one.jpg" title="Sublime Text to Day One" /></p>

<p>I really enjoy using <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>. Like <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/slogger-and-day-one-memories/">Federico Viticci at MacStories</a>, however, I have been wondering whether or not I should be writing more of my thoughts in it exclusively rather than relying on <a href="http://ttscoff.github.com/Slogger/">Slogger</a> to collect every ounce of my digital existence. Here’s how he put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want my thoughts — not my stupid Twitter jokes — to be read by someone who, for some reason, will care about the life I had.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so I’ve been making a concerted effort to write in it more. It’s a pity, then, that I don’t like writing in Day One itself.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Day One on the Mac offers nine fonts for both reading and composing: Anonymous Pro, Avenir, Baskerville, Courier New, Futura, Helvetica Neue, Hoefler Text, Lato and Noteworthy. On that list I find only Avenir, Helvetica Neue and Lato sensible options for writing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I have no idea why Noteworthy made the cut and don’t get me started on Courier New, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/11/which-courier/">the worst Courier</a>.</p>

<p>Though the app does sport my favorite Markdown syntax highlighting (love that blue) overall it’s lacking as an editor. I find myself writing in other apps and copying the text into it.</p>

<p>Lately I spend almost all of my time in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 2</a>. I’ve tricked it out with plugins and what-not so I’m able to write faster and more comfortably. It’s even got <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/12/03/bufferscroll/">typewriter scrolling</a> now. And, of course, I can write with whatever font I please.</p>

<p>In order to expedite the process of getting my writing from Sublime Text into Day One, I wrote this quick and dirty Sublime build system. You can check out the code <a href="https://gist.github.com/4234856">here</a>, or follow the installation instructions below.</p>

<p>The long and short of this is that I <em>want</em> to write more original pieces about what is happening in my life today and store them in Day One. But I also want to use the tools I have at hand to write quickly and comfortably. This little workaround gives me the best of both worlds.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/tools/">Day One Command Line Interface</a>.</li>
  <li>Download and unzip <a href="http://poritsky.com/phpatm/index.php?action=downloadfile&amp;filename=Day%20One.sublime-build.zip&amp;directory=&amp;">Day One.sublime-build.zip</a>.</li>
  <li>Move <code>Day One.sublime-build</code> to <code>~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/</code></li>
  <li>Open the document you want to move to Day One in Sublime Text.</li>
  <li>From the Tools menu choose Build System &gt; Day One.</li>
  <li>Typing ⌘B or choosing Build from the Tools menu will send the current document to Day One as a new post.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Day One will not open after you run Build, but you will get a notification in Sublime Text’s console (along the bottom of the window) that a new entry has been created.</li>
  <li>If you use the Build function regularly, be sure to change Build System back to either Automatic (or whatever system you regularly use) when you are done sending to Day One.</li>
</ul>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>On iOS I prefer to compose entries in <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a> which has an excellent “Send to Day One” button. On the Mac…well, pay attention…<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a>, the plain text screenwriting syntax that is <a href="http://candlerblog.com/projects/">near to my heart</a>, is an ever-growing, ever-changing endeavor. New <a href="http://fountain.io/apps">apps</a> that support Fountain are cropping up and writers are exploring new workflows all the time.</p>

<p>In an effort to put our minds together, I created a glassboard called “Take Fountain” where anyone can discuss Fountain use-cases, hacks, ideas and whatnot. If you aren’t familiar, <a href="http://glassboard.com">Glassboard</a> is “a private social network for groups” that has an excellent iOS app and a rock solid Web site.</p>

<p>I’m opening this glassboard up to the public. To join it follow the following link:</p>

<p><a href="https://app.glassboard.com/web/invitation/code/gsaiw">Join the “Take Fountain” Glassboard</a></p>

<p>Additionally you can use the invite code <code>gsaiw</code> in Glassboard to join.</p>

<p>The inspiration here is Collin Donnell’s excellent board “<a href="http://collindonnell.com/2012/08/23/a-chair-about-running-glassboard/">A Chair About Running</a>” which uses the same public/private approach. I’ve found it to be consistently useful with a very high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://app.glassboard.com/web/invitation/code/gsaiw">come on in</a> to “Take Fountain” and discuss the plain text screenwriting revolution. We’d love to hear from you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I only just discovered this Sublime Text plugin today. <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/BufferScroll">BufferScroll</a> does a lot<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that I still need to stress test, but the big reason I’m into it: typewriter scrolling.</p>

<p>It’s not nearly as slick as some other apps<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that sport typewriter scrolling (no sliding animation) but it works nicely. And it’s great for lengthy documents, like <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/11/26/fountain-for-sublime-text-updated/">Fountain screenplays</a>.</p>

<p>If you use Sublime Text to write, go get this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After you set the Typewriter Scrolling to <code>true</code> per the plugin’s directions, be sure to restart Sublime Text. Then scroll, baby, scroll.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/11/mail-to-day-one.jpg" title="Mail to Day One" /></p>

<p>For months I have been using Brett Terpstra’s <a href="http://ttscoff.github.com/Slogger/">Slogger</a> to fill up <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> with my collected tweets, blog posts, listening preferences and the like. It wasn’t until last week, though, traveling back to Philadelphia for Thanksgiving, that I started writing entries into the Mac and iOS journaling app. I’m really enjoying dumping my thoughts, my worries, my dreams into Day One. I honestly have no idea whether I’ll want to look back on any of the stuff I siphon into it, but for now I’m happy it’s there.</p>

<p>I’ve been poking around the web the past few days to figure out how to get emails into Day One. It sounds like an odd request (why not just search for emails as needed?), but I’d like to explain why I set out to make this happen.</p>

<h3 id="a-personal-use">A Personal Use</h3>

<p>My great aunt isn’t doing too well. She’s been in the hospital these past few weeks recovering from complications after surgery. I visited her in the hospital when I was home and we had a great conversation. She’s tough, but in the days since we spoke she took a bit of a turn.</p>

<p>The whole ordeal gives me pause. It makes me think of the conversations she and I <em>haven’t</em> had over the years, the ones I had planned to have “later.” I also think of the many conversations we’ve had that I plumb forgot. And so I’ve been making an effort to recount my time with her in Day One, to at least keep track of how this experience has been for me and my family.</p>

<p>My cousins (my aunt’s daughters) and my mother have been texting and emailing updates as things progress. I’ve gotten enough of these emails now to recognize that there is some lasting value to them. They are little notes along this path; little reminders of what’s going on in my world right now. Those are the kinds of signifiers I’d like culled and collected into Day One.</p>

<h3 id="more-generally-correspondence">More Generally, Correspondence</h3>

<p>On rare occasions I’ll go looking through old emails for fun, to see what I was thinking way back when or check out who was saying what to me. Since email is ever-searchable, I generally just let it all pile up, ready for retrieval if ever I need a specific message.</p>

<p>I’d like to collect some of my more interesting correspondence. Good news, bad news, intriguing arguments…a lot of this sort of thing still happens in email for me. I can think of more than a few instances of emails from the past decade that I’ve wanted to retrieve, only to find that they’re lost for good.</p>

<p>So I’ll start clipping emails to Day One. Not all of them, of course. Just the ones that seem impactful to me.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>

<p>This service triggers an AppleScript that creates a new Day One entry with the contents of the currently selected email in Apple Mail. The entry’s date will match email’s date stamp and the entry text will look like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
<span class="line-number">9</span>
<span class="line-number">10</span>
<span class="line-number">11</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">## Email Message from {Sender}
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">[View Original Message](message://path-to-email)
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">**Subject:** {Subject}
</span><span class="line">**From:** {Sender} ({sender's email address})
</span><span class="line">**Date:** {the date}
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">---
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">{Email content}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Once the script does its magic you’ll get a <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> notification (if you have it installed) letting you know entry has been created. Day One doesn’t need to be open for this to work, nor will it launch or activate.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> The AppleScript requires the Day One Command Line Interface. It’s a very simple installation; <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/tools/">go get it</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to just try the raw AppleScript and trigger it from elsewhere, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/4164966">view and download it here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have the <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/tools/">Day One Command Line Interface</a> installed.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://poritsky.com/phpatm/index.php?action=downloadfile&amp;filename=Apple%20Mail%20to%20Day%20One.zip&amp;directory=&amp;">Apple Mail to Day One.zip</a> and unzip it.</li>
  <li>Move <code>Apple Mail to Day One.workflow</code> to <code>~/Library/Services/</code>.</li>
  <li>Configure a Keyboard Shortcut in System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Services. I recommend ^⌥⌘D, only because that’s what I’m using.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This service doesn’t actually receive any input before running the AppleScript, however it is restricted to only work in Apple Mail. As such your keyboard shortcut won’t be global; it will only clip the message if Mail is active.</li>
  <li>No formatting from the body of your message will be retained, so no links or quote levels. I’d like to change this in the future but the only way to get it working through AppleScript seems to be parsing the raw source message, which is a real pain.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>I made this for clipping received messages. Running it on a sent message will work, but it will look like it’s “from” you (which it is).</li>
  <li>Attachments don’t carry over into Day One, but the CLI does make it pretty simple to pass an image to Day One. Maybe in the future I’ll make a different service to get attached pics into Day One.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="big-thanks">Big Thanks</h4>

<p>This script is a modified version of one by Justin Lancy (aka <a href="http://veritrope.com">Veritrope</a>). His original could take mail messages and <a href="http://veritrope.com/code/apple-mail-export-to-text-file-w-basic-header-info">export them into text documents</a>. His code was damn clean; I barely changed anything but the output.</p>

<p>The structure of the mail message link is based on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/12/message_urls_leopard_mail">this 2007 AppleScript by John Gruber</a>. Still works.</p>

<p>Initially I tried to get this working with Brett Terpstra’s <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/system-service-clip-to-day-one/">Clip To Day One System Service</a>. Once I started working with the Day One CLI, I realized I didn’t need to mangle Brett’s ruby script. (The holdup was getting the Day One entry’s creation date to match the email’s received date.) I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to throw a little something my way I’d be very appreciative. I maintain <em>the candler blog</em> and these other little <a href="http://candlerblog.com/projects/">projects</a> in my spare time. If you’re able and want to get me a coffee, a beer or dinner, this is the easiest way to do it. I thank you in advance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://britify.com/">BRITify</a>, a service that makes Spotify playlists out of BBC radio track lists, got a slick design update today. Here’s what it looks like now:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/11/britify.png" title="BRITify Redesign" /></p>

<p>My favorite lists are on BBC 6, specifically the Radcliffe and Maconie show.</p>

<p>For the most part I listen to my own iTunes collection or Pandora, and Rdio and I have an on-again-off-again relationship. BRITify is basically the only thing that keeps me coming back to Spotify. I really wish these guys would cull the same data and make Rdio playlists.</p>

  <p>Is the iPad mini <em>better</em> for screenplays than the full-size iPad? Maybe. It’s smaller and lighter, and much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time. If I were buying something primarily as a screenplay reading device, I’d get the mini.</p>
