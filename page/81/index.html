  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ParryGrippGuitar.jpg" title="Parry Gripp playing Guitar" />If you travel in meme circles, then you’ve probably heard of Parry Gripp. If not, then let me fill you in. Gripp is a singer and songwriter who, before 2008 at least, is known for starting the band Nerf Herder, whose music was featured as the theme song for Joss Whedon’s “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”. On January 1, 2008, he launched a website, <a href="http://parrygripp.com/">Parry Gripp Song of the Week</a>, whose purpose is self explanatory. Since then, he has kept true to his promise, uploading at least one song every week. He has also written jingles that go along with some of the most popular Youtube videos, which in turn become even more popular Youtube videos. As such he has become something of a web phenom, most recently with his <a href="http://nachosny.com/2010/02/02/ipad-nachos-video/">iPad/Nachos song and video</a> featured below. I recently had a chat with Parry about his career, the oddities of internet-creation, and some of the darker legal corridors that come with trying to have a good time online. It’s worth a listen and features some of his silliest work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The voting is over and the results are in: for the first time in 65 years the
Academy Awards has ten films contending for the Best Picture statue. Wow,
that’s twice as many movies as before; how can we make sense of all of them.
Of course you should see all ten films and make an informed decision, or just
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/02/02/guide-to-the-2010-oscar-
nominees/">read what the candler blog has to say about
them</a>. In the meantime we’ve parsed a bit of data and laid it out for you
in colorful glory. I’ll let the graphic speak for itself, so take a peek.</p>

<p>That’s a lot to take in at once. No matter how much data we can look at, from
a film’s gross to Academy voters’ tendencies, the truth is that most voters
work hard to inform themselves and make the decisions they feel are right in
their hearts. We’ve got a whole month of speculation ahead of us, but feel
free to leave your gut reactions in the comments. Happy Awards Season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple’s iPad is 2 months from release and the Internet seems to have already made up
its mind on the device, one way or another. This is all based on total speculation as
even those who have handled the tablet haven’t done so long enough to offer an informed
opinion. So while the mud and rainbows sling elsewhere, I would like to speculate how
the device will impact filmmakers should it be embraced after launch.</p>

<p>First off, let’s look at the iPhone/iPod Touch which has enjoyed decent success in the
film community. There are apps available as simple as <a href="http://www.aja.com/news/index_article.php?id=101">AJA’s data rate
calculator</a> for estimating video file
sizes and as complex as screenwriting applications. You can plug your iPod into an
<a href="http://www.alesis.com/protrack">Alesis ProTrack</a> and record audio via XLR mics. This
doesn’t even to mention the simpler things like the video capabilities of the iPhone
3GS which gives any maker the ability to shoot a walkthrough or concept video whenever
they deem necessary. Today, the filmmaker finds a decent tool in the iPhone/iPod Touch.</p>

<p>So when voices on the internet decry the new iPad “just a big iPod Touch”, I would ask
the dissenters how they could consider that a bad thing. The truth is that if it were
<em>just</em> a big iPod Touch, it would already solve a great deal of problems with the
smaller screen on Apple’s mobile devices. Even though the device isn’t available in the
wild yet, it is fast becoming clear that the iPad is something more than a glorified
iPhone. Take a look at some of the advanced gestures possible on the iPad in this video
compiled by Gizmodo:</p>

<p>The way Phil Schiller “stacks” those Keynote slides with a two touch gesture is
something that has never been available on any Apple touch device before, and it is a
sign of things to come. Gesturing is about to go way past touching and swiping. So how
could this impact filmmakers? Let’s break it down by department.</p>

<h2 id="pre-production">Pre-Production</h2>

<p>There are some obvious places Pre-Production can use the iPad. On the somewhat mundane
side of things we have <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/app-store/">iWork</a>, Apple’s
desktop-class suite of productivity applications available (I assume) for the device on
Day 1. One could use Numbers on the iPad to figure out a budget, and Pages to make
notes at a meeting or perhaps even markup a script breakdown. But this is basic
productivity that all users, filmmaker or otherwise, will benefit from.</p>

<p>Nearly every iPhone app will run on the iPad, so the tools I mentioned above should all
work on the iPad out of the box. However, each app will be somewhat crippled by its
intended resolution, running a blockier version to fill the 9.7” screen. The developer
behind <a href="http://www.blackmana.com/iphone/products/screenplay">Black Mana’s Screenplay</a>
has already announced an <a href="http://www.blackmana.com/iphone/support/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=105">iPad
version</a> that should
be ready by the product launch. According to the company’s forums, the application will
be for the writing professional, meaning perhaps this will be a full-fledged
screenwriting application. With Apple’s keyboard accessory, the screenwriter could find
him/herself taking up a much smaller footprint at the coffee shop while getting some
serious work done.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest and most ambitious announcement comes from
<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a>, who writes the iPhone GTD application
OmniFocus. A committed Macintosh development firm, Omni has been coding best in class
applications that run alongside traditional productivity suites like iWork or Microsoft
Office. <a href="http://blog.omnigroup.com/2010/01/29/ipad- or-bust/">They have announced plans to bring five of their desktop applications to the
iPad</a>. OmniOutliner is an
organizational application whose feature set goes far deeper than outlining. However,
it does do outlining tasks particularly well and would make idea organization extremely
portable. OmniPlan is a powerful project management application. Given how many moving
parts a film production has and the open nature of OmniPlan (it is extremely
customizable), I could certainly see an entire production being planned out inside of
the application. Then it could be tweaked throughout the production on the minimalist
device. (On a sidenote, Omni is a very big Mac developer whose excitement over the iPad
should not be taken lightly. That they are interested in the platform is reason enough
for creative professionals to take the iPad seriously.)</p>

<p>Back to film specific apps, we have <a href="http://www.cinemek.com/storyboard/index.php">Cinemek’s Storyboard
Composer</a>. While the application is
heavily tied to the iPhone’s camera, which the iPad lacks, and the developers have yet
to address iPad availability, there is no question that the application will continue
to be useful for filmmakers. Personally, I prefer a blank page to storyboard on so that
I can be as unruly as I like, which is where <a href="http://brushesapp.com/">Steve Sprang’s
Brushes</a> would come in. Demoed at Apple’s iPad launch last
week, the application allows you to “paint” with your fingers right on the screen.
Brushes features a powerful toolset of layering and customizable brush settings.
Famously, the iPhone iteration was used to illustrate three New Yorker covers. I’m sure
the iPad version will only make it easier to draw, which would work in tandem with
Storyboard for powerfully organized drawn shot breakdowns.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p>Moving onto the Production phase of a film, let me get back to Omni and discuss
Omnigraffle, a vector-based diagramming application. Not only could a Cinematographer,
Gaffer or a Production Designer use it in Pre-Production to plan out whole shoots, but
imagine having lighting plots and set schematics available digitally on set. A
production could plan exterior shoots with multiple lighting plans all in one iPad, so
when the sun shifts or cloud cover comes in they could quickly access a backup. Better
yet, when you arrive at a location to find a vital aspect of the room has changed, say
the art director changed a circular table to a longer rectangular one, you could
quickly adjust the change and deploy your light and camera plots via the iPad. The
precision OmniGraffle offers, down to the inch, allows for a slimmer margin of error
than plain old paper and pencil. That means that even the most complex of shots can be
easily imagined in an iPad before doing a trial and error on set. A handful of swipes
could save hours worth of mistakes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davideubank.com/Good_Focus/pCAM_Film+Digital_Calculator.html">pCam</a> is a
fascinating tool that offers the cinematographer a bevy of mathematical assistance
onset. It’s doubtful the app will be rebuilt for the iPad as its functionality won’t
necessarily benefit from the larger screen. But it’s certainly worth mentioning; after
all, there are working professionals out there who don’t own an iPhone but may be in
the market for an iPad.</p>

<p>Anyone overseeing continuity could load a days worth of photos, either directly with
Apple’s Camera Connection kit or via USB sync with iTunes/iPhoto. Literally thousands
of photos would be accessible and viewable so you could zoom in on that glass mug in
the corner and see how much tea was left in it. While this is possible with an iPhone
right now, the added screen real estate will make the job even easier. I should also
mention that most of these tasks could be done with a laptop, but imagine the
difference between walking around to every corner of a location holding a laptop and
holding an iPad. Swiping and double tapping a 1.5 pound flat screen device seems a lot
easier than setting down a laptop every time you need to change photos or click the
zoom button.</p>

<p>Script supervisors could be reading and annotating the script throughout the day. They
could flip pages without even making a sound, keeping your audio department happy.
Break out Numbers again so the Line Producer can track how over budget you are. While
s/he’s at it, why not make any changes to tomorrow’s call sheets before printing them
out (potentially via bonjour). Basically, imagine anyone on a filmset who now carries a
clipboard or folder toting an iPad instead.</p>

<h2 id="post-production">Post-Production</h2>

<p>Post production has long been the most computerized of departments. Ever since the
advent of  digital, or non-linear editing (NLE), systems, Post has given itself over to
bits and never looked back. Let’s start with the sound department.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.folabs.com/proremote.html">ProRemote</a> is a powerful application that brings
audio sliders to the iPhone. I’m not positive that an iPad specific version is in
development, but if it is it could prove indispensable. Essentially, the iPad would
turn into a mixing board for ProTools and other audio applications. Not only would this
give amateur mixers the tools they need for (relatively) less money than a hardware
solution, but the portability of the iPad would give a multi-touch mixing pad to
location sound personnel.</p>

<p>Dailies deliveries could very well be revolutionized by the iPad. A company like
<a href="http://www.sampledigital.com/">Sample Digital</a>, whose DAX/D3 systems offer robust and
secure dailies viewing through a proprietary app, would do well to offer up an iPad
edition of their software. The dailies and cuts for an entire shoot could be accessible
securely in an iPad, moving the mess of hefty files and disc media to remote servers,
allowing producers, writers and department heads to see anything they want at the tap
of a screen. (Note: Sample Digital’s current workflow, while impressive, utilizes a lot
of non- Apple tools, so I doubt this is something that will happen for quite some time.
That being said, they are not the only game in town for digital deliverables and
someone else could very well make this happen.)</p>

<p>Finally, for the pie-in-the-sky use case, I will come out and speak for all filmmakers
who have embraced the digital age: we want a full-featured mobile touch-screen video
editing solution. The obstacles are great, but the idea is actually quite simple. When
Google Wave was first introduced, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-wave-for- filmmakers-a-concept/">I suggested how it could be used to host a complete
edit of a film via XML
documents</a>
. Since non-linear editing is non-destructive, technically all you are manipulating is
timecode, which is text in a document. We know the iPad can handle some pretty complex
bits of video (H.264 at 720p requires some serious processing power) and we know it can
handle text well enough to run a desktop class word processor. So hardware, save for
disk space, isn’t really the issue. The newest, most tricked out Mac Pros often have
horsepower to spare, so I could envision a world where media is transcoded to iPad
specific codecs in the background, then synced to the iPad for manipulation on the
road. I want to be clear about this: we don’t need transitions, we don’t need titling
effects, we just need to be able to play down and tweak our work on the subway if we
feel the need to. That is, for now. Envisioning building 3D Motion graphics by pinching
and zooming gets me all excited, but I’ll hold off on that capability in hopes of an
NLE, perhaps Final Cut Touch.</p>

<p>So there you have it, just a few filmmaking use cases for Apple’s latest invention, the
iPad. Bear in mind that this entire post has been written sight unseen. Just as when I
first took the wrapping off the iPhone I had no idea I would one day be doing
crosswords on it and recording podcasts, the iPad’s future is completely unknown.
However, for those of us who can see its potential now, there are some immediate
advantages it offers that we can benefit from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/01/rser0l.jpg"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rser0l-
1024x680.jpg" alt="" /></a>Overstylized, overdramatic and overcooked
are all understatements when describing Albert and Allen Hughes’ <em>The Book of
Eli</em>. The only facet of it I can speak highly of is Gary Oldman, who finally
returns to the baddie throne he built so long ago. Otherwise, the film is just
an exercise in technological possibilities on the part of the directors and
their team. We come along for their ride.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the visuals, which is clearly where The Hughes Brothers
devoted most of their efforts. Taking a page out of the <em>Sin City</em> and <em>300</em>
playbooks, the film is mostly greenscreened footage over a hyper-realistic
backdrop. It’s a style, no doubt, but one that is more grating than it is
interesting in this instance. Shot on the RED camera, foreground imagery seems
to break apart very quickly, at least on the print I saw. I don’t care how
many “K”s they put in the resolution, it really did not mix well with the
synthesized backgrounds. Besides that, this steampunk-chic post-apocalypse is
nothing new to audiences. So what do the Hughes Brothers bring to the table
that maybe we haven’t seen before? God!</p>

<p>Religion, specifically Christianity, is also a staple of any horror film worth
its salt, but rarely is it ever forefronted as in <em>The Book of Eli</em>. In short,
Denzel Washington, as the title character, heard a voice tell him to take the
only remaining copy of the King James Bible westward, so he does. That’s all
well and good plot-wise. Not only is a prophetic act of faith a classical
convention, but travelling West on a mission is about as basically litereary
as you can get; this plot ought to be an easy enough canvas to work with.</p>

<p>Enter Carnegie, the aptly named robber-baron who has built a cannibal-free
town through might alone. Played by Gary Oldman, this is the first time in
about a decade the British actor has embraced the his darker side. It suits
him well and it is nice to see him back in snarling form, but that doesn’t
change the fact that his character’s motivation is positively trivial. In
order to further rule over the scum of the earth, Carnegie sends teams out
every day in search of a bible. He explains that the book will give him
supreme power over the weakest walks of society, which is already everyone but
him. When Eli strolls into town, of course, the conflict comes with him. Gun
battles ensue with organized religion in the crosshairs, but the matter is
dealt with so moronically, there may as well be no conflict. With no conflict,
we have a movie I chuckle through while everyone else tries to pay attention.</p>

<p>Denzel broods, but it isn’t enough to save his character from futile
silliness. Early in the film, we see him pop in some earphones and go through
his evening routine. This is where the actor shines, expressing his brute
force during even the most sensitive of moments. The performance is nothing
near the multilayered characters he has built with action collaborator Tony
Scott. In the last ten years, Mr. Washington has been working through his
stardom, digging deeper and deeper on every outing for the beast within each
role. He <em>is</em> an action hero, and he bucks up here and offers as much as he
can.</p>

<p>Now about those headphones. (This is about to get nerdy) We know the film
takes place at least thirty-one years after “the sky opened”, so everything
has been in the shitter for awhile. Using, I assume, a solar charger, Eli
whips out a 3rd generation iPod (the same one featured in Wes Anderson’s
justifiably vintage <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>), which was introduced in 2003.
The he grabs some Dr. Dre Beats headphones, which are displayed prominently a
few times and were introduced, at the earliest, in 2008. Besides the fact that
iPod batteries rarely last more than two years, when the hell did this
apocalypse happen?! How much of a hipster was Eli that he kept his five year
old iPod laying around when he bought brand new $200 Beats just before the
world turned to poo? (Last niggle: where did Mila Kunis get all those form
fitting jeans if all the Gaps and Diesels perished before she was born?) I’d
like to ignore the little things like this, but without a decent conflict, I
had to focus on something for two hours.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to mention the only other thing worth mentioning
(pejoratively) in this film: the long take. Just like <em>Atonement</em> before it,
<em>The Book of Eli</em> features a shot whose purpose is to show off the technical,
and this case technological, prowess of the people behind it. A climactic
gunfight features a handheld camera that bobs and weaves between bullets,
through windows, under cars and over rockets. It’s ridiculous, but the real
trouble with it is that the scene would only be enhanced by editing. I am so
tired of filmmakers doing things for the sake of doing them. Is it a feat of
cinematic science? Sure it is, but what’s the point if the scene doesn’t call
for it? I implore younger filmgoers to consider these things when they watch
the RPG-like scene go down. I’m sure praise will be heaped on cinematographer
Don Burgess in certain circles for pulling this off, but one must ask why the
shot exists. If you can come up with an answer that suits you, then you’re
set. I cannot.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>The Book of Eli</em> could have been a much better film if only the
villain’s motivation were a a bit more foreboding and the anachronistic
goofiness, manifested in unfortunate product placement, were nixed. The post-
apocalypse seems like a fun place to play, I only wish this film didn’t offer
so much more of the same we’ve been seeing for years. It’s an overwrought <em>Mad
Max</em> with a biblical twist. That should either sell you or not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/conanhulu.jpg"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/conanhulu.jpg" alt="" /></a>Now that the dust has finally settled on NBC’s “Tonight Show” debacle, with Jay Leno returning as host of the program, speculators can’t help but predict a landing place for the now jobless Conan O’Brien. It’s assumed that he’ll go to Fox, the only network without a late night talk show currently. However, over at the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/what-if-conan-said-goodbye-nbc-hello-internet/?scp=1&amp;sq=nick%20bilton%20conan&amp;st=cse">New York Times’ Bits Blog</a>, writer Nick Bilton has a different, more ethereal outlet for the ginger haired comic: The Internet!</p>

<p>“So here’s my advice to Mr. O’Brien:” Mr. Bilton offers up, “After he leaves NBC and spends a few months healing his wounds and pulling the troops back together, he should come back and make the Internet his time slot.” The rest of the piece doesn’t say all that much about how to achieve such an end, but does revolve around buzzwords like “Leno!” “Conan!” and “Internet!” proving that even the New York Times isn’t above link-baiting. But there is a story to pull from Bilton’s piece: that the logic behind his Internet Time Slot reflects the outdated viewpoint of the web that still runs rampant among popular thought.</p>

<p>See, it turns out that with the advent of DVR and online clip viewing, younger viewers aren’t tuning in for live television anymore. Bilton references a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/business/media/18carr.html">piece by New York Times snarker David Carr</a> whose title says it all: “It’s not Jay or Conan, It’s Us”. That piece blames late night television’s failing numbers on the wild success of the Internet: “Bedtime used to mean some quality time with your late-night host of choice, but the bedroom has gotten pretty crowded. The nightstand is groaning with options, including Netflix, laptops and a remote that can pull up favored prime-time programs on the DVR. Let me see, that episode of ‘House’ I missed or Conan O’Brien?” He has a point, but what keeps on getting lost in this conversation is some understanding of what the Internet actually is, or could be.</p>

<p>For too long, the Internet has been perceived as a magic box with the potential for wild success that eats media industries for breakfast. That’s where the idea of an Internet Time Slot stems from. See, once Conan O’Brien became embroiled in the whole late night war, not only did his terrestrial television ratings go up, but his Internet footprint went sky-high. Twitter and Facebook campaigns were started overnight with millions pulling for him, a phenomenon that barely happened for his stodgier counterpart, Jay Leno. It is not lost on anyone that this audience, mostly younger, is the lucrative future viewership of the “The Tonight Show” if there is one. So Bilton drew an obvious conclusion. If Conan is huge in the Internet, maybe he should live there. Problem: the Internet isn’t Japan; you can’t live there.</p>

<p>The Internet is a content delivery network, plain and simple. Do you think anyone cared when cable turned digital and started carrying data alongside video into their homes? No, because they got the content they wanted in however many rooms they needed it. Eventually, the Internet will deliver the content to viewers on television sets, perhaps completely on demand. As long as the interface, a big screen with pretty pictures and a reasonably easy to use pointing device, doesn’t change, the viewers won’t care how the content gets there. The real trouble for media moguls is figuring out how to bend to viewing trends since they have built an ecosystem that hasn’t changed much in 60 or 30 years, depending if you’re a network or a cable station. <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2009/03/21/a-lively-debate-with-mark-cuban/">Just look at this tooth and nail debate between Boxee CEO Avner Ronen and vociferous HDNet Chairman Mark Cuban from last March</a>. They’re fighting for their lives.</p>

<p>So that explains the Internet, but what about a time slot? The conversation over at the Times revolves around on demand content, but they forget that <em>when</em> you put that content there matters. The time slot won’t go away. Take a popular show like “Lost”. People watch it when it airs and on ABC.com and on Hulu because they like it. If the final season of “Lost” were to only air on the internet at 9pm and then be available for streaming immediately thereafter, you could be damn sure it would find an audience to watch it at exactly 9pm. That’s what addictive content does. It brings an audience to it, not the other way around. The thing is, when you head down this path, this Internet thing starts to look a lot like Television, which is why it’s a pointless conversation.</p>

<p>The Internet <em>has</em> eaten whole industries before, so it’s fair enough that media moguls should be wary. However, they shouldn’t cling to the old models that don’t allow for growth with the latest and greatest tech. When they do, someone else beats them to the punch and then they’re really up to their neck in it. Just go look at how conveniently (and snarkily) laid out the best clips of the late night wars are set up over at Gawker.TV to see how television networks are losing the battle. I guarantee you if the networks offered an alternative the site’s ham-job encoding of Live TV, Gawker would jump on and embed the network branded (and probably ad-bumped) clips. But remember, they’re missing the boat, and thinking that audience tendencies are wrong basically leaves them without a paddle. Here’s to figuring it out.</p>

documentary, <em>Official Rejection</em>, a backstage tell-all of American film
festival culture, is that the film has gone on to be something of a fest
favorite around the country. I first <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/13/deadcenter-
review-official-rejection/">reviewed the film at last year’s
Deadcenter Film Festival</a> in Oklahoma City, where Paul and I agreed we would
find time for an interview. Finally, we have come together to chat about his
film, which is still running the festival circuit, and movies in general. As
Sundance 2010 begins, we thought it would be a perfect time to discuss what
festivals represent in the dreams of filmmakers and what they really are.
Believe it or not, a lot has changed since Paul made the film, so listen in as
he explains where we stand today. Other points of interest: my own bitching
about Blu-Ray, the films Paul is most excited to see, and the two of us
compare war stories on both sides of the critic-filmmaker lines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Hangover-
movie-03.jpg" alt="" />If I were still fifteen, I no doubt would be walking around with
my head held high today. My two favorite movies would have walked off with
Best Motion Picture Golden Globes last night. Not only would I proclaim the
inevitably of <em>Avatar’s</em> snag of Best Motion Picture - Drama, but I would
rejoice in the courage and forward-thinking of the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association (HFPA) for recognizing the genius that is <em>The Hangover</em>, which
won for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical.</p>

<p>But I’m not not fifteen anymore. Nor am I jaded, befuddled or disappointed.
Snark and derision have no place here; let us appraise what these two big wins
at the Golden Globes mean.</p>

<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the candler blog, you know <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/20/avatar-the-problematic-outer-body-
solution-to-cultural-tensions/">Sunrise found
</a><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/20
/avatar-the-problematic-outer-body-solution-to-cultural-tensions/">Avatar</a></em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/20/avatar-the-problematic-
outer-body-solution-to-cultural-tensions/"> a bit
racist, but nonetheless revolutionary from a technological/technical
standpoint</a>. And if you’ve been reading us
since the summer, you know <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07
/review-the-hangover/">that </a><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07
/review-the-hangover/">The Hangover</a></em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-hangover/"> was completely lost on
me</a>, which made me
feel like a pariah in cinephilic circles. For my money, <em>The Hurt Locker</em>
should have taken the Drama statue (and Kathryn Bigelow for director) while
the Comedy award should have gone to <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em>, which was one of the
more intriguing films last year. So what happened?</p>

<p>The Golden Globes are doled out by members of the press, and <em>Avatar</em> and <em>The
Hangover</em> provided some wonderful fodder for off-screen squawking this year.
In other words, they were the bread and butter of journalists of all walks.
Take Todd Phillips, for example. Legend has it he risked his career by not
casting a single “name” in his film while assuming much of the financial
burden as a producer of the film. Literally, if the film tanked, we wouldn’t
see much of him in Hollywood for at least a decade. And then there’s James
Cameron’s 3D epic, for which the director invented a camera that brought the
film’s budget to half a billion dollars. If that weren’t enough, he promoted
the opening of 3D equipped auditoriums across the nation, leading the next
evolution of trickery that will get butts in seats at the cineplex. So yeah,
both of these films have enduring offscreen narratives. But does that make
them worthy of our accolades.</p>

<p>Sure it does! The real surprise here is <em>The Hangover</em>, which purposefully
doesn’t have a respectable bone in its body. It is a gross-out buddy comedy
that digs deep into the darkest corners of our collective psyche. I didn’t
like it, but I can appreciate that the HFPA was so wowed by a comedy that they
offer up its highest honor. Mr. Field has somehow reached the heights that
Bobby and Peter Farrelly have only dreamed of: to be respected as a filmmaker
first and a comedy filmmaker second. It’s going to be hard to follow up this
film. After all, Mr. Field is probably going to make a lot more shlocky
comedies that won’t gain the respect of anyone, but at least he has a Globe in
his treasure chest to push him forward.</p>

<p><em>Avatar</em> is the obvious favorite for every award under the sun, which is a
bummer because it makes me wonder if the people voting on this actually
watched the whole movie. It’s a fine film no doubt, but its greatest
achievements have nothing to do what what actually happens between the film’s
opening and closing credits. 3D is here to stay, again, and this time around
it is all due to the hype behind Mr. Cameron’s film. The release had been
pushed back so many times in an effort to equip more theaters with the
technology, which in essence has helped the tech flourish. Also, he matured
the motion capture aspect of the film so well that it isn’t even part of the
discussion anymore as it is, say, when Robert Zemeckis goes out to make a
film.</p>

<p>It is an unquestionable fact: there are movies before <em>Avatar</em> and there are
movies after. Again, technologically, the film moves us forward.
Unfortunately, the story doesn’t quite live up to the method by which it is
conveyed. But isn’t it enough that we have been moved? Isn’t it enough that
the tech is here because of this film. If you ask me: no. But I can fully
respect the HFPA for honoring such an achievement.</p>

<p>So there you have it. The awards make sense, even when the films don’t. Now,
onto the Oscars and all the trash-talk that comes with them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If this is your first time here, welcome. For repeat offenders, you’ll notice
that the site has gotten a complete overhaul. This has been a long time coming
and it has not been easy deciding a new look and feel for the candler blog. So
while you’re here, take a look around and tell us what you think of our new
digs. There are certainly going to be a few kinks to be ironed out now that
we’ve gone live with this. We’ll get to everything, but don’t be shy, let us
know when you find something that looks out of place. If you want to know the
thinking behind this overhaul, and get a little history about the site too,
click through for the full story.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/tcb_2009.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>First off, I’d like to tell you about the original site design. Based on <a href="http://www.acroyear2.org/">Alex
Smith’s</a>
<a href="http://www.acroyear2.org/infimum/">Infimum</a> theme, we built the site to have
a lot of open space and focus everything on the writing. We wanted the reader
to be engaged right off the bat with the words of each post. The photograph in
the header is one that I took at a bar a few years ago. It is meant to
coincide with the concept of an egg candler, which is where the site gets its
name. Truth be told we had a lot of space in the header and I didn’t want to
put an ad there, so I pulled a number of photos out of my collection and tried
them all. The header was supposed to rotate through different photos, but the
light bulb just stuck.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp_place_holder;</p>

<p>While the original site worked very nicely for a long while, it was limited in
a number of respects. For one, the text came in too low on the page, meaning
the header acted as a complete waste of space. Another problem was the single
sidebar, which made site navigation very confusing. You would either have to
scroll around to find something you wanted or just not get there at all. There
were other bits of code that were a bit too much to bear for novices like us,
but I don’t want to bore you with that.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://andreamignolo.com/">Mignolo’s</a>
<a href="http://andreamignolo.com/oulipo/">Oulipo</a> theme, one of the most enchanting
wordpress themes I have ever come across. We have tweaked the original, but
the idea is essentially the same: text is king but not at the expense of
beauty. Navigation has now been made much simpler with pages on the left and
widgets on the right. The base theme is extremely dynamic and it always let’s
you know where you are and how you got there. The more you click around the
more you’ll understand this concept.</p>

<p>We’re not designers here, we’re film critics, so that’s about as well as I can
describe the redesign. the candler blog started in March of 2009 and has
enjoyed a growing readership ever since. We hope you come back often to check
up on what’s new, and we hope that this new design helps you find some of the
great content we’ve generated since we started. Here’s to another year of
blogging.</p>
