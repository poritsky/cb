<p>The statues are all distributed, the corks are all popped, and now it is time
to talk about the 82nd Academy Awards in the past tense. We’ll get to who won,
but first off I’d like to talk about who lost: the viewing audience. This has
to be one of the worst awards broadcasts in recent memory. Overlong and
underwhelming, the only thing interesting in the show was actually finding out
who won, which is weird because that often takes a backseat to the rest of the
spectacle.</p>

<p>Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin were charming, albeit neutered, hosts. They
farmed the opening number out to Neil Patrick Harris, which was predictably
fine, but it seemed like a complete redux of his bouts as Tony and Emmy host.
On paper it sounds poignant, but in practice it felt stale. I long for the
days when Billy Crystal would superimpose himself into the top nominated
films. I can understand the new hosts wanting to move forward with an original
spin, only this felt like a step backwards.</p>

<p>I’m not going to dissect the interpretive dance number, or “Oscars 2: Electric
Boogaloo,” as I like to call it.</p>

<p>I always tune in for the interstitial montages. There were really only two
this year besides the traditional “In Memoriam.” The first was a John Hughes
tribute, which was accompanied by a flock of the kids he made icons gathered
on stage. The montage itself was probably the best part of the evening,
capturing the essence of Mr. Hughes’ momentous career. It didn’t, however, dig
any deeper than that, which is a shame. Back when Errol Morris was making
these things there was a sense of storytelling to the montages. Even further
back, Chuck Workman used to raise these clip-ups to another artistic level
completely. Ah, the good ol’ days. The other big montage was a celebration of
horror films. This was not nearly as successful as the John Hughes piece.
Whoever made it relied far to heavily on clips from <em>The Shining</em> to get them
out of creative ruts. Nonetheless, it was a fairly decent primer on horror
films, but I’m sure fanboys and fangirls out there will protest.</p>

<p>It turns out spending time showing us all ten Best Picture nominees wasn’t all
that much of a time-suck. The real gouge-your-eyes out moment came later in
the night, when the awards for Best Actor and Actress were given out. Each
nominee was treated to a celebrity pal toasting their careers and
performances. Considering actors, and really all nominees, are supposedly
being graded on a specific performance and not the breadth of their careers,
the mini-retrospective monologues came off more obnoxious than celebratory.
And let’s face it, four of the nominees are going to lose, so let’s move
things along and get to the meat.</p>

<p>As for that meat: it’s a strange world where Sandra Bullock wins an Oscar for
a mediocre performance in an even more mediocre film. All I can imagine is
that the rest of the actresses up for the honor split the vote so severely
that the safest bet, the middle of the road one, got the most votes. Mo’Nique
was completely deserving of the Best Supporting Actress honor. Her speech
featured a nice shout out to Hattie McDaniel, and this time it made a lot more
sense than when George Clooney invoked the actresses name in 2006. Jeff
Bridges looked like the happiest kid in the room, and Christoph Waltz still
scares me after <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>.</p>

<p>While some were a bit put off by Sandy Powell’s acceptance speech when she won
for Best Costume Design for <em>The Young Victoria</em>, I thought it was one of the
most refreshing moments of the evening. She praised the costume designers who
make non-period pieces, essentially imploring the Academy to vote in their
favor more often. This has long been a sticking point of mine: the more frill
and lace a film has the better chance it has of winning costume design. Modern
pieces require a careful hand as well, so she’s right; the Academy should
rethink who they give this award to.</p>

<p>I had Quentin Tarantino pegged for Best Original Screenplay, mostly because I
think <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> lives up to the award’s title so well. Mark Boal
brought us <em>The Hurt Locker</em> so the award is certainly well-deserved, however
I have a feeling it will be the kiss of death for him. I wouldn’t hold my
breath waiting for the next mind-blowing Boal penned script. <em>Precious: Based
on the Novel “Push” by Sapphire</em> is certainly an innovative adaptation, plus
its written lineage is right there it it’s ridiculously long title. Congrats
to Geoffrey Fletcher, on that note.</p>

<p>I’m skipping a lot, I know. They’re threatening to play me off…</p>

<p>Finally, we now live in a world where a woman has won an Oscar for Best
Director. Fourth time’s a charm. This truly was a momentous occasion. Ms.
Bigelow did a phenomenal job with a very difficult film. Unlike a
multi-(hundred)-million dollar spectacle like <em>Avatar</em> or a coming of middle-
age piece like <em>Up in the Air</em>, <em>The Hurt Locker</em> is a loose cannon. It could
have gone horribly wrong in another’s hands. There is very little story to the
film, no relatable antagonists, and the driving theme of modern masculinity
trickles out instead of bombarding the audience. The only thing that could
wrangle such an unstable project is the steady hand of a powerful director. It
is a cinematic achievement and deserving of all the honors it racked up last
night. Congratulations to all.</p>

<p>So there you have it: perhaps the worst Oscars in over a decade. They went for
glitzy but they landed on chintzy. It was long, it was boring, but dammit,
I’ll be back next year to tune in for another show, hoping against hope that
the broadcast will return to its former glory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

content/uploads/2010/03/allfive.png" alt="Five Takes on the Oscars" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve been mostly quiet on the subject of the Oscars this year. Instead of
throw my hat into the race, I’d like to offer up what I’ve noticed of the ways
my friends and colleagues have approached the subject. After all, it is
basically the Super Bowl of film events. So insane has the madness surrounding
the Oscars become, that there is an entire swath of calendar, getting longer
and longer every year, known as “Awards Season”. In the end, I encounter a few
interesting characters in real life and on the web every year surrounding the
Oscar madness. Here’s a peek at who they are.</p>

<h3 id="the-predictors">The Predictors</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/nostradamus-
109x300.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nostradamus know-it-alls. Pontificators. Armchair zen-masters of all things
AMPAS. Sure, in the past week the web was rife with tipsters helping you fill
out an office pool, but the truth is that there is that you can rev up the
prediction machine as early as you like. I have trouble believing that the
whispers of Sandra Bullock’s nomination were driven by seasoned journalists
and critics. More likely it was clever marketeers trying to nudge Academy
voters. But let’s pretend news outlets and bloggers started the early talk on
their own. The whisper became a shout, and would you look at that: Ms. Bullock
is considered the front runner in a race with the likes of Helen Mirren and
Meryl Streep. Although I never reviewed it, I did see <em>The Blind Side</em> and all
I can say is that it’s a topsy turvy world where she gets in a nod in a
category with only 5 slots.</p>

<h3 id="the-beancounters">The Beancounters</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/beancounter.png"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/beancounter-
109x300.png" alt="" /></a>I played this game a few weeks back
with my <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/02/04/82nd-
academy-award-nominees-graphically-explained/">Oscar Infographic</a>. Much like Major League
Baseball’s sabremetricians (look it up), an army of analysts has popped up
around the Oscars. On Friday, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/movies/05awards.html">New York Times featured an analysis of 75
years worth of data</a>,
predicting the winners based on what awards they have garnered throughout the
awards season. This is basically the equivalent of political polling,
determining how people will eventually cast their ballot based on prior
evidence. The truth remains that members of the Academy will vote however they
please. It’s tough to think so black and white about something as subjective
as cinema, which is why I never go for this stuff. I think this year’s
nominees turn most logic on its side anyway when the frontrunner for Best
Picture, <em>Avatar</em>, has been seen by over 3000 times more people than the
second runner up, <em>The Hurt Locker</em>.</p>

<h3 id="the-newsmakers">The Newsmakers</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/newsmaker.png"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/newsmaker-
109x300.png" alt="" /></a>This year is interesting because there
is some actual news to report in advance of the Awards broadcast. When Nicolas
Chartier was caught e-mailing Academy members asking for <em>Hurt Locker</em> votes,
the so-called blogosphere turned the whole event into primetime news. The
producer is now barred from attending the event for breaking Academy rules by
directly soliciting votes. The plot is thickened by the fact that after <em>The
Hurt Locker</em> was nominated for Best Picture, Mr. Chartier had to petition
AMPAS to be considered an eligible recipient of a statue should the film win,
since tradition has mandated only three producers can ever receive the statue
for any top film. What a great story! Except that it has very little to do
with movies. I wouldn’t blame you if you fell asleep during my little
explanation because it really is such a footnote. Personally, my favorite non-
movie related Oscar tale happened in 2000, when 52 statuettes were stolen from
a loading dock in a suburb of Los Angeles, only to show up two weeks later in
a trash can. Come on, that’s way more interesting than some guy rooting for
his film via e-mail.</p>

<h3 id="the-bandwagoners">The Bandwagoners</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bandwagon-
109x300.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You’ve picked a film, and you roll with it. I can jibe with that. After all, I
always root for my baseball team even when the odds are severely against them.
However, you’ve got to come out of the reverie for a little bit if you expect
to have a decent discussion about the awards playing field. This tends to get
pretty silly in the technical categories, where most people have no idea what
criteria are actually being considered and perhaps just pull the lever for
their favorite film. Do you know the difference between Sound Mixing and Sound
Editing? If not, you’ll probably still fight to the death that <em>Inglourious
Basterds</em> is going to take both if that’s your first love this season. Cheers
to you, but maybe dig a bit deeper to figure out what you’re cheering for.</p>

<h3 id="the-too-cool-for-school-awards-nihilists">The Too-Cool-for-School Awards Nihilists</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/coolforschool.png"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/coolforschool-
109x300.png" alt="" /></a>“There is no respect for artistry…”
“The Oscars are just a marketing ploy to push DVD sales…” “If they respected
the best films they’d nominate Jim Jarmusch for…” blah blah blah. I hear this
all the time. The truth is that our entire industry, top to bottom and side to
side, would not function as well as it does without the Oscars. Think about
it: without the Oscars there would not be the bounty of awards shows for every
facet of filmmaking, including the Independent Spirit Awards. And if you think
those are just as dumb, then there will never be any convincing you of any
jury-based rewards system for cinema. If you’re fine with that, then shut up
and don’t tell me who should be nominated for Oscars because you don’t believe
in awards, remember? Every single accolade in this business suffers from the
same kind of silliness and politicking that the Oscars do, it just looks
different. If you think a Palme D’Or or a Golden Lion or a BAFTA holds more
weight than an Oscar, that’s fine. You should just recognize that getting
those awards requires one to play the same kind of game.</p>

<p>Certainly new media has changed the way we approach filmmaking, but how does that mentality actually manifest itself? To find out, I talked to Todd Tue of <a href="http://milkproductsmedia.com/">Milk Products Media</a> this week. Where once makers would upload their work to the web in hopes of gaining exposure to head down a traditional distribution path, Todd is now finding that the internet may be the best outlet for his work, period.</p>

<p>The bulk of our conversation is about Milk Products’ latest documentary endeavor, a feature film about a family
owned and operated dairy farm in Ohio. You can view the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/9183839">short documentary on Vimeo right now</a>, then head on over to their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483189692/from-grass-to-cheese-a-documentary-about-the-nola">Kickstarter page</a> to
learn more about the feature they plan to make. As Todd tells me in our interview, the fact that over 10,000
people have already viewed a short piece he made is pretty satisfying, but he hopes they will get to make the
full length story. Listen in as we talk about making films on the cheap, bringing some creativity to paying
gigs, and why it is such a great time to be making media.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/JeremyHabash.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/JeremyHabash.jpg" alt="Jeremy Cool Habash in Children of the Bible" /></a></p>

<p>How can I explain what the <a href="http://www.sephardicfilmfest.org/films.html">New York Sephardic Jewish
Film</a> Festival is? It’s very name
is so local and yet its scope is entirely global. I suppose I could start by
explaining what is meant by “Sephardic.” Allow me to generalize. Here in New
York City it is pretty common to boil Jews down to one of two stereotypes: the
Orthodox and the nebbish. These are Ashkenazi Jews who, thanks to a sordid
history of European emigration, took root here en masse around the turn of the
20th century. Ashkenazim are basically the shtetl Jews; the <em>Fiddler on the
Roof</em> Jews.</p>

<p>That film is perhaps the ultimate Hollywood pontification on the Jew, an image
of a people that is, for better or worse, an accepted truth. Sephardic Jewry,
who hail from Spain, Northern Africa and the Fertile Crescent (among other
places), have almost no image in American cinema. In fact, in America, little
is known of this “other” kind of Jew outside the confines of the Jewish
community. Sephardim observe different dietary laws (sometimes), speak a
different dialect of Hebrew, observe different customs and have a rich history
of art and literature that is speckled with influence from the various
cultures in which they have existed. How fitting it is then, that there should
be a New York Sephardic Jewish Film Festival, to both celebrate and educate us
on these Jews who perhaps don’t fit the mold of the mainstream. A festival for
the other other.</p>

<p>But what about the films? I was only able to see three films from the fest. I
would like to tell you about two and the third I will review before it’s
snow=postponed screening. The first film I watched was a documentary called
<em>Salvador</em> by Nissim Mossek. Stylistically, the film is very weak, which is to
say there isn’t much style at all. It is a procedural accounting of a
shipwreck that occurred 70 years ago. <em>Salvador</em> achieves its goal of relating
the facts to you with interviews, photographs and found footage. Through all
of it, a small group of “Salvador” survivors meet and journey, for the first
time in over a half century, back to their homeland of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The tale itself is full of intrigue and adventure. As the Nazis gained power
in Bulgaria, it became increasingly difficult for Jews to leave the country.
Enter Dr. Confino, an accidental one-man Zionist enterprise. After receiving
little help from the Zionist movement, whose resources were stretched thin, he
took matters into his own hands to purchase ships and organize clandestine
voyages to Palestine, where the Jewish homeland was being built. After many
successful journeys, things get a bit hazy depending on how you look at the
facts. Confino replaced his best ship, which had trafficked many a Bulgarian
Jew, for the “Salvador”, a vessel considered shoddy at best. Intended to take
around 100 Zionist youths across the sea, the manifest more than tripled
before it left for Palestine, creating a recipe for disaster, which occurred
off the coast of Turkey.</p>

<p>About 5 kilometers south of the Turkish fishing town of Silivri, the boat
capsized and the struggle for shore began. 238 of the 352 people on board
drowned. So harrowing was the event that to this day, local fisherman refer to
the waters where the ship went down as “the sea of the Jews.” What’s so
amazing is that this is only where the adventure begins. Remember, these Jews
who were fleeing from the Nazis now find themselves shipwrecked in Turkey.
Many did make it to the Jewish homeland eventually, and the film clearly tells
their tale. Early on, one of the survivors proclaims that no one cared about
the story back then, and that this film is the first to take on the subject of
the Salvador. It’s true; in 1940 a shipwreck in Turkey is but a footnote to
the ground-shaking news that came out every day. The story of the Salvador is
so riveting it sounds like it would make a great movie. Whether that movie
should necessarily be a documentary or not, I’ll leave up to you to decide.</p>

<p>The second film was another documentary called <em>Children of the Bible</em>, by
Nitza Gonen. This time we have a vivid portrait of rapper Jeremy Cool Habash,
an Ethiopian émigré whose mission is to teach young Ethiopian Israelis about
their heritage. The history of Ethiopian Jewry and their introduction to
Israeli society could fill volumes, but this film tries to focus in on one
man’s mission to teach through music. The short of it is that many Ethiopians
feel displaced in Israeli society where some question their Jewish roots.
Branded as outsiders, many youths turn to American “gangster” culture; to
drugs and violence.</p>

<p>Enter Mr. Habash, who raps in Hebrew and Amharic. He believes that young
Ethiopians should celebrate their heritage rather than try to fit into the
culture that surrounds them. He teaches kids the meanings of their Amharic
names and tells them many stories about what life was like for him in
Ethiopia. The film has many moving moments, like watching the kids perform a
rap they wrote about how they want to grow up, or seeing Jeremy return to
Africa where he acts like a stubborn child to a family not his own. There is
footage of a rally to give equal religious authority to the Ethiopian rabbis,
called the Kesses. <em>Children of the Bible</em> serves as a really interesting
introduction to Ethiopian Jewry for anyone interested.</p>

<p>So there you have it: films for the other other. Perhaps <em>Children of the
Bible</em> could be considered a film for the other other other. Unfortunately I
wasn’t able to see any other films, so I can’t speak for the rest of the
festival. Some screenings have been recheduled due to snow, so check out their
website to see what is still coming.</p>

out-movie-image-31-300x199.jpg" alt="Cop Out Still" /></a><em>Cop Out</em> confirms that
Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer but a mediocre director. There are plenty of
belly laughs in this wayward film, but the plot trickles out too slowly with
an antagonist that is hardly worth the time. Tracy Morgan’s comic muscle
flexes wildly, and Bruce Willis is delightful as the deadbeat straight man, so
the laughs abound. When you’re not laughing, however, you’ll probably be
looking around the theater wondering why everyone slapped down the price of
popcorn in the first place.</p>

<p>Artistically, the film aims for <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> but falls closer to
<em>Dragnet</em>. The real problem is our bad guy, Poh Boy, a Mexican drug lord with
a penchant for pricey sports memorobilia. His “tweak”, if you will, is that he
speaks like Baby Huey and is named after a sandwich. Otherwise, he’s just a
drug dealer like any other: heavily armed and cocksure. I’ll get to our
ludicrous heroes in a moment, but I need to stress that this movie could have
been saved with a better baddie. The jokes flow like beer at a bachelor party
but nothing holds them together. There is no reason not to clip this movie up
into a couple of YouTube replays.</p>

<p>Anyway, let’s head to Tracy Morgan, who plays Paul Hodges, the lovably goofy
detective. His comic gift is difficult to define, but it is a force to be
reckoned with nonetheless. He has mastered the art of the non-sequiter, the
rant, and the rage. The running joke that surrounds all of his characters is
that they are terminally out to lunch, until you realize that a vulnerable
heart beats beneath the blunder-prone exterior. One moment that stands out in
particular is a scene where the team takes a non-English speaking witness to a
Mexican restaurant for some translation. As the girl recounts a tale of horror
entirely in Spanish, Paul listens, slowly and guiltily shoving tortilla chips
into his mouth. With each crunch, the belly laugh gets harder to resist.</p>

<p>Sitting across from Mr. Morgan in that scene is Bruce Willis as Jimmy Monroe,
the Hardy to Paul’s Laurel. Mr. Willis is no stranger to comedy, but we get to
see his masterful straight man on full display here. Whenever he is off alone
tugging on his own plot threads, Mr. Willis is serviceable enough, trudging
through the weak plot surrounding Jimmy. It is when you get him together with
a screwball like Morgan that the fireworks fly. Again, I’ll refer to the scene
in the Mexican restaurant. Without his eagle eyes starting down Paul’s social
ineptitude, the joke simply doesn’t work. We close the laughter circuit with
nothing more than a glare.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes that scene work is the editing, perhaps the unsung
hero of comedy. There are a handful of laughs that come entirely from smartly
placed cuts, and I am happy to report that the editor was none other than
director Kevin Smith. Sure, I may slight his directing, but the fact remains
that the man knows how to cut a laugh or two. Towards the end of the film, a
creeping gunman’s surprised reaction exploded the theater with laughter. It is
carefully placed laughs like this which elevate the film, at least a bit, into
something worth laughing with (not at).</p>

<p>So perhaps it is unfair, a cop out (I’ve made it this far without saying it),
to place all the blame on Mr. Smith for the film’s overall mediocrity.
Certainly, Robb and Mark Cullen, who wrote the thing, should take the brunt of
the criticism. It’s difficult to tell. This is a film that doesn’t know what
it wants to be. Of course it’s a comedy, but the level of goofiness is never
quite decided on throughout. Perhaps Mr. Smith didn’t take the silly factor
far enough. More than likely, however, is that the story just flat out sucked.
Writing funny and writing plot can be very difficult to do at the same time.
Unfortunately for us, Mr. Smith is gifted at both while both Cullens may need
to work on the latter.</p>

<p>A few other strands are worth mentioning. The score, by Harold Faltermeyer, is
a lesson in aural hilarity. It strikes the perfect balance of homage and
parody, something the rest of the film failed to do. Sean William Scott shines
as a third musketeer wedged between Paul and Jimmy. Kevin Pollak makes for a
decent police foil to Mr. Willis, however his sidekick, Adam Brody, does
nothing to impress. As Hunsaker and Mangold, the duo adds little.</p>

<p>So there you have it. <em>Cop Out</em> is heavy on the laughs but low on cohesion.
Mr. Smith really should have taken the reigns on the script and refined it to
a point that it was ready for the big screen. Which is not to say it’s a film
with no value whatsoever. There are at least three moments where milk will
shoot out your nose, which is a fairly high amount of big laughs in a single
feature. So check it out and laugh until it hurts, just don’t expect much of
anything to happen in this film.</p>

into the world of tech for a nice chat with Andrew Kippen, VP of Marketing for
Boxee. For those who are unaware of Boxee, it is a free piece of software that
allows you to experience any kind of digital content, be it local or
streaming, from the comfort of your couch. It is available for Windows, Mac,
Linux and AppleTV, and they will soon be releasing the Boxee Box in
conjunction with D-Link. If it is still unclear what Boxee is, <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">first go to
boxee.tv and click around, maybe install the app</a>. Then
listen to the podcast to hear why this scrappy little company is on the front
lines of a major media distribution revolution.</p>

<p>This summer, Boxee plans to roll out a payments system. Imagine, if you will,
paying only for the channels you actually watch instead of dishing out around
$70 per month for hundreds of channels you don’t watch. Better still, given
the openness of the web and Boxee, almost any content maker can get in on the
fun. As has become painfully honest to networks and studios over the years,
you know longer need to be a major corporation to create content that people
want. With the advent of digital workflows, content creation is already
democratized. Boxee is working to even the playing field for content
distribution.</p>

<p>I’ve said too much already. Click and listen, and tell us your thoughts on
Boxee, streaming video, and the media revolution in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am excited to announce that the candler blog is going to cover the 2010 SXSW
(South by Southwest, for the uninitiated) Film Conference and Festival in
Austin, Texas. With a shiny press badge and a dream in tow, I’ll be bringing
you all the news and reviews from Austin, and I couldn’t be more excited.</p>

<p>Of course, trips like these are quite an expensive endeavor for a blog, so I’m
asking for your help in getting to Austin. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poritsky/the-candler-
blog-covers-sxsw-2010">Please click through to my
Kickstarter Project</a>, where I am trying to raise $500 to defray the costs of
the trip. You will find a longer explanation over at kickstarter (and in the
video above), but this money will essentially cover approximately half of the
expenses for the trip. The candler blog is (and shall remain) a free
publication, but as you may guess it’s not free to operate. Any help you can
offer is extremely appreciated.</p>

<p><a href="http://kck.st/bSKITi"><img src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poritsky/the-candler-blog-covers-
sxsw-2010/widget/card.jpg" alt="" /></a>I don’t expect you to give me
something for nothing. Besides the coverage on the candler blog you’ll be
getting, there are also some pretty nice rewards for different levels of
giving. Everyone who donates $5 or more will be included in a “Thank You” post
listing his/her name and a link to the website/charity of his/her choosing. Up
the donation to $10 and you will get your name and link put in the candler
blog’s blogroll, which runs up the side of the home page, for 6 months. For
$50 or more, you can get a 30-day 200x200 ad on the candler blog that will run
during SXSW. I can tell you that traffic will be significantly higher than
usual during the festival, so this is a great opportunity to reach an
extremely diverse, motivated audience.</p>

<p>I skipped a price on purpose. For $25 or more, you get a 2 DVD collection of
all 8 published Candlercasts at CD Quality (I’ll mail you the discs with the
files on them). When the podcast goes on the site it is in a highly compressed
audio format so it can stream easily and download straight to your iPod/iPhone
with ease. These master recordings are crystal clear, and really sound nothing
like what is on the web. Maybe that’s not enough for you? On the second disc,
you will get the full, unedited, epic Bests of the Decade podcast that I
recorded with Sunrise Tippeconnie. Originally published as 4 trimmed down
podcasts, this lengthy discussion features clips that were never broadcast
online. Please check out the full roster of Candlercasts on the site to see
what you’ll be getting.</p>

<p>Nothing has been more exciting for me than watching the candler blog grow over
the last year. At this time last year, I never would have dreamed I’d be able
to waltz into a fest like SXSW with a press pass in tow. But here I am. None
of it could have been possible without you, the readers. I thank you for your
visits, your comments, and your support. 2010 is off to an exciting start, and
I can’t wait to bring all kinds of great content this year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/02/monique_precious.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/02/monique_precious.jpg" alt="Mo'Nique in Precious" /></a>Lee Daniels’ <em>Precious: Based on
the Novel “Push” by Sapphire</em> is difficult to talk about, let alone sit
through. Part memoir, part fantasy and part social deconstruction, the film
deals in a grab bag of hot button social mores: poverty, racism, rape, incest,
epidemics and education reform to name only a few. The director is literally
playing with fire, yet, somehow, he has managed to make a feel-good movie. You
heard me right.</p>

<p>Clarice Precious Jones lives in Harlem with her abusive mother. The year is
1987 and she is pregnant with her second child by her father. At 16, Precious
is still in junior high school, until her pro-active principal recommends her
for an alternative schooling program called Each One Teach One. It is here,
with the help of a self-assured teacher and a hood-bred cadre of girls, that
her journey of self-discovery begins. What does she discover? The same thing
we know about ten minutes into the film: that her mother is a big ol’ B-word.</p>

<p>Mo’Nique’s performance has been lauded since the film’s premiere at the 2009
Sundance Film Festival, but the comedian has gained ever more traction as
awards season has ramped up. As Mary, the welfare leeching tormentor of the
title character, she has given us a phenomenal peek at the other side of the
line that separates good from evil. The worst villains are the ones whose
motivations are easily understood. What is so damning about this portrait is
that the further you get pulled into siding with Mary, the worse it makes you
feel as a human.</p>

<p>Why go with a comedian, especially one as boisterous and unruly as Mo’nique,
for this role? If I may indulge my darker side for a moment, I believe it is
because the role is actually funny. Her endless rants, her unapologetic abuse
of the welfare system, her physical dominance over her daughter all require a
comedic agility that a classically trained dramatist may not have been able to
pull off. She is not just a monster, she is a devolved woman. The world in
which she lives has literally flipped her inside out. Up may as well be down
for her; she is a comedic villain. Precious must find a way to navigate the
same streets that undid her mother without going down the same path.</p>

<p>For all the deserved praise sent Mo’Nique’s way, the real person we have to
thank is Lee Daniels for seeing the people he needed in each role and bringing
their best out on screen. No one could have played Mary like Mo’Nique, but it
takes a real talent to pull that out of her. The same rings true when it comes
to Gabourey Sidibe as Precious. Similar to a hottie in a horror film, Ms.
Sidibe gave herself over to Mr. Daniels, letting him literally throw just
about everything at her. It isn’t until the end of the film, when the roots of
a lesson have taken hold in her, that the actress is asked to do too much
emoting. Instead, the world around Precious keeps colliding with her. The
deadpan that she retains through all of it is phenomenal. The film would fall
apart completely without it.</p>

<p>Technically, the film suffers from overuse of slow motion effects. As I have
mentioned, the film dips into uncomfortable comedy at points. The truth is
that you can’t have a comedy that is this heavy, so it seems someone, I’d like
to think a studio head, has brought the slow motion effects in to temper the
more raucous moments of the film. For example, when Mary tosses a piece of
chicken at Precious early in the film, the point is made that this is an
abusive home. However, we flip on the slow-mo and a dramatic refrain to point
out that this is important, that this is scary. Without it we might be found
laughing.</p>

<p>I don’t want to spoil anything for you, but Precious contains a masterfully
executed sequence. Invoking Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>, Precious ascends the stairs
to her apartment holding her newborn son. We know that her mother is a ticking
time bomb and that a girl of her stature will have a tough time going up so
many flights. Not missing an opportunity, Mr. Daniels with editor Joe Klotz
drag out the sequence, ensuring racing hearts the whole way through. By the
time she finally opens the door to the apartment, your blood will be at a boil
just waiting for Mary to go off. It is phenomenal.</p>

<p>The real trouble with <em>Precious</em> is that the payoff isn’t necessarily worth
the emotional roller coaster the film puts you through. Sure, by the end you
will probably feel uplifted as our hero walks away with her head held high
(spoiler?), but is it all worth it? Has Precious avoided a bleak future? While
you may be inspired, you will probably come crashing back down to reality and
wonder, for some time, whether or not you actually like the film. Overall, I
can’t quite tell if this is a great film or not. It certainly has a lot going
for it, but it feels more like a first film (it is Mr. Daniels’ second as
director) than a masterpiece. Hopefully, we will see many exciting things from
Lee Daniels in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

/crazy-heart-trailer-3.jpg" alt="Crazy Heart Still" /></a>Early in Scott Cooper’s
<em>Crazy Heart</em>, we see Bad Blake, the middle aged country music star played by
Jeff Bridges, doubled over a trash can puking his guts up. It is
heartbreaking, until Blake reaches into the void to retrieve his sunglasses,
wiping the mucus off as he picks them up. In a manner that only Mr. Bridges
can conjure up, the move comes off as charming, witty almost. Bad Blake is a
drunk in need of a wakeup call. but if not for the brilliant nuance Bridges
brings to the role <em>Crazy Heart</em> would be an after school special, shown at
SADD meetings across the country to keep kids off the bottle.</p>

<p>Often, I find myself complaining about films that have a fat middle, meaning
the conflict isn’t interesting enough to fill ninety-plus minutes so the
makers dilly dally until it’s time for a resolution. In <em>Crazy Heart</em>’s case,
the first act drones on for about 70 minutes before a tangible conflict makes
itself apparent. Now, I’m going to split hairs for a second. When Bad meets
Jean Craddock, he falls in love instantly, but being the lifelong drinker and
wayward musician that he is, the romantic conflict is obvious. The trouble is
that that plot line becomes ancillary by the end of the film, at which point
we realize the real issue was Bad’s drinking. After a disastrous day at the
mall, Bad gets the wakeup call he needs and zip! He goes to rehab, writes a
hit song, and generally makes amends with his life. The roman and the
addiction affect each other, but the problem with this kind of plot is that
nothing much happens save for Bad swirling around the bottom of a toilet bowl
life. Linearly, it just doesn’t hold up.</p>

<p>Now about that performance. Bad Blake is an American paradox. His drinking,
cheating, and down-and-outness are precisely the kind of despicable traits we
would never wish on anyone’s child, yet the result of those hardships are
enduring melodies that have affected generations of country music fans
(fictionally, of course). So here we have to choose if we want him to be a man
or an artist. Mr. Bridges is able to be both at the same time. Even at the
lowest of points, Bridges keeps a glint of hope, of humanity behind the
dwindling shell of a man. The film climaxes in a shopping mall, with Blake
losing Jean’s son, Buddy, when he stops for a drink. Conversationally, to say
“Bad lost Buddy when he stopped for a drink”, one can’t help but think this is
a man who should be strung up, discarded of; a complete deadbeat. However,
watching the scene take place, with the incredible heart that Bridges exudes
in every frame, it is not so black and white. It all goes down in a matter of
seconds and his concern for Buddy is absolute. Much credit goes to Mr.
Cooper’s directing here as well. There is a brilliance to the way in which we
can get on the good side of an inveterate drunk.</p>

<p>Ms. Gyllenhaal, as Jean, is a nice complement to Blake’s oddness. She is so
wholesome, one can’t help but wonder about her motivations in this doomed
relationship. Perhaps dating Blake is a way to scratch a particular itch she
has before getting on with her life. Robert Duvall is absolutely charming in
each of his scenes, which are few and far between, as Bad’s bartender and
mentor. Ironically, the man who may well have enabled his drinking over the
years is who he turns to when he decides to rehabilitate himself. Father
figures lurk in odd places, I suppose. The oddest of casting: Colin Farrell as
the protégé-cum-superstar Tommy Sweet. He certainly has the whole bad boy of
country look down, but in recent years I’ve come to expect his native brogue
whenever he’s onscreen it was tough to see him be so down home. Sure, it’s not
fair of me, but what can I say?</p>

<p>Finally, the music. Producer T-Bone Burnett’s prolific career in the sounds of
Americana infuse the film with a musical maturity that really gives it legs.
Blake’s songs, which are performed throughout by Mr. Bridges, represent a
lifetime’s worth of country composing. None of them are of our time; instead
they span time, musical tastes and even socioeconomic feelings. It sounds like
a body of work, which is exactly what it is meant to be. As a real kicker,
“the song” of the film, “The Weary Kind”, sounds almost exactly like the life-
weary tunes that Neil Diamond, Warren Zevon, and Johnny Cash have recorder in
recent years (and for the latter two, as swan songs). It is a phenomenal song,
and another way to read the film is as the building blocks of a single song.
Perhaps within the short runtime of a song exists the entire universe of one’s
experience.</p>

<p>In general, <em>Crazy Heart</em> is not the kind of film that would be able to get on
my good side. It smacks of being a preachy alcoholism referendum. However, the
combination of a solid soundtrack and an amazing lead performance makes it
something worth checking out, and certainly worth appreciating.</p>

(<a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a>, duh) Film Coference and Festival dropped into my
inbox. While we’re not usually in the business of delineating this kind of
info, this particular document is just so chock full of goodies, I figured it
was worth showing you the moment I could. This is the full list of shorts and
panels for the eight day fest this year, and the panels in particular sound
phenomenal. Quentin Tarantino, Michel Gondry and David Gordon Green are the
headliners, but don’t forget there are tons of other amazing talks scheduled.</p>

<p>The panel featuring Tarantino, “Directing the Dead: Genre Directors Spill
Their Guts” sounds particularly interesting. Actor Jeffrey Tambor will be
teaching his trade in a talk that I hope will feel like something the Scared
Straight talk on Arrested development. <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com">Gizmodo</a>
writer Joel Johnson will offer up some advice on music licensing for viral
videos and friend of the candler blog <a href="http://www.selfreliantfilm.com/">Paul
Harrill</a> (whose award winning short <em>Gina, an
Actress, Age 29</em> recently landed on
<a href="http://www.theauteurs.com/films/22436">theauteurs.com</a>) will be speaking
about “Cinematography for Improvised Films”. For those in attendance, there
certainly is a wide assortment of programming planned. I haven’t even
mentioned the shorts, but check out the full list after the break (it’s a long
one, be prepared). We still don’t know how much of the conference the candler

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SXSW FILM FESTIVAL ANNOUNCES PANELS &amp; SHORTS</strong> <strong>MICHEL GONDRY, QUENTIN
TARANTINO AND DAVID GORDON GREEN</strong> <strong>AMONG KEY PANELISTS AT 2010 EVENT</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Conversation with Michel Gondry</strong><br />
The stratospheric rise of Academy Award-winning visionary Michel Gondry is one
of the great success stories of modern film. Working with fellow travelers
like Spike Jonze, Charlie Kaufman and Bjork, Gondry has made his mark on the
film landscape with iconic work like <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>
and <em>The Science of Sleep</em>. Come and enjoy what promises to be a fascinating
discussion as Gondry discusses his latest, highly personal and emotionally raw
documentary <em>A Thorn in the Heart</em> with TCM’s Elvis Mitchell.</p>

<p><strong>Directing the Dead: Genre Directors Spill Their Guts</strong><br />
How does modern horror take gore beyond the purely grisly to the level of
grand guignol art and imagination?  How does bone-cracking violence and flesh-
rending horror contribute to the hallowed pantheon of art and cinema?  Join
five of the most striking genre filmmakers in modern movies as they lock horns
over the all-important issues of blood, guts and gratuitous gore.  Featuring
Ruben Fleischer (<em>Zombieland</em>), Matt Reeves (<em>Let Me In</em>) Eli Roth (<em>Hostel</em>),
Quentin Tarantino (<em>Inglorious Basterds</em>), Ti West (<em>House of the Devil</em>),
moderated by Scott Weinberg (Cinematical)</p>

<p><strong>Filmmakers in TV: A Case Study</strong><br />
Carving a niche in the world of film is tough enough, and achieving the same
feat on the small screen is no easier. Successfully mastering both is in yet
another league, but somehow the creators of HBO’s <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> are
pulling it off with style.  Find out how Danny McBride (<em>Your Highness</em>), and
filmmakers David Gordon Green (<em>Pineapple Express</em>) and Jody Hill (<em>Observe
and Report</em>) made it look easy in this illuminating, entertaining glimpse at
the art of combining technical skill, sharp comedy writing and moving from the
packed auditorium to the living room couch.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Graphic Novel Hollywood Will Buy</strong><br />
Graphic novels are red hot in Hollywood now. With its combination of words and
visuals in one attractive package, a comic book can be a great sales tool when
pitching your project to studios. Ean Mering (Pomegranate) talks to David Wohl
(Radical Publishing), Martin Shapiro (Night Owl Productions), Matt Hawkins
(Top Cow) and Ted Adams (IDW Publishing) will explain how to create a graphic
novel that will attract the attention of movie producers.</p>

<p>FUTURESTATES</p>

<p>What is the America of the future? In this series of fictional shorts
presented by ITVS, different filmmakers examine current events by
extrapolating them into the future. By embracing elements of speculative and
science fiction, each film creates a fantastic new world to make comment on
our own.</p>

<p><em>Mister Green</em> Director: Greg Pak A parable about change in which a jaded
government undersecretary becomes the unwitting test subject for an
experimental program to curb global warming.</p>

<p><em>Plastic Bag</em> Director: Ramin Bahrani Struggling with its immortality, a lost
plastic bag ventures through the environmentally barren remains of America as
it narrates its search for its master, the young woman who owned and used it
in an era long since past.</p>

<p><em>The Rise</em> Director: Garret Williams In the radically altered housing market
of the future, an older couple must forego their dreams of retirement and home
ownership and in the process, adapt to the ever-evolving definition of the
American dream.</p>

<p><em>Silver Sling</em> Director: Tze Chun In the polarized economy of the near future,
corporations offer subsidies to their high-ranking female employees to pay for
surrogate pregnancies and chemically accelerated births. Here a struggling
career surrogate must decide whether or not to carry the child of two
potential clients, thus giving up her last chance to have a child of her own.</p>

<p><em>Tent City</em> Director: Aldo Velasco In a world where housing is granted only to
the powerful few, a father who makes his living evicting the powerless must
choose between his responsibilities as a provider for his family and his moral
principles.</p>

<p><em>Tia &amp; Marco</em> Director: Annie Howell</p>

<p>When a pregnant border patrol agent discovers an illegal immigrant child
hiding in her home, she is forced to question her loyalty to closed borders.</p>

<p>ALAN GOVENAR SPECIAL PRESENTATION</p>

<p>Texas Folklife will present special screenings of the films of a Texas
treasure–folklorist, writer, photographer and filmmaker Alan Govenar.</p>

<p><em>Cigarette Blues</em> (1985) Co-directed with Les Blank, the film features Sonny
Rhodes and the Texas Twisters performing at Eli’s Mile High Club in Oakland,
California.</p>

<p><em>The Devil’s Swing</em> (2005) The film takes its name from a story people tell in
the isolated region of the Texas-Mexico border and reveals the seemingly
unrelated worlds of sacred rituals, corridos, drug lords, Pancho Villa and the
tragic killing of a nineteen year old boy.</p>

<p><em>The Hard Ride</em> (1996) A journey into the little known world of the black
ranch rodeo culture of Southeast Texas.</p>

<p><em>Little Willie Eason and His Talking Gospel Guitar</em> (2005) Taking place on the
street and in the House of God Church south of Miami, the film highlights the
man who introduced the pedal steel guitar as an instrument for the expression
of faith.</p>

<p><em>The Microtones of Simon Shaheen</em> (2010) The film introduces a virtuoso of the
Arabic oud and violin, and his Palestinian community in Brooklyn.</p>

<p><em>The Poetry of Exactitude</em> (2008) The film delves into the imagination of
Lucien Mouchet and the 1/120th scale carousels and fairground scenes that he
has been making in Paris, France since 1946.</p>

<p>_Stoney Knows How _(1981) Govenar’s first film, is an inside look at the
circus and carnival sideshow from the point of view of Old School tattoo
master, Leonard St. Clair, disabled by arthritis at the age of four, who
joined the circus as a sword swallower as a teenager and tattooed young and
old alike for more than fifty years.</p>

<p><strong>South by Southwest Film Conference &amp; Festival</strong><br />
