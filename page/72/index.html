  <p>While the timing was happenstance, all this breathless wedding coverage
created an uncomfortable juxtaposition for the U.S. networks that’s difficult
to ignore: Primary anchors covering a story on another continent that has zero
impact on the lives of most Americans, even as a series of devastating
tornados ripped through the South.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part I have found all of the Prince William and Kate Middleton
wedding coverage stateside to be a complete waste of space, whether on the
side of gushy puffery or cynical repudiation. However, Brian Lowry over at
<a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR11180361580">Variety</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has brilliantly
written a piece on the media coverage here in the U.S. and pulls no punches.
He also manages to sidestep the whining that has been unavoidable on Twitter
and Facebook today. The media blitz isn’t just annoying, it’s inexcusable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two articles crossed my path recently that offer a bleak outlook for life
after college. The first is by indie powerhouse producer Ted Hope, <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.c
om/tedhope/archives/a_career_in_indie_film_better_have_that_second_job_lined_u
p/">A “Career”
In Indie Film? Better Have That Second Job Lined Up…</a> The other is from Malcolm Harris in the literary magazine <em>n+1</em> and
features an ominous (if Almodóvaran) headline, <a href="http://nplusonemag.com/bad-education">Bad
Education</a>. His piece is much colder
than Hope’s, offering mostly statistical analyses pointing towards a coming
implosion of the American higher-education system and admitting an overall
erosion of its quality over the last four or so decades. Here’s the crux of
it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If tuition has increased astronomically and the portion of money spent on
instruction and student services has fallen, if the (at very least
comparative) market value of a degree has dipped and most students can no
longer afford to enjoy college as a period of intellectual adventure, then at
least one more thing is clear: higher education, for-profit or not, has
increasingly become a scam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over on Hope’s side, focusing mainly on how aspiring filmmakers should expect
to get paid for anything but making films, he proffers these questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we would have more directors, producers, and writers creating more
wonderful work, if we understood better how to earn a living doing one thing
while we give our heart and mind to something else entirely. What are the jobs
that lend themselves to a second profession on the side? How do people gain
the skills that allow them to juggle to careers? What would such a practical
curriculum look like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about this two-years ago in the post <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/22/starting-out-in-film-now-what/">Starting Out in Film, Now
What?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This may seem obvious, but a lot of film schools in the U.S. teach you the
basics of many different fields instead of forcing you to master one. There’s
nothing wrong with that, it’s great to have a wide swath of knowledge as you
start out in the world… If you want to find a job within the film industry you
will have to hone your knowledge in on one specific aspect of the biz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In theory, I agree with Hope, whose experience and insight is worth far more
than mine. What he leaves out, however, is the cold hard fact that Harris
shines a light on: that undergraduate film programs are, by and large, a scam.
I believe in film education and I believe in the university model, but
universities are now run like corporations and the money they are pulling in
isn’t used to attract better faculty. It’s used to attract “better” students.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal for large state universities and elite private colleges alike has
ceased to be (if it ever was) building well-educated citizens; now they hardly
even bother to prepare students to assume their places among the ruling class.
Instead we have, in <a href="http://marcbousquet.net/tableofcontentshtuw.html">[Marc]
Bousquet’s</a> words, “the
entrepreneurial urges, vanity, and hobbyhorses of administrators: Digitize the
curriculum! Build the best pool/golf course/stadium in the state! Bring more
souls to God! Win the all-conference championship!” These expensive projects
are all part of another cycle: corporate universities must be competitive in
recruiting students who may become rich alumni, so they have to spend on
attractive extras, which means they need more revenue, so they need more
students paying higher tuition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my four years at college, I saw all of the changes that Bousquet describes.
Loft-style dorms with luxury amenities, the largest computer lab in the
country at that time and a multi-million dollar apartment for the school’s
president (2 miles away) were a few steps in the corporatized direction my
alma mater took. Meanwhile, our film equipment barely changed from the day I
entered to the day I left, even though the industry was shifting, rapidly, to
HD tapeless workflows.</p>

<p>If, as Harris suggests, the university system is broken, then isn’t the film
school model in just as much disarray? Film programs looks good in a brochure
and often attract wealthy students. The university takes the gamble that most
of film students will change direction at some point and move to a different
discipline, thereby sparing a strain in resources. Also, a student who hits it
big in the film industry offers something even better than a donation:
celebrity. Having a film program today is simply good business.</p>

<p>But what of the education? It’s important to remember that most of the
filmmakers studied in film schools came of age in a time when no such academic
programs existed. The truth is that we don’t <em>need</em> film programs at all. Put
another way, one can’t practice medicine without having gone to medical
school. But to make a film? There is no board that can certify you, no
credential that designates you. The study of film, then, must be, to borrow
Harris’s phrase, a pursuit of “intellectual adventure.”</p>

<p>Which brings me back to Ted Hope’s point. Learning how to survive while doing
something you love is tricky, perhaps harder than can fit in any curriculum.
Go to any festival and you will see the filmmakers who sell themselves well
enough to either get by or get beer money off of their work. This isn’t a
measure of their artistry, but perhaps finding a way to turn film into a
paycheck is an art all its own.</p>

  <p>“It would be tough for anybody to walk into a Fincher movie,” Cronenweth
said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting article by Peter Caranicas in Variety (headline links to
Readability around paywall, for original <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118035866">click
here</a>) about Fincher reaching out
to Jeff Cronenweth to replace his cinematographer for the second time in a
decade. If you follow Fincher’s work, there are a lot of interesting bits
here, like this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was pretty brutal to go into it that way,” [Cronenweth] said, and
initially he was “a bit nervous” about how the digital cinematography would
handle the snow, overcast skies, white fields and dark trees of Sweden’s
wintry landscapes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concerns were unfounded. Shooting is now taking place with Red Epic
cameras and “everything has been fine,” per Cronenweth. “If I had the
opportunity I’d shoot film, but David hasn’t used film since ‘Panic Room’ and
he’s never going back.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>Old hands in the film business point out that past changes in viewing
technology did not bring the calamity that was sometimes predicted.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think it will do harm,” Sidney J. Sheinberg, who was president of MCA in
Mr. Wasserman’s era, said of the new on-demand plan — yet Mr. Sheinberg also
acknowledged that he had been wrong in seeing videocassettes as a threat,
rather than a boon, to the studios in the early 1980s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting NYTimes article explains the current standoff between movie
studios and theater owners over on-demand distribution. The trouble is that
both sides completely miss the point of digital distribution and will
eventually be outmoded by younger, more agile startups that can see what
audiences want (e.g. Boxee Box, AppleTV, Vudu, Vimeo, YouTube, Netflix, etc.).</p>

<p>The tenuous relationship between studios and theaters is as old as cinema
itself. At the end of the day, people will pay to go see a good movie,
something theater owners have no say in. I love the theater experience and I
can’t imagine a movie business without it. Still, when multibillion-dollar
monopolies go to war with each other, it is the viewers who will suffer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Text reformatting is all the rage these days, and I happen to be a big fan.
Though I love good design, ultimately, like most readers, I just want to get
at the content and read it however I want. This is why I added the
“Readability” button you see at the top of every post. If you want to see this
text just as text, so be it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> is an app I use all the time for
exactly this purpose. <a href="https://www.readability.com/">Readability</a> offers a
similar service (with a much nicer web interface) but for a monthly price
which in turn pays publishers, i.e. me. [Flipboard}(http://flipboard.com/)
entered the fray last year as an iPad exclusive app that scoured your Facebook
and Twitter timelines for links to articles, reformatting them into a
magazine-like interface for all to see. It’s free and it’s pretty amazing.</p>

<p>The New York Times, who just put up their own pay wall, sees an opportunity
for monetization in the reformatted web space. Together with
<a href="http://bit.ly/pages/about">bit.ly</a>, the company behind the popular URL
shortening service, they have released <a href="http://www.news.me/">News.me</a>, a
Flipboard alternative with a twist: it costs money and it will supposedly lead
you to content you otherwise might not get to. Eventually, that is.</p>

<p>New.me is free for a week, after that it’s $.99/week or $35/year. But what
does it do? Basically, it pulls links out of your Twitter feed, or the feeds
of people you follow who are also using News.me, and arranges them in a more
readable fashion, with pretty serif headlines. Click on a story and it folds
out to show you the full text of the article. From there you can read it, send
it to Instapaper, e-mail it or share it out to Facebook or Twitter. You can
also mark things to read later, in which case they will be saved for offline
viewing.</p>

<p>The question isn’t “What does News.me do?” but “What does News.me do
differently?” Not much. The only ace in their hole over Flipboard or the
slicker and more useful <a href="http://www.tweetmagapp.com/">TweetMag</a> is that
popular links are supposedly moved to the top of your stream. From their
<a href="http://www.news.me/faqq">FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, News.me filters your content so that you get only the best
stories. This content is chosen based on a combination of popularity and what
you have read or shared in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very interesting. Since bit.ly collects massive amounts of data on
every link they shorten, they are able to determine how many people are
sharing links to the same place and how many people are clicking on it. This
isn’t an exact measure of what will prove to be interesting to you as opposed
to someone else, but it’s a start. The logic is that the more something is
shared, the more likely it is to be interesting to anyone.</p>

<p>This type of automated curation could become very interesting depending on how
much data bit.ly and the New York Times are able to garner from users of
News.me. Today, TweetMag is a much better looking Twitter culling app and
Flipboard more delightful to use. But that’s just today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, Apple previewed the forthcoming edition of Final Cut Pro, dubbed
Final Cut Pro X. I’ve written <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/11/12/a
-wish-list-for-the-2011-final-cut-studio/">here</a>
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/11/17/final-aperture-pro-an-idea-for-
whats-to-come/">before</a> about what I would like to see in the next iteration of the
app and I thought I’d take a moment to share my thoughts on this latest demo.</p>

<h2 id="the-price">The Price</h2>

<p>A lot has been made of Apple’s pricing of FCP X, but I can’t quite see what
the big deal is. Where once Final Cut Pro was only accessible through the
purchase of Final Cut Studio, which most recently sold for $999, Final Cut Pro
X will be available on the App Store for $299. Final Cut Studio included DVD
Studio Pro, Compressor, Motion, Color, Soundtrack Pro and a host of other odds
and ends. Dipping FCP X down to $299 for a stand-alone app sounds about right;
it’s not a deal by any means. Being offered on the App Store may come as a
surprise to anyone who’s ever spent a half day installing it, though I’ll bet
the download alone will take some time.</p>

<h2 id="the-toy">The Toy</h2>

<p>I’ve been hearing that FCP X is a replacement for Final Cut Express, the $199
stand-alone, stripped down version of Final Cut Pro that Apple has been
selling since 2003. This is total misinformation and I’m not sure why people
are jumping to this conclusion. Perhaps the seemingly (but not actually,
remember?) reduced price is fueling this perception.
&amp;nbsp_place_holder;Hopefully Apple will discontinue that product for precisely
this reason. There should only be one Final Cut.</p>

<p>This melds with another point of confusion for Final Cut editors fearful of
change in their workflow: whether or not this is a souped up version of
iMovie. From the demo, it’s clear that Apple has taken cues from iMovie as it
has evolved over the years. This has been expected, as the designer of the
ill-received iMovie ‘08 came from the Final Cut team. However, the only thing
it legitimately shares with the current iMovie appears to be media
organization, something that has always been a sore point for Final Cut Pro
and precisely the direction the software needs to move in the tapeless era. I
expect that we will see Apple testing the waters more and more in iMovie for
features that will one day end up in Final Cut. If that sounds crazy, just
look at how iPhoto and Aperture have coexisted over the years.</p>

<h2 id="the-power">The Power</h2>

<p>64-bit. GPU acceleration. Cocoa.</p>

<p>These are features that are long overdue in Apple’s pro video apps. Though
there have been many advances since Final Cut 1 debuted in 1999, the current
model you could buy in a store today shares not only an interface with the
original but much of the same DNA as it is written in Carbon, OS X’s now
outmoded API. I’m no programmer, but I know enough to know that Cocoa,
Carbon’s successor, enables apps to access OS X’s most modern and most
powerful technologies, namely access to the 64-bit processor (which ups RAM
access way past the 32-bit 4 GB constraint) and access to any available cores
on on your graphics card. Finally, FCP gets to use features in the system that
heretofore had been reserved for designers and gamers.&amp;nbsp_place_holder;</p>

<p>Apple’s approach to harnessing all of this power appears, at least from the
demo, to be somewhat ingenious. For years, Final Cut has featured realtime
playback of certain commonly used effects (color correction, text overlays,
etc.) and hat worked out…okay. “RT Playback” would scale to your system,
allowing only the effects your processor could handle to play without stopping
to render. With FCP X, not only rendering but transcoding are, supposedly, a
thing of the past. For certain tapeless formats (at least for DSLR HD footage)
there will no longer be a time-consuming Log and Transfer transcoding process.
Instead, you will simply bring in your footage and Final Cut will start
churning through transcodes in the background. Effected shots will be rendered
in the background while the editor is none the wiser.</p>

<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2>

<p>Of course, all of this is built to scale with Apple’s systems, so a low-end
MacBook Pro will run differently than a fully configured Mac Pro. The good
news is you can finally have good reason to up your graphics card. iMacs in
particular could become beastly edit bays, offering quad-core processing with
graphics cards carting 1 GB RAM; and that’s only what’s available today.</p>

<p>Hopefully soon, Apple will unleash a new crop of iMacs with the usual round of
spec bumps and, crucially, the recently unveiled Thunderbolt port. Since
Thunderbolt is based around PCI technology, one could conceivably have a full
resolution input/output setup with nothing more than an iMac and a breakout
box. Once storage devices start shipping later this year with the port,
editing high-resolution video will be completely unencumbered on the iMac and
even on the MacBook Pro. AJA, Blackmagic Design and MXO have already announced
interface devices utilizing Thunderbolt, while G-Technology and LaCie are
advertising storage solutions as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-curve">The Curve</h2>

<p>The fear whenever an industry standard app gets rebuilt from the ground up is
that the learning curve will be too sharp for some people to keep up. Apple
has done what few companies in its positing would dare to attempt. Final Cut
is on par with Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop in terms of market
saturation; so many people rely on these apps that to radically change them
could alienate users on a grand scale and, at worst, cripple the industries
that rely on them. For this reason, those two examples have remained fairly
stagnant for decades. Final Cut might avoid that fate or it might send editors
flocking to another platform; time will tell.</p>

<p>The editors who don’t adapt will ultimately be swallowed up by those who will.
I still use Final Cut Pro 6 without too much trouble (though I often wish I
has a ProRes Proxy workflow), but think of the difference. On my old MacBook
Pro, it takes about forty minutes to import an hour of Canon 5D footage. A
colleague with FCP X would already be editing while I was out loafing (or
writing a blog post, or watching <em>Battlestar</em>). The difficulty of the learning
curve is no reason to avoid change. Plus, there’s always Avid and Premiere Pro
(and other stuff I don’t care to mention).</p>

<h2 id="modern-times">Modern Times</h2>

<p>Final Cut and Avid were written around videotape workflows. Not only are fewer
crews shooting tape today, but even film can now be laid off to digital files
and stored on massive hard drives. The age of tape is one of precision and
tangibility, with media that could be labeled, handed off, shelved, retrieved,
and so on. But it is coming to an end.</p>

<p>We are entering the age of tapeless editing, one which asks us to be more
stringent about backups, more exacting about our organization and more
considerate about our space limitations. It is unclear how robust Apple’s file
management is in FCP X, though they did show off some cool tricks involving
keywords and smart folders. The Las Vegas demo focused heavily, in fact only,
on tapeless workflows, which should be a sign of great things to come. Tape
has become a hindrance that manages to slow down workflows even when it is
extricated from the process. If FCP X can drag the champions of tape into the
next era of post-production, then it’s worth not only every penny, but every
headache that is sure to come on everyone’s first project.&amp;nbsp_place_holder;</p>

<p>I, for one, can’t wait.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, the best film blog post of 2011. Definitely worth a read
