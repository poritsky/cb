  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nick Wingfield, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/technology/samsung-and-apple-fail-to-agree-out-of-court.html">reporting for the New York Times</a> on the forthcoming verdict in the Apple/Samsung patent case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Apple prevails, experts believe Samsung and other rivals in the market will have a much stronger incentive to distinguish their smartphone and tablet products with unique features and designs to avoid further legal tangles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Making great products that customers connect with, apparently, was never incentive enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if the jury finds in favor of Samsung, its decision could have the opposite effect, creating a consensus around Apple-like designs for years to come. “Expect to see an awful lot of Apple knockoffs without fear of retribution,” said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean “expect,” Michael?</p>

<p>If Apple loses, the industry-wide aping of their products will continue at roughtly the same rate it has for years. If Apple wins, Samsung will be forced to ship an original design. Should be fun to see how this plays out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, <a href="http://mattfisher.tumblr.com/post/29338478278/my-sister-paid-progressive-insurance-to-defend-her">Matt Fisher took to the web</a> to vent about Progressive Insurance, who stooped to assisting in his sister’s killer’s defense to avoid paying out her policy. The heartbreaking story went viral, forcing Progressive into panic mode and changing the scope of the case. The company <a href="http://mattfisher.tumblr.com/post/29432884849/today-in-response-to-my-blog-post-entitled-my">responded</a> with a non-starter explanation, but now <a href="http://mattfisher.tumblr.com/post/29624596756/my-family-and-i-are-pleased-at-the-prospect">things are looking up</a> (as up as they can be) for the Fisher family.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed, as this story has grown, that many people are making Progressive out to be the ultimate villain, sometimes cheekily.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> While there is blood on their hands, so to speak, there is a lot more at play here. Here’s Matt’s original post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of a sense of honor, and out of a sense of the cost of my sister’s outstanding student loans, my folks opted to try to go after the money through legal channels. At which point they learned another delightful thing. <strong>In Maryland, you may not sue an insurance company when they refuse to fork over your money.</strong> Instead, what they had to do was sue the guy who killed my sister, establish his negligence in court, and then leverage that decision to force Progressive to pay the policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The emphasis is Matt’s, but I’d add it here as well. I know nothing of Maryland’s laws, and in fact I can’t point directly to the offending legislation that would take away a citizen’s right to justice.</p>

<p>However, I can tell you a movie to watch that will help: Susan Saladoff’s <a href="http://www.hotcoffeethemovie.com/"><em>Hot Coffee</em></a>. Here’s what I had to say about it in <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/27/review-hot-coffee/">my review</a> last year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The title comes from one of the most notorious civil lawsuits in recent history, the 1992-1994 case of Stella Liebeck, then a 79-year-old woman who sued McDonald’s after she spilled hot coffee on herself. Liebeck became a punchline after a court awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. The case brought so-called “litigious lawsuits” to the national stage and set off two decades of reform which have in many ways crippled our access to the civil courts. Collectively, we all bought into the story that Liebeck took advantage of the system, but did she?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet I could go up to most of my progressive, more liberal-minded friends and ask them if they remember the case of the woman who sued McDonald’s because their coffee was too hot and get a response along the lines of, “Yeah, that was ridiculous.”</p>

<p>And now we can’t sue corporations when they wrong us. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>Again, from my review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can write to your senators and congresspeople, or to the President for that matter, but it is only within the courts that the average American can take on an insurmountable force like McDonald’s and win. For a brief period, the pendulum swung on the side of the citizens. Was that such a bad thing? Now, we find ourselves in a time when corporations have begun shutting down our access to the courts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Progressive didn’t treat the Fisher family like shit (just) because they’re villains, they did it because they could. I applaud the Fisher family for taking the difficult route of going after what was owed to them, but I especially appreciate the <a href="http://mattfisher.tumblr.com/post/29624596756/my-family-and-i-are-pleased-at-the-prospect">latest note from Matt</a> on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we move forward, we hope to focus on celebrating the joy that Katie brought us and working to change the balance of power between policy holders and the insurance companies they pay to protect them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t a problem limited to insurance companies. Go read your cell phone or credit card contract, for example, and see how much wiggle room you have if you get screwed, even if it’s the company’s fault. Better yet, read the contract you signed at your job.</p>

<p>I encourage the Fisher family to look at what laws have been passed that put the courts on the side of corporations and see what can be done to reverse them. And I encourage everyone to go out and see <em>Hot Coffee</em>. It’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CUL504/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008CUL504&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thecandlerblo-20">streaming on Amazon</a> now. Watch tonight if you can.</p>

<p>The headline of this post promises to tell you the secret to hating a company. Here it is: don’t. Dig deeper and figure out what it is that makes them capable of acting in such a horrific manner. Then work to change that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you’re wondering what seems to be causing all this stir about Web publishing, it’s <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/stop-publishing-web-pages.html">this post by Anil Dash</a> from last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start moving your content management system towards a future where it outputs content to simple APIs, which are consumed by stream-based apps that are either HTML5 in the browser and/or native clients on mobile devices. Insert your advertising into those streams using the same formats and considerations that you use for your own content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I too have thoughts about Twitter’s recent announcement. But first…</p>

<h3 id="recap-skip-ahead-if-youve-heard-this-one-before">Recap (Skip Ahead If You’ve Heard This One Before)</h3>

<p>On Thursday, Twitter pissed of what seems to be every single blog I read when Director of Consumer Product Michael Sippey published a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">detailed list of changes</a> coming to the site’s API.</p>

<p>For some context, here’s the chart Twitter used to explain the changes.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/twitter-chart.png" title="Twitter Dev Chart" /></p>

<p>And the offending passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That upper-right quadrant also includes, of course, “traditional” Twitter clients like <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="http://www.echofon.com/">Echofon</a>. Nearly eighteen months ago, we gave developers guidance that they should not build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience.” [sic] And to reiterate what I wrote in my last post, that guidance continues to apply today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: if you should maybe slip on some ice and fall off a bridge, don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>

<h3 id="smart-people-said-things">Smart People Said Things</h3>

<p>Folks who are much smarter than me had a lot to say about Sippey’s post.</p>

<blockquote><p>So Klout, which is utter vainglorious masturbatory nonsense, that&#8217;s OK. But services like <a href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a> and <a href="http://favstar.fm/">Favstar</a>, which are actually useful and/or fun, those are no good. And don&#8217;t even get me started on Twitter turning against client apps. For chrissake Twitter&#8217;s <em>own</em> app <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie">started life as a third-party client</a>.</p><footer><strong>-John Gruber</strong> <cite><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/16/twitter-drop-dead">Daring Fireball</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What is sad is that as long-time and active users, we’re given no choice in the matter. We must suffer the official clients and we must suffer ads.</p><footer><strong>-Shawn Blanc</strong> <cite><a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/08/twitter-2/">Twitter, Advertisers, Users, and Third-party Devs (in That Order)</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Twitter has stopped caring about the users that made the service popular, and started only to care about the users that can draw in more users.</p><footer><strong>-Ben Brooks</strong> <cite><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/">Twitter’s API Changes</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I sure as hell wouldn’t build a business on Twitter, and I don’t think I’ll even build any nontrivial <em>features</em> on it anymore.</p><footer><strong>-Marco Arment</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes">Interpreting Some of Twitter’s API Changes</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<h3 id="what-to-make-of-all-this">What to Make of All This?</h3>

<p>I like to think of my time writing on the Internet in two separate eras: before I joined Twitter and after. There is no question that the service changed my exposure online. It has helped me reach a wider audience, gotten me in touch with some really smart people and helped me connect with folks who have turned out to be friends and sometime collaborators. So I care deeply about where Twitter is going and what it can (continue to) do for me.</p>

<p>But there are a few things that I need to try to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Twitter doesn’t care about me.</li>
  <li>Past is past.</li>
  <li>We (readers, writers, voyeurs, everyone) are bigger than Twitter.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve all become dependent on what Twitter once was. Even adding “tweet,” both in its verb and noun forms, to the lexicon now seems like a foolhardy move. As much as we want it to be that thing we used to love, Twitter remains a private company that can do whatever the hell it wants. While so many are decrying the fact that Twitter is effectively screwing the users that made it what it is, I can’t help but think, “So what? Isn’t that what companies do?”</p>

<p>Twitter has a storied history of third-party innovation. Craig Hockenberry, maker of Twitterrific, which was an iPhone app even before there was an App Store, details <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">all of the firsts his app contributed</a> to the service. And just like Gruber pointed out, Twitter’s first native iPhone app started out as a third-party client. Tweetie, which the company bought to get into the app game, <em>was</em> a revolutionary take on what a Twitter client could do. However, today’s Twitter app bears almost no resemblance to Tweetie. Once upon a time it represented everything Twitter wanted to be, but that’s no longer true. We can’t change that. The idea that Twitter owes developers anything is a non-starter. It sucks, but they don’t.</p>

<p>Which brings the conversation back to us. We are all bigger than Twitter. I like to think that we are bigger than social media, period. The way I view my history of writing online is problematic. Maybe I have become too reliant on these things that I don’t own. But I own this site. The web, it seems, is where the conversation is happening. Twitter and Facebook and Reddit and everything in between are simply ways to navigate the massive amounts of content floating around in the ether.</p>

<p>Other services will come along<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and most of them will probably fail. Maybe Twitter <em>was</em> a once in a lifetime innovation; maybe nothing will come close to being as great as it once was.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Either way, we’ll all still be here, online, writing and sharing and commenting away. At least, that’s the plan.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I know about <a href="https://join.app.net">App.net</a> and I have lots of thoughts on it, but it deserves its own post.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>That’s assuming, by the way, that we are seeing the end of Twitter’s greatness here. All of this may be a lot of noise through some tough growing pains.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Uh huh. But what does it pay?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, this is not a paid position up front where I hope you can do what you say, this is a commission based position where we work together and use my track record as a basis to attract a few qualified investors to get our next project (a family film comedy based on a true story) into development and production.</p>

<p>Commission based, eh? Sounds great.</p>

  <p>And if you really can produce…you’d better start taking French lessons because our next stop may be the Cannes Film Festival in the south of France…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/magazine/a-critic-makes-the-case-for-critics.html?pagewanted=all">Dwight Garner for the New York Times Magazine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sad truth about the book world is that it doesn’t need more yes-saying novelists and certainly no more yes-saying critics. We are drowning in them. What we need more of, now that newspaper book sections are shrinking and vanishing like glaciers, are excellent and authoritative and punishing critics — perceptive enough to single out the voices that matter for legitimate praise, abusive enough to remind us that not everyone gets, or deserves, a gold star.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seem to be a lot of similarities between the current state of book and film criticism, at least going by Garner’s “Riff.” This next bit, though, points to a stark difference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The novelist Reynolds Price, who died last year, paused to note the sorry status of book sections in his 2009 memoir, “Ardent Spirits.” When he was starting out in the 1950s, he wrote, a first novel in America received about 90 individual reviews; now a decent first novel is lucky to get 20. Most of those will be amiable squirts of plot description topped, like a lemon slice on a Diet Coke, with the dread weasel-word “compelling.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today there is a seemingly endless stream of film criticism coming from all angles. I don’t know how large or influential the online book criticism world is, but the online film criticism one ever-growing. Of course, the description of reviews as plot-description plus sprinkled compliments makes up the bulk of those reviews. We all need to be more punishing. My favorite critics are.</p>

<p>Industrial designer Austin Yang has cooked up a <a href="http://www.austin-yang.com/index.php?/projects/iturntable/">goofy little iPad accessory</a> dubbed the iTypewriter. In his words:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People could be able to recollect old experience and memory by familiar appearance and haptic feedback. Instead of stroking on the screen with no feedback, this product can reflect a strong haptic feedback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admirable. Terrible.</p>

<p>Still, I kinda want one. Maybe a bluetooth version. Here&rsquo;s a video of it in action:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2188636/Ikea-plans-build-100-budget-design-hotels-Europe.html">The Daily Mail</a> reporting on Ikea’s move into hotels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hugely successful furniture retailer is looking to open 100 low-cost hotels across Europe.</p>

  <p>The aim is to create ‘budget design’ properties with a boutique feel at affordable prices - an area considered one of the fastest growing in the hotel industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always wondered what it would be like to live inside on of the little rooms they build inside Ikea showrooms. For a reasonable fee it might be easy to arrange that soon.</p>
