  <div class="entry-content"><p>I won’t mince words: Tony Scott’s <em>Unstoppable</em> is one of the best directorial
efforts to come out of Hollywood this year. Technically masterful, emotionally
even-handed and physically weighty, it is the most accessible of Scott’s
recent deconstructions of the American condition. Even better, the action
sequences stand two heads above anything else made this year.</p>

<p>On his fifth outing with Scott, Denzel Washington plays Frank Barnes, an aging
motorman working towards retirement. Will Colson, played with fluent charisma
by Chris Pine, is a rookie conductor going out for his first day on the tracks
with Barnes as mentor. The relationship is rough from the get-go. Colson is
related to management and works for far less money than those of Barnes’s
generation. He represents the new class pushing out the old, and Barnes never
lets him forget it.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a bumbling driver named Dewey, played by sad sack Ethan Suplee,
accidentally loses control of a half-mile long train with hazardous chemicals
in tow. The series of events that lead to this happening are too confusing to
list here, but it should be noted that they are completely believable and,
more alarmingly, probable. The film, after all, is inspired by true events.</p>

<p>The brilliance of <em>Unstoppable</em> is that the conflict, the speeding train,
lacks a human antagonist. Human error is the cause, a force that weighs
heavily on Dewey throughout the film. There are no terrorists whose
motivations we need question, no obstacles of evil to resist. There is,
however, a bad guy. His name is Galvin (Kevin Dunn), the head of the rail
company who is concerned only with the bottom line, not the toll on human life
the train could cause. Through him, we see the evils of capitalism. A room
full of smarmy executives decide the fates of whole cities based solely on
stock prices. The class struggle between Colson and Barnes is obliterated by
Galvin’s greed.</p>

<p>It really isn’t until the last third of the film that Colson and Barnes begin
to chase the runaway train. Before that, a spectacular plan is put in place to
slow the train down and drop an ex-marine onto it from a helicopter. The
sequence is pitch perfect, not only for its spectacle but for the seriousness
with which it handles human vulnerability. The danger is extremely real, and
as things go awry (as they are wont to do), the audience is able to feel the
pain alongside everyone on screen. In a world of PG-13 action films, cartoon
violence seems to prevail. Here, when a person falls down for good, it rips
you apart. <em>Unstoppable</em> nabbed a PG-13 rating, proving you can make action
that hurts and get it past the MPAA.</p>

<p>Huge kudos to Chris Lebenzon and Robert Duffy who edited the piece. It’s not
easy to get the right kind of tension with as much camera movement as Scott
uses, but they were remarkably up to the challenge. The film has its quiet
moments which pull us to the edge of our seats, and the final leg of the
pursuit is a stunning bit of old-school action. In general, rail action is
something of a throwback. There is a blatant message of blue-collar
workmanship, and the men and women (I should mention Rosario Dawson holds
things down on the mic as yardmaster Connie Hooper) who keep rail travel
running feel as ancient as the tracks on which they drive. Of course, when a
train goes out of control, all the MBAs in the world couldn’t save us from
ourselves.</p>

<p>Tony Scott may be the closest thing we have to a backlot director. He works
hard, he works fast, and his films are successful enough (extremely
successful, actually) to allow him to make the films he wants. He wields a
massive, captive audience and his films have long been parables for the
current American landscape. Sometimes, it takes a foreigner to expose who we
are. Whatever it is that Scott has to say about us, his technique and his
message have never matched up as beautifully as in <em>Unstoppable</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ProAppsLionArtworkOutline.jpg" title="Pro Apps on Lion" />
Ever since Apple removed the word “Computer” from it’s letterhead in 2007, gloom and doom pundits have been worried the company would eventually stop providing service for its professional users (read filmmakers, designers, photographers, etc.). Another alarming bit of news came last week when Apple discontinued its Xserve line of OS X based servers. Even though Apple has consistently updated their pro hardware in the years since it became primarily a mobile device company, this move definitely gives creative professionals reason for pause.</p>

<p>It gets worse if you look at where Apple’s Pro Apps, specifically Final Cut Studio, have been all this time. Don’t get me wrong, Final Cut overall has seen plenty of advances over the years, and it is still the editing choice of a growing number of filmmakers. However, there are major stumbling blocks that hold it back from being the <em>perfect</em> post production tool. Recently, a user <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/11/jobs-reportedly-says-final-cut-update-coming-early-next-year/">e-mailed Steve Jobs</a> asking for a Final Cut roadmap, receiving in return assurance that an update is coming “early next year”. Here is my wish list for what I believe would be most useful for creative professionals.</p>

<h2 id="unified-interface">Unified Interface</h2>

<p>One thing that Final Cut Studio’s developers have been scared to change, and rightfully so, is the overall interface of the editing program. The proof that this is ground worth treading softly on is in the release of iMovie ’08, which stripped down the consumer software’s interface to the bare minimum. Relying more on clips smashed up against one another than on a “timeline” metaphor, Apple alienated tons of users who couldn’t grasp the change from previous versions of the software. In ensuing releases, they have slowly added the lost features back. However, the damage was done, and you can’t reinvent the wheel overnight for software that powers an industry. But how stagnant has Final Cut’s interface been?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/03_ambit_fullscreen-300x232.jpg" title="Final Cut Pro 1.2.5 Screenshot" />To the left is a still from Final Cut 1.2.5 running on Mac OS 9 posted to <a href="http://kenstone.net">kenstone.net</a> in early 2001. The interface today is almost identical. Functionally, there is no comparison. HD, multiclipping, Color integration, improved plugin extensibility…the list goes on and on. Final Cut 7 is a thousand times the editor that FCP 1.2.5 was. And yet the basic design of it survives a decade and a major OS redesign. In general, none of this would matter if it weren’t for the announcement of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, which adds new multi-touch gestures on the OS level and highlights full- screen, iPad-like apps delivered through the new Mac App Store.</p>

<p>What does it mean to say that Final Cut Pro 7 is a modern, powerful application stuck in an OS 9 body? For starters, Final Cut relies heavily on multiple windows floating over the desktop. Get rid of any window and you can see the desktop behind it. Oddly, even the “standard” Final Cut display will leave a little bit of the desktop peeking out (in the lower right corner of the screen). This has long been a Mac-ish concept, so much so that when Adobe opted to introduce a more Windows-like neutral background in Photoshop CS3, users sparred a bit over the de-Mac-ification of the application. As <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/06/future_photoshop_ui_changes.html">Adobe’s John Nack</a> pointed out back in 2008, Apple’s own applications have a bit of schizophrenia when it comes to interface:</p>

<blockquote><p>What about Apple’s own applications, as they would be presumably be the definition of Mac-like, right? I noticed a couple of things:</p><p>* The pro video apps (Final Cut Pro, Motion, Color, DVD Studio Pro) configure their windows/panels to take over one’s screen completely.<br />* Aperture and iPhoto put all the UI into a window &amp; optionally take over the screen in a dedicated full-screen mode.<br />* The iLife and iWork apps (Keynote, Pages, iWeb) all feature a UI approach that marries together content &amp; interface in a single window.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are a few additions to his list (all of which stands true after two and a half years):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Soundtrack Pro and Motion take up one whole window with tabbed toolbars that can be “torn” off into new windows/panels.</li>
  <li>DVD Studio Pro mostly consists of one big window with the same tabbed toolbar interface, though out of the box it also has extra panels which are their own windows.</li>
  <li>Color is really an island unto itself; it fills the screen completely in one big window with a much different interface based around “rooms”.</li>
  <li>Compressor is a mess; it bunches panels together slapdash. Even simple transcoding tasks become a hassle because you have to deal with so many windows. The same goes for Cinema Tools, which has far too many windows for a simple database application. Basically, everything needs an overhaul, and we can only hope that’s what’s been taking them so long to deploy a fully updated evolution of the Final Cut Studio suite. I don’t know what it should look like, but it probably won’t look anything like iMovie. I doubt the trusty “sequence” is going anywhere, but given the major changes Lion is bringing, I wouldn’t be surprised if we start to see a new fullscreen interface with a streamlined window configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s that? You say that Apple has consistently updated Final Cut Studio every year or so? Wrong. Which brings me too…</p>

<h2 id="media-studio-pro-5-please">[Media] Studio Pro 5, Please</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sad-DVD-Studio-Pro-300x222.jpg" title="Sad DVD Studio Pro" />I used to repeat the following trope to aspiring filmmakers who balked at Final Cut Studio’s $1000 (or more) price tag: “You need Final Cut Pro to edit (i.e. eat), but DVD Studio Pro alone is worth the price tag.” That <em>was</em> true. DVD Studio Pro 4, the product that ships with Final Cut Studio today, was introduced at NAB 2005. Sure, it has received minor updates since then (the last one was in July of 2009), but even a conservative programmer would agree that five years is appallingly long to not have an X.0 release. Beyond that, its name is no longer relevant; content creators still <em>use</em> DVDs but it’s not how consumers get most of their media. At the very least, it’s a format on the run, being outperformed by Blu- Ray and downloadable/streaming content.</p>

<p>So what gives? No Mac ships with a Blu-Ray drive, which was presumably the holdup during the “format war” with HD-DVD in 2007. Apple wasn’t ready to throw its weight behind either format, instead waiting to see who would win, but Blu-Ray soundly won that battle in 2008 yet Apple still hasn’t shipped any high-capacity optical drives. The newest Final Cut Studio allows users to burn Blu-Ray discs, but not to design them with the ease and comprehensiveness of DVD Studio Pro. Instead, customizable menus require a good deal of coding, and even then the control scheme is lackluster. The only product on the market that allows you to author Blu-Ray discs with any kind of creativity is Adobe’s Encore, which doesn’t play too nice with Apple’s Final Cut codecs.</p>

<p>It gets worse. Physical media will be around for a long time as a distribution pipe (if I had to guess, I’d say at least a decade, if not two), but the writing is on the wall: downloadable media is the way of the future. Apple knows this better than anyone, given the revolutionary stance iTunes has taken on the matter. Last year, Apple introduced iTunes LP and iTunes Extra added features for music and movies on the iTunes Store, respectively. These functions basically feel like the interface of a DVD menu, except they exist only within the the user’s music/movie download on his or her computer. If the entire DVD experience is going to be digital, without physical media, will Apple be able to deliver an application to creative professionals? Right now, you have to be a coder to get anything done with these features. (Don’t get me started on creating slick HTML5 apps for the Boxee Box and GoogleTV; the same argument applies.) Hopefully [Media] Studio Pro 5 will help us deliver content wherever the eyeballs (and, yes, checkbooks) are.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="put-the-app-store-to-good-use">Put the App Store to Good Use</h2>

<p>While it may not seem feasible to deliver Final Cut Studio through the forthcoming Mac App Store given its gigabyte girth, there is always room for third party enhancement via instant downloads. Final Cut has an active plugin community, and it would be great if all of those plugins could be managed through the App Store. It’s currently unclear whether the App Store will be able to be used for plugins, but it could be one day.</p>

<p>Imagine you could access a plugin App Store from within Final Cut. You come across a problem in need of a solution; you would immediately be able to browse through options for your specific need. Many companies offer plugin packs to cover the cost of delivering the software to users. With a plugin App Store, instead of 50 plugins for $100, 49 of which never get used, users could drop $2-$5 a pop for exactly what they need. Better still, when enhancements to a given plugin come in the form of an update, simply run all of the updates from Final Cut. The same goes for Motion textures, DVD Studio Pro templates, or Compressor presets. The market would be massive. Time will tell if Apple wants to allow the Pro Apps to play in the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="refine-the-menial">Refine the Menial</h2>

<p>Editing, like all creative pursuits, is an action of the mind. Great editors can find the perfect way to bump a series of pictures up against one another in order to convey an intellectual or emotional concept. As my junior high school music teacher told me when I said my saxophone was a piece of crap, “If John Coltrane walked in here right now and picked up that sax, he’d still be John Coltrane.” Tools don’t make art. That being said, there are a ton of niggling tasks that are a part of any post workflow, and Final Cut makes them a nightmare sometimes.</p>

<p>Clients (unlike artists) don’t want to know the inner workings of editing software. They just want their stuff. Here’s a list of things that will make it easier for all of us to get things done faster and, more importantly, right on the first try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better frame accuracy when running up, down and cross-conversions via the AJA-KONA, including the ability to change the offset by a half frame for 60p-to-30i outputs.</li>
  <li>In line with the above, Deck Control schemes tailored to actual decks, not just Manufacturer+Frame Rate. (I have never had a problem with frame accuracy on Avid; not once.)</li>
  <li>Timecode display during capture and output of any media. I want to see it from across the room while I sip my Double Gulp.</li>
  <li>More intuitive audio output configurations, please. It’s a pain to “right-click in the gray space to the left of the sequence but before you hit the green ball” and even worse to say that over the phone to a client who has to deliver an 8-track Quicktime.</li>
  <li>Better Media Management. I’ve never seen a project completely come over to a new hard drive with render files. Never.</li>
  <li>Deliver on Final Cut Server’s promise.</li>
  <li>Fix Compressor. We should be able to export multiple clips in multiple formats to multiple directories without ctrl-clicking until our fingers fall off. Also, the interface is still way too confusing.</li>
  <li>Put Color in Final Cut where it belongs. While the picture-lock-to-color-correct workflow makes plenty of sense, it’s a holdover from tape-based workflows. Creatives shouldn’t have to choose if they are going to color now or later.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roll-out">Roll Out</h2>

<p>Everyone has a different use case for Final Cut Pro, and no two workflows look alike. If Final Cut changed anything in the post production game, it made it easier for those who have no workflow whatsoever to jump in and start making movies, more than any other piece of editing software before it or since. The digital revolution needs software that gets out of the way and allows filmmakers to explore their wildest creative thoughts. Many of my requests fit my workflow, but I’m one in a million. Nonetheless, I think this wish list is a decent start. I’d love to hear what the rest of you would like to see in Final Cut’s next release in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Movies_IngloriousBasterds-300x187.png" alt="Boxee Box Interface" /></p>

<p>When Avner Ronen took the stage at Irving Plaza last night, he was met with whoops and hollers, requests to break into dance (to which he eventually acquiesced) and the clanking of PBR tall boys. He is not your average CEO. The setting for the launch of the aptly named Boxee Box, was perfect for a company as scrappy and ideologically cocksure as Boxee.</p>

<p>In a mere three years, the Tel Aviv and New York based startup has batted down nearly every one of its software competitors only to enter a hardware arms race against Apple and Google. Ronen has become something of a web video evangelist, famously sparring online with mogul Mark Cuban over the future of television. Now, he’s taking his company from the original free, hackable app that turns any computer into a net-centric media player with a slick interface, to store shelves in time for the holiday season. The product of a partnership with D-Link, the Boxee Box is here and the software is finally out of beta.</p>

<p>But what’s the big deal?</p>

<p>The Boxee Box brings what was once a very nerdy experience to the masses. Installing Boxee may never have been that hard, but hooking your computer up to your television, along with the audio, and figuring out how to control it from your couch was where the less tech-savvy stumbled. Now, it’s as easy as plugging in the box.</p>

<p>What sets the Boxee Box apart from its competitors is its ability to playback non-streaming media in almost every single format imaginable. As Ronen quipped, “If it has 3 letters in its name, we can play it.” With two USB ports on the back, users can attach massive storage for all of their videos and music. He played a 1080p x264 video off of an SD Card and it looked beautiful. Details are a bit thin right now, but Ronen did mention from the stage that users will be able to share that storage with other computers via Wifi.</p>

<p>Then there are the big partners, Netflix and Hulu. These announcements Avner coyly saved for the end of his presentation. Netflix, who has been a longtime partner with Boxee, will be coming later this year to the Boxee Box with a completely revamped interface and HD streaming. It appears that right now, users with a Boxee Box can still access the old Netflix app, but not in HD, yet. Hulu, who has a contentious history with Boxee, is bringing their paid Hulu Plus service sometime early next year.  “It’s true, we’re friends now,” Avner fawned, “Next up, Middle East Peace.”</p>

<p>All of that aside, and it’s a lot to set aside, the most interesting part about this product launch has nothing to do with their partners or their content on day one, but with their pragmatic view of web video and how it fits into the living room. The Boxee Box now has a brand new Webkit browser built in conjunction with Intel (who provides the system- on-a-chip inside). If you want, you can view an entire webpage with video playing on it, using the remote’s directional-pad to push a mouse pointer across the screen to get what you need. The thing is, Avner sounded downright sour that a browser is accessible through the Boxee Box. “It works, it’s not pretty, but it’s there if you need it.”</p>

<p>That’s not all he had to say. “Browser on a TV kind of sucks.” This sounds like a direct shot at GoogleTV, whose demo showed off how much browser they could fit onto a television. So if the browser concept sucks, what about apps? “Idea of apps kind of sucks.” It’s not that apps on your TV is a bad idea (especially since Boxee basically relies on them), it’s that there are too many APIs and Development Kits and platforms out there already; Boxee doesn’t want to become another language for developers to learn.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Boxee_HomeScreen-300x168.png" alt="Boxee Box Home Screen" /></p>

<p>The workaround? HTML5. Ronen explained that developers can build some really cool HTML5 video apps which the Boxee Box will be able to access. He demoed a New York Times app that looked great; no one would ever question its code provenance. Given that HTML is an open standard, this makes it easier for developers to get in line. GoogleTV supports HTML5 apps as well, so it will be easier for content creators and channels to develop once and deploy to both platforms. The AppleTV does not do this, but Avner said he hopes they’ll start soon so that content creators can be on any television.</p>

<p>The Boxee Box is a very nice offering for consumers, and it is priced competitively to move a lot of units this holiday season. At $199 it’s twice the price of an AppleTV and $100 less than the Logitech Revue, GoogleTV’s flagship device. The thing it, it does (at least) twice as much as the Apple TV and probably <em>more</em> than the Logitech Revue. For content creators, this means yet another barrier has been broken down. To get your content onto Boxee is only slightly more difficult than getting a podcast into iTunes. The more homes with a Boxee Box, the more eyeballs for content creators to reach.</p>

<p>I didn’t get the chance to actually use a Boxee Box (though I’m told I’ll have the opportunity soon) so I can’t speak to its actual quality. I’ve been using the software since it was in alpha, and if you told me three years down the line they’d be in retail stores up against Apple and Google, I would have said you were nuts. Yet here we are. It could very well be a flop. However, if you’re a content creator looking for a new way to reach audiences, there has never been a better time to get your media into the homes of the masses. Whatever poison you pick, the Boxee Box appears to be another great option in a year that looks poised to be a hallmark one for streaming video.</p>

/EnterTheVoidStill-300x224.jpg" alt="Enter the Void Still" /></a>Last week, esteemed film writers
Anne Thompson, Leonard Maltin and Eric Kohn <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/11/05/three-critics-anne-thompson-
leonard-maltin-eric-kohn-3d/">posted the
transcript</a> of a conversation in which the trio discuss the
relevance, artistry and bankability of 3D cinema. It’s definitely worth a
read, especially given the unique perspectives of Thompson as industry
insider, Maltin as historian and Kohn as cinephile (I’m oversimplifying, each
one fills all of those roles at varying points, but the transcript makes it
clear whose strengths lie where.) I’d like to throw my opinion into the mix on
the subject of 3D as it stands today.[pullquote]</p>

<h2 id="d-like-any-other-visual-technology-is-only-as-good-as-its-output">3D, like any other visual technology, is only as good as its output.</h2>

<p>[/pullquote]</p>

<p>Most of their conversation is well-trodden ground, the predictable tropes
we’ve been hearing all year. Maltin opens “3-D alone isn’t enough anymore.
We’ve had several 3-D flops. Take <em>Clash of the Titans</em>. Say you’re at Warner
Bros. and you have, on the one hand, a guy saying, ‘This 3-D quality sucks,’
but then another says, ‘Yes, but look at how much money we made this weekend
with it anyway.’” The accepted wisdom is that 3D is a gimmick that exists only
to squeeze extra pennies out of movie-goers. True, but not really true.</p>

<p>3D, like any other visual technology, is only as good as its output. A movie
camera is no good without someone to work it, preferably someone with a vision
of how to advance cinema. Whatever you think about <em>Avatar</em>, James Cameron is
that person, he is the artist who has the drive and determination to see 3D
flourish as a legitimate art form not just today, but for its next century.
The film isn’t a talking point because it found a new way to press audiences
for revenue, it’s a part of history because when we look at the timeline of
cinema, we can point to the 2009 release of <em>Avatar</em> and say “something
changed here”.</p>

<p>But, and this is a big but, James Cameron is not the artist who will break
down the barriers between Big Hollywood and indie visionaries. As much of a
technological wiz as he is, his evangelism goes only so far as the most basic,
plastic issues of filmmaking. What we need is someone who can take the
technology, take the buzz and wrangle it into a viable artistic movement. We
need someone to save 3D from being destroyed by the Hollywood money machine.</p>

<p>I have heard chatter that Gaspar Noe wanted to make his psychedelic <em>Enter the
Void</em> in 3D, a pronouncement that sounds like a self-serving bit of
braggadocio. (It also elicits giggles from the peanut gallery given the film’s
literal climax.) Wracking my brain, I couldn’t think of a film that could have
done more for the format than <em>Void</em>. The camera bobs, weaves, floats and
devolves into light-soaked wormholes, spindly arms reaching out to the
audience and taking hold. As an experience, it is wildly immersive. For some,
it may be unwatchable, but the folks who can make it through all the way and
laud it are exactly the sort of people who need to be jolted into 3D
acceptance.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to address the argument that 3D is a gimmick. It should
be noted that the same argument was made for CGI, CinemaScope, color film,
sync sound and cinema itself in each of their respective infancies. We grow
and we learn over time. It is an offensive, classist argument akin to
“animation is only for kids”. No crossover filmmaker has yet come along to
embrace 3D strongly enough to make it artistically interesting, but give it
time to grow. 3D will only be here to stay if the indie, arthouse community
embraces it. Time to wait and see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cannesjoy718.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/10/cannesjoy718-300x224.jpg" alt="Still from My Joy" /></a>Film festival coverage is never
easy, especially when for 4 weeks, as is the case for the New York Film
Festival, critics and journos meet daily to view films that will be screened
to the public as soon as a few days away, as little as a few hours later. The
task is, to say the least, daunting. Which is why I have barely covered
anything from the fest. Now that I’ve thoroughly digested my viewing (about a
dozen films) I can share a few thoughts about them with you. This first batch
is for films that fell outside of my normal viewing habits. It’s a cop-out to
say these are films I didn’t “get”. It would be more accurate to say they just
didn’t jibe with my tastes, but I have an obligation to share with you what I
mean by that. So this first group could be called “Stuff you Will Probably
Never See, but Wouldn’t Mind Reading About”. Without further ado:</p>

<p><strong><em>Robinson in Ruins</em></strong><br />
Cinema’s powers are so diverse that perhaps we forget it can be used in
academic discourse outside of the realm of fiction, documentary and industrial
work. <em>Robinson in Ruins</em> is an essay film by Patrick Keiller with a simple
premise. The footage you are looking at and the long running narration are the
work and notes of one Robinson which was found near a trash can. The film is
the assumed result of his work in his absence.</p>

<p>The film is a lengthy diatribe on the history of capitalism, it’s reshaping of
earthly pleasures and, err, the changing spatial layout of environs. The
camera never moves, instead always facing forward at the world it is
examining. Analyses and parables are read to us by Vanessa Redgrave whose
soothing, disembodied narration makes the placid imagery far more palatable.
The words are dense and the ideas are high-minded; I would love to read the
entire narration in pamphlet form. Which brings us to the fundamental
challenge of a work like this: keeping the viewer visually engaged while the
brain is being stimulated in so many other places.</p>

<p>There is a reason why the printed page still exists; there is a reason why we
invented the highlighter, for linear and deconstruct-able learning. Which
isn’t to say Keiller’s film isn’t a valid way to access and stimulate various
receptors. On the contrary, it has the ability to suck you in, aggravate and
stir up nearly all of your mental faculties. Younger, more malleable minds,
perhaps, would benefit from this method the most. It is a beautiful and
endearing use of cinema, even if it is one my solidified mind has trouble
letting in. What is the film “about”? I couldn’t tell you if I tried (and I
think I just did).</p>

<p><strong><em>Film Socialisme</em></strong><br />
Ah, Jean-Luc Godard, where can I even begin? Challenging is a word that I will
use to describe the director’s last few films, and I don’t intend that to mean
“incomprehensible”. More a sense of bravado, a line being drawn in the sand,
an outright playground after school while your buddies whoop you on kind of
challenge; a duel, a battle. Will you take him on, take him down, call him on
his bullshit and recognize his artistry? I, for one, will not. It’s a cop-out,
I agree.</p>

<p><em>Film Socialisme</em> centers around characters on a boat who speak various
languages, mostly the director’s native French. For the English release of the
film, Godard dictated that the subtitles be translated in part, not in full,
resulting in what the director calls Navajo subtitles. Words are omitted, most
nouns get to stick around, and modifiers smash up against each other. In
short, Anglophones and Francophones are seeing two different films. Or are
they? I never felt lost on account of the stylized text. My limited French
kicked in and noticed the difference between what was said and what was
written, and got the point of the dialogue anyway. Perhaps the French speakers
are missing out.</p>

<p>Where one can easily get lost is in the film’s content. The ramblings of
undeveloped characters, people whose relationships and essence are never
explored, are the film’s entire makeup. It can be tough to follow what is
happening, where we are and why, but not so hard. You just need to work at it.
That is common for post-Dziga-Vertov Godard. Also common in his work, and more
of a sticking point for me, is anti-semitism. Godard’s vitriol is mostly
reserved for Israel, making his anti-Jewish flourishes more innocuous and
socially acceptable (he is an avowed anti-Zionist). Is it anti-Semitic to
criticize Israel? It depends, and it’s tough tell with Godard. At some point
the denial of a Jewish homeland has to be squared with how you feel about the
Jewish people, but so long as there is a perceived debate over whether Jews
are a people or a religion (we’re a people, there’s no debate) this is a
question that will probably go unanswered in the arts community. What is less
nebulous is his pointing out of Hollywood, long the creative enemy of his
cinema, as a Jewish machination, a Protocols of the Elders of Burbank of
sorts. He brings it up briefly, unmotivated enough to barely give us pause. Is
Godard anti-Semitic? That discussion will continue for decades.</p>

<p><strong>**If we separate his cinema from his politics, something that undermines his essence and intent, what are we left with? As always, a brilliant exercise in form. The Godard of the 1960s, the one many refuse to let go of, explored form alongside his Nouvelle Vauge colleagues, within the confines of narrative, until eventually he broke off and explored form for it’s own sake. After all these years, he continues to prove that cinema, both visually and aurally, corporeally and plastically, is a space barely excavated. He still possesses a childlike curiosity, digging his fingers in the mud just to see what comes up.  It may only be worms, but that he rooted around in the first place is what sets him apart. (That metaphor doesn’t hold so much water, I realize, since Godard knows exactly what he is doing. Still, there is a childlike sense of discovery in his work.)<br />
**<em>My Joy</em></strong><br />
And finally, a film I not only understood (to the best of my non-Eastern Bloc
capabilities) but outright hated. <em>My Joy</em> is the sort of film you expect to
see at a cynical, upper crust, hoity-toitety film festival. In other words, it
is exactly the kind of film that has given the New York Film Festival its
reputation as a pinky-in-the-air, self-ingratiating film education given from
on high. (I’d like to note that I don’t agree with this viewpoint, but it’s
out there and it’s something the NYFF lives with and, frankly, revels in. Who
wouldn’t want to be called “too smart”?) Director Serhiy Loznytsya could have
gotten to the point much faster by saying “Russia is an unforgiving, shitty
place,” but instead we sit through this film that jumps through time,
characters and motivation.</p>

<p>To say that it is a dreary film doesn’t even begin to describe it. Families
are murdered, the downtrodden get downtroddener and plot lines come and go at
the drop of an ushanka. We follow Georgi, a charismatic truck driver with a
few secrets behind his eyes, through the depressed economy of his nation. He
picks up a hitchhiker, tries to save  prostitute from a life on the street,
and gets ambushed by countryside bums. It is not a good couple of days.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that this film has a clear message about where Russia finds
itself in the world today, but that is part, if not, all, of the problem. It’s
“message, message, message” not “story, story, story”. I don’t care, but not
because I am heartless; because I am not made to care. If this is a parable,
we should be getting story first. And form? Not impressive enough to overcome
the narrative missteps within this film. Perhaps if I were Russian, perhaps if
I had a horse in this race, I would think it a brilliant deconstruction of a
culture. But I’m not, and so I’ve got nothing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/10/hereafter-movie.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10
/hereafter-movie-300x226.jpg" alt="Hereafter Still" /></a>Hereafter</em> is Clint Eastwood’s
latest soapbox, proving that the octogenarian director has neither lost his
flare for the dramatic nor his moralistic pulpit. In the film’s opening
moments, he provides perhaps his most technically resplendent sequence,
executing a massive natural disaster, a tsunami, with a camera that whips and
winds with the current of an overflowing sea. Yet from that point on, the
curmudgeonly Eastwood we have come to know in the past decade drags out a
boring tale of love, loss and the afterlife. It is, to say the least, a
snooze.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of one of the easiest ways of duping an audience into
thinking they are watching a tale of emotional discovery,  <em>Hereafter</em> relies
on intertwining, seemingly unrelated plot lines. There are three in this film.
George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a San Francisco based psychic trying to lay low
after a successful run as a supernatural healer. Marie LeLay (Cécile De
France) is a Parisian news anchor (and Blackberry spokeswoman) whose extreme
brush with death leads her to put her career on hold. Finally, Marcus and
Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) are precocious twins who try to keep their
deadbeat mother in shape lest they be swept off by child services. The trick
is to keep the plot moving forward in each story line, usually at the expense
of character development. The trouble is that no one plot stands out above the
rest, and their collision at the end is completely nonsensical.</p>

<p>Viewers may not be surprised to learn that Steven Spielberg played the role of
Executive Producer on this film. Given his penchant for dabbling in projects
under his purview, I wouldn’t be surprised if the aforementioned opening
sequence didn’t have at least a little bit of his direction. As the tsunami
breaks through an entire civilization, our perspective remains steady,
changing only as emotionally necessary. Given the scope of the destruction, it
sounds simpler than it actually is to pull this off. It is a powerhouse
sequence, that is until a teddy bear turns into some kind of god-like
talisman. Ironically, this is when it turns into a disaster film.</p>

<p><em>Hereafter</em> also hinges on a very Spielbergian concept: heartache. Given that
we know this is a story dealing with life after death, Eastwood immediately
plays on our emotions. He lets us know that someone, if not everyone, will die
before our eyes, but not before we gain an emotional connection to them. Those
who have vilified Spielberg for this in the past will go on the attack if only
for the excruciating introduction of Marcus and Jason, whose dreary lives are
almost sure to end in horror. To make matters worse, for all the shoes that
could have dropped on these people, for all the monsters lurking in closets,
the one we end up with is eminently banal.</p>

<p>I’m not going to talk about performances; they’re all serviceable but none are
stellar. Now it’s time to turn attention to perhaps the most surprising
misstepper in this hard-to-love film: Peter Morgan. One of Britain’s top
A-listers, it’s hard to believe that the drivel on screen came from his gifted
pen. His fatal mistake is that the afterlife is dealt with as both a religious
and a scientific reality. He doesn’t go to any lengths to defend either
viewpoint. For example, a “scientist and atheist” in the film provides
incontrovertible evidence that there is in fact life after death, but we are
never allowed to look at that evidence. Moreover, we are never given the
boundaries of this world of the dead. Instead, it remains unknown and
uninteresting throughout. This kind of film requires the grounding of Science
Fiction, a suspension of disbelief that is entirely unemotional. Morgan did
not provide.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Hereafter</em> falls flat for its weak story. Clint Eastwood remains
an icon and a talented, steady director. When George takes on a client of his
brother’s (Richard Kind as the client, Jay Mohr as his brother) the scene is
dark, quiet and moody. He plays in the dark and can build a beautiful scene
out of the thinnest of dialogue. In the end, however, it isn’t enough to
overcome a story that will have you unintentionally rolling on the floor by
the overwrought ending. “Is this for real?” was my internal monologue as the
music crescendoed and credits took over. Alarmingly, yes, it is.</p>

<p>If you haven’t heard of the film <em>Marwencol</em> yet, it’s time to perk up. You can <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/03/14/sxsw-review-marwencol/">read my review from this year’s SXSW</a> to become fully acclimated. The documentary, which follows Mark Hogancamp and his 1/6th scale Belgian village whose name is the same as the film, has been winding its way through the festival circuit all year and is finally ready for its theatrical debut. It opens today in New York City, and with it came director Jeff Malmberg.</p>

<p><em>Marwencol</em> marks Jeff’s directorial debut. He was worked as an editor for a number of years, but it wasn’t until he started cutting documentaries that he found his true calling. He took some time out of his schedule to sit and chat with me about the film and his burgeoning career. More than anything, it seems, Jeff loves to talk about Mark, the star of his film. Don’t take my work for it though. Click on through and listen to Jeff’s story. He talks about how he came to make this film, the state of documentary today, and why he chose a narrative structure for <em>Marwencol</em> that some others may have shied away from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/venicestillhere718b.jpg" alt="I'm Still Here Still" /></p>

<p>The cat is out of the bag: Casey Affleck <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/movies/17affleck.html">admitted in no uncertain terms that his</a> <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/movies/17affleck.html">I’m Still Here</a></em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/movies/17affleck.html">and all of its public antics were part of a (not so) elaborate hoax.</a> The film follows Affleck’s brother-in-law Joaquin Phoenix as he retires from acting and tries his hand as a hip-hop artist. I saw the film last week but never ended up writing a review. Now that we all know the truth, I’d like to point out a few reasons why the entire project was a wild misstep for those involved.</p>

<h5 id="it-wasnt-a-great-hoax">1. It wasn’t a great hoax.</h5>

<p>At no point throughout the two years devoted to creating the character of dark and disturbed Joaquin/J.P. did <em>anyone</em> not consider the possibility that this was all a hoax. While there was a great deal of coverage on his retirement from acting after a meteoric rise, the story seemed to always be followed by another one about how fake the whole event seemed. Beyond that, what was realized in the execution of this joke? Nothing. At least Jerry Springer was able to tap into the American psyche. What does J.P. reveal about anything?</p>

<h5 id="it-wasnt-a-great-movie">2. It wasn’t a great movie.</h5>

<p>Even accepting the film as fiction doesn’t make up for the scheme. It is clunky and corny, manipulative and, at times, boring. Even at its most revealing moments, we are thrust back into the insanity of J.P.’s devolution, never really getting to see something more human emerge from this confused shell of a man. The film’s ending implies that we should feel for him with an overlong shot of him submerging in Panamanian waters, but instead the film feels truncated, stalled. Narratively, for a fake film, one could do a lot better.</p>

<h5 id="it-was-too-childish">3. It was too childish.</h5>

<p>The most talked about moments of the film involve Phoenix snorting cocaine and ordering hookers as if they were so many pizzas. This clued most people into the fake-ness of the film, though not because we would like to think better of what movie-stars do with their hard earned cash. It broke through the facade because it was a childish scene, the kind of lifestyle prepubescent minds <em>think</em> rock stars would have. It felt put on. And then there’s the scene where a costar takes a dump on Joaquin’s face. Enough said.</p>

<h5 id="they-revealed-the-truth-too-soon">4. They revealed the truth too soon.</h5>

<p>It should have been clear, for a long time, that there would be creative consequences for making this film. For whatever reason, Affleck and Phoenix decided to tell the world it was a documentary and run with it, even through screenings at the Venice and Toronto Film Fests. Fine. Why not run with it a bit longer? Andy Kaufman took his Jerry Lawler prank to the grave and it remained a secret for a decade after his passing. Charlie Kaufman (no relation) allowed himself to be nominated for two Oscars as both himself and the fictional Donald Kaufman just to keep up appearances for the meta <em>Adaptation</em>. If this was all about audience engagement, trying to get people to unravel their hinted puzzle, why not let us all stew in it for some time? There is a simple answer: the film got terrible reviews and both of them would like to get back to work.</p>

<h5 id="they-could-have-made-the-same-film-without-deception">5. They could have made the same film without deception.</h5>

<p>When you get down to the nuts and bolts of the whole operation, the public appearances and tabloid press version of this story stands separately from the film itself. They could have made the exact same film without the put-ons. Do they think audiences are so stupid that they wouldn’t be able to differentiate the Joaquin character from the real Joaquin? This gets back to this really not being such a great hoax in the first place.</p>

<h5 id="the-performance-was-marred-by-the-whole-escapade">6. The performance was marred by the whole escapade.</h5>

<p>In his explanation for the hoax, Affleck refers to Phoenix’s performance in the film as his best yet. That’s debatable, though the character is weighed down by the film’s concept. If you watch closely, there are actually many Joaquins on display; he’s a schizophrenic character. His arc, as it were, has more of an ebb and flow than any real direction. It’s not easy to stay in character for two years, but then again it’s not easy to pull off the best performance of your career.</p>

<h5 id="the-new-york-times-reveal-is-horseshit">7. The New York Times reveal is horseshit.</h5>

<p>While I don’t think he should have revealed that it was a hoax so soon, there are a million ways Casey Affleck could have copped to this that would have been more explosive, more fun than “over a meat-free, cheese-free vegetable sandwich” with Michael Cieply (no offense). Phoenix will be on Letterman next Wednesday, an obvious place for a reveal. They could have showed up at a theater to explain things away; they could have gone out with a bang. Instead, Affleck sounds like a wet noodle in the Grey Lady: “I never intended to trick anybody…The idea of a quote, hoax, unquote, never entered my mind.” Oh please, pick up a newspaper or read a blog, the word hoax was used in nearly every piece of reportage on this film for years now.</p>

<p>I went into the screening of <em>Catfish</em> as most viewers are likely to: without a clue as to what was about to unfurl. The recent promos for the film, depicting a <em>Blair Witch</em>-esque odyssey, are unlikely to clear things up. But that’s the fun of it. It’s an oddball little documentary with a weird title and a twist that ought to be protected. So what can one even say about it without pissing on the parade? That it’s a highly enjoyable, highly suspect slice of life investigation.</p>

<p>Right up front you’ll meet Nev Schulman, a New York-based photographer and brother of filmmaker Ariel (Rel) Schulman, who directs the film along with Henry Joost. He begins receiving paintings of his photos from an 8 year old girl on Facebook, Abby. Her talented brushstrokes of his inspired photos have earned Abby both a reputation and a living; the paintings are sold online and at Michigan galleries where she lives. Amazed at the power of the social network, that his work could inspire someone he has never had reason to come in contact with, lead Nev to reach out to Abby and her family. He meets her mother and sister through Facebook and becomes entwined in her social circle.</p>

<p>It is when Nev “meets” Megan, Abby’s older sister, that things take a turn. A good looking romantic and, let’s face it, a nerd, Nev finds himself quickly falling for Megan, and elevates the relationship from an online rendezvous to phone calls and naughty texts. They chat online constantly and she even records a few songs for him. Or does she? When she uploads a song in under a half hour of the request and e-mails it to him, Nev gets suspicious of her abilities. In an online stakeout, Nev, Rel and Henry scour the web to find empirical proof of Megan and Abby’s existence, coming up short. So they decide that they must, for the sake of the film, head to Michigan and confront the family head on.</p>

<p><em>Catfish</em> joins a long list of documentaries of dubious provenance this year. Banksy’s <em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em> was supposedly directed by the mysterious street artist, though many of the pieces of that film seem staged, or at the very least provoked. Casey Affleck and Joaquin Phoenix are unsuccessfully billing their <em>I’m Still Here</em> as an actuality while the film has hoax written all over it (even in an opening title card). And here we have Joost and Schulman’s work. By the end, the pieces fit perhaps too perfectly; the narrative is so clear, following an Aristotelean arc so closely it seems as though it must be staged. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Look around the world for the absurd, for stories that seem like something out of the imagination, impossible. You hear about it all of the time; why shouldn’t something like that happen to a small group of filmmakers? It’s possible, at the very least.</p>

<p>However, looking beyond whether or not you believe in it, we can still look at the film objectively, as a movie. In a season that will likely be dominated by David Fincher’s <em>The Social Network</em>, referred to colloquially as “The Facebook Movie”, I think <em>Catfish</em> is far more deserving of that nickname. It is a testament to our current trend of virtual self; an analysis of what we will allow ourselves to not only share, but to feel publicly. Like it or not, we all live in a virtual world of our own design; posting, tweeting, liking, etc. When that brushes up against the real world, the meat space, and we don’t like what we see, we all have to find a way to cope, to reconcile both worlds. Joost and Schulman have delivered a film that, even if not entirely true (though I think it is) serves as an excellent parable for our current obsession with the virtual. It will no doubt be the more lasting “Facebook Movie” of 2010.</p>

/louisstill-300x184.jpg" alt="Louis Still" /></a>It almost seems unfair, at this point,
to post a review of Dan Pritzker’s silent film <em>Louis</em>. It’s not that I
haven’t seen the the film, I have, but I’m not positive that I’ve actually
heard it. Featuring a flowing musical score penned by Jazz’s presiding dean,
Wynton Marsalis, the film will be on tour through the last week of August with
live accompaniment by Marsalis, pianist Cecile Licad and a ten-piece ensemble.
If the phrase “concert film” has been claimed by documentarians, then the only
other term I could think of for <em>Louis</em> is “event film”. Recounting a reverie
of the early life of trumpet great Louis Armstrong, the film’s five live
showings will be nothing short of a grand event.</p>

<p>Pritzker and writers Derick Martini, Steve Martini and David Rothschild came
up with a gimmick film, a riff on a bygone era of cinema and music; the birth,
as it were, of both. We are brought into early 20th century New Orleans, a
town with a hopping brothel, and evil magistrate, and streets teeming with
competing horn blowers. The tale follows our young protagonist, Louis (Anthony
Coleman), as he gets mixed up in the affairs of Grace (Shanti Lowry), a woman
of the night looking to protect her newborn from the horrors of the world she
has endured. Judge Perry (Jackie Earle Haley) rules the town by force, and
once he learns he is the father of Grace’s baby, he sicks his goon Pat
McMurphy (Michael Rooker) on her in hopes of shutting her up. That is, not if
Louis has anything to say about it.</p>

<p>Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, perhaps most well known for his work with a
young Steven Spielberg and an old Woody Allen, clearly approached the film
looking to exhume a vaudevillian style, a time when actors caked their faces
with makeup just so that their expressions might be seen in the cheap seats.
As cinema grew technologically, this tradition fell away, allowing
photographers to get in and capture an actor’s essence au natural. It seems
that Zsigmond is out to prove something on his own, using exaggerated, “caked
on”, cinematography. He celebrates the artifice of silent cinema: the sterile
sound stages, the comic fast motion, the tinted, washed out look. The trouble
is that artifice can only go so far, coming off as a one-joke parody rather
than an exploration of the way things were.</p>

<p>Part way through the film, when our heroine heads into her brothel, the camera
slides past a porch, through another entrance, up a stairwell and around the
den of iniquity, in a series of long takes. Never mind that this would have
been impossible to do in the silent cinema days, both for the weight of the
camera and the shortness of the reels; I couldn’t help but question whether or
not this shot has any place in this film regardless of time. It’s impressive,
like most long takes, only for its ambition. In execution, it adds little than
if we got snips and snaps of the building through montage. On top of that, we
witness a room full of half clothed harlots and their Johns, each couple more
racy than the next. The women exude a sense of 21st century pornographic
beauty, a far cry from period specific hookers. That, however, is the point.</p>

<p>One cannot think of <em>Louis</em> as a film with musical accompaniment, but a
concert with an adjoining film. Marsalis’s scores are predictable and
derivative, but that doesn’t mean they don’t serve an important narrative
purpose. This is clearly an emotional history of Jazz, focusing on it’s faster
progenitor, Dixieland. And that’s really the point. If we look at music in the
20th century, right up to our most recent aural movements, much of it stems
from the original “Devil’s Music”, Jazz. In that sense, Pritzker really earned
his R rating here, giving Jazz a bit of sex, a bit of naughtiness. Too quickly
we think of the musical genre as relegated to easy listeners and junior high
school students, too often we mistake it for a dead language. Pritzker and
Marsalis are here to say Jazz is not only alive but still capable of shocking
us, of pushing us to our darker, some would say more interesting, mind space.
In that sense, <em>Louis</em>, as far as I’ve heard it, is a rousing success. But to
watch it without music, is to watch very little.</p>

<p>Louis will be at the Apollo Theater in New York City on Monday, August 30th.
It is currently touring the U.S. through August 31st. For more details, <a href="http://www.louisthemovie.com/">visit
