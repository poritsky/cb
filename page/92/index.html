  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in the basement of a Manhattan bookshop when I was forced to purchase
Jack Cardiff’s memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Hour-Jack-Cardiff/dp/0571176402"><em>Magic Hour: The Life of a
Cameraman</em></a>. A
cinematographer friend of mine refused me a ride back to Philadelphia unless I
purchased it. “But don’t you own it? Can’t I borrow it?” I pleaded. “Trust me,
you’ll need a copy for yourself”. He was right.</p>

<p>Mr. Cardiff, who passed away earlier this week at the ripe age of 94, was a
cinematographer and filmmaker whose most well known claim to fame was being
the first British cameraman to shoot with Technicolor. His autobiography,
published under the prolific Faber &amp; Faber film moniker is an incredible read
for film geeks and cinema civilians alike. While so many other memoirs are
drizzled in name-droppery, fluffy anecdotes and grandiose “I-pioneered-that”
ego-centricisms without any semblance of an actual story, Mr. Cardiff’s tale
is one of adventure, invention, and discovery.</p>

<p>For us film folk living in a competitive and advanced 21st century, it is
often hard to remember the early wonder that was the cinema. In Mr. Cardiff’s
heyday, the motion picture was still a young art trying to find equal footing
with its established brethren: painting, photography, theater and the like. Of
course, without the introspection we have now looking back on olden times, Mr.
Cardiff approached these advancements in stride.</p>

<p>In 1936, Count von Keller and his wife hired Jack Cardiff to film their world
travels in glorious Technicolor. As a young man relatively new to the
business, he was given an opportunity like no other, to not only see the world
but to record it as had never been done before. Romantically, the artist
describes his world travels in great detail in his book. These are the parts
that will astound any reader, film buff or not.</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, the only film of his that I have seen in its entirety is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Narcissus-Collection-Deborah-
Kerr/dp/B00004XQN4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1240585728&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Black Narcissus</em></a>.
Watching it, you can see Mr. Cardiff’s worldly influence. Even today, there is
a certain amount of magic in the sheer expanse of the colorful film. Directors
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger put together a film that we well ahead
of its time in both form and content. How fitting it was to have a look that
would influence generations to come.</p>

<p>I have had very little exposure to Jack Cardiff, yet what little I know of him
has greatly influenced the way I approach film. You can look up a list of his
films on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002153/">IMDb</a> and, like I will be
doing, pop them on your queue. But for a real treat, you should check out
<em>Magic Hour</em>. Either way, bringing more Cardiff into one’s life is a very good
thing.</p>

=0.005988,0.009656&amp;z=17">AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13</a><em>Plenty of time is spent critiquing movies, but the
films themselves provide only part of the experience. Much of how you take in
a work is related to your surroundings, namely, the movie theater. Over the
next few weeks, I’ll be writing up some detailed info on New York’s best and
worst moviehouses in hopes of helping locals and tourists alike make informed
venue choices. Enjoy reading and feel free to add your own experiences in the
comments.</em></p>

<p>By all accounts, including programming, the AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13 is the
best movie theater in New York City. The gilded interiors invoke the movie
palaces of a bygone time, while the technical standards of each screen remains
unmatched. The upstairs lobby is home to black and gold palm trees as well as
goofy sketches of old time movie stars. There used to be shrines to particular
films (a glass encasement used to house props from <em>Legends of the Fall</em>, for
example), adding an almost religious aire to the place; something of a temple
to the gods of cinema.</p>

<p>A rarity in this 21st century, save for the three theaters in the basement,
this particular Loews has resisted the move to stadium seating. The result is
a more intimate experience. Even in the biggest theater, as the other audience
members feel a bit closer to you. I don’t mean in any claustrophobic manner,
rather the experience feels more shared. And if you’re worried that a tall
cowpoke in a ten gallon hat might sit in front of you, fear not, there isn’t a
bad seat in the house. The flattened seating is compensated for by the height
of the screen and the angle of the chairs.</p>

<p>AMC is known to be a bit more anal about projection than other chains, and
that is a very very good thing. Each screen at the Upper West Side theater, as
with most other AMCs in the nation, is set at then exact distance from the
projector for optimal picture. This is one of those things that is gotten
wrong time and time again in an effort to fit more seats into an auditorium.
When the projector is set back too far, the image loses color information and
can lose much of its sharpness. At movie theater screen sizes, a few inches is
all it takes to blow a great image. In terms of picture quality, I have never
been disappointed by the Lincoln Square Theater.</p>

<p>Thanks to audio branding like DTS, SDDS, and Dolby Digital, aural quality is
now less of an issue than it used to be. Still, many theaters are not
constructed well enough to deal with the added horsepower. In my experience, I
have never found myself in the awkward situation of sitting through a
tearjerker as an action hero gets blow’d up in the theater next to mine at the
Lincoln Square 13.</p>

<p>The popcorn is good (when it’s new), the sodas are huge, and the service is
slow, same crap you’ll find in all fifty states really. Obviously everything
is overpriced, but if you need some munchies, you are covered en masse.
Earlier I mentioned over the theaters in the basement. Avoid these if you can.
They are perfectly acceptable, but tiny, reminiscent of small screening rooms
at universities. The only fun part of going down there is the sweet film reel
ceiling over the escalator, seriously.</p>

<p>Regarding programming, the theater does not see many repertory films unless
they are part of a wider release, but they do cover an impressive cross-
section of mainstream and art house flicks. Again, for an arty film to make it
there it must open wide, but so many other theaters in the city scoff at such
fare. It’s nice to have such an advanced space showing smaller films. The
building also boast’s Manhattan’s only IMAX theater and has been home to a
number of world premieres.</p>

<p>To conclude, the AMC Loews Lincoln Square has everything a decent theater
should have, but it is the little things that make it the best. If you find
yourself in New York and need a good spot to check out the latest movie, this
should definitely be high on your list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Adventurland</em> is the story of James Brennan, a recent college graduate with a
noggin full of impeccable vocabulary and lofty esotericisms. When his father
takes a pay cut at work, his trip to Europe is called off and his fall plans
for grad school are put in jeopardy, leading him to a summer job at the local
theme park whose name is the film’s title. There, of course, he falls in love,
learns more about himself, and meets all kinds of wacky characters along the
way in this refined coming of age comedy.</p>

<p>Setting aside (most of) the raunch and raucousness of 2007’s <em>Superbad</em>,
writer/director Greg Mottola offers us a view of young adults that has become
frighteningly rare in Hollywood. Grounded yet hopeful, with limited but
sufficient resources, James and his love interest, Em, are relatable and
realistic twenty-somethings, not overly ironic Napoleon Dynamites or vacuous
shells like those found on NBC’s failed <em>Quarterlife</em> (does anyone even
remember that show?). It’s hard to describe their trials without giving away
much of the film’s draw, so let’s mostly take a look at the who instead of the
what.</p>

<p>Jesse Eisenberg, who plays James, has a real talent for comedic dialogue. He
delivers Mr. Mottola’s high-brow verbiage in a very plain spoken manner that,
instead of boring us, makes sense of the wordsmith’s dizzying work. Mr.
Eisenberg is basically picking up where Michael Cera ends. Both can do deadpan
and do it well, but in <em>Adventurland</em>, Eisenberg breaks through that stolid
mold to reveal James’s deeper conflict without ever letting up the Stan Laurel
act.</p>

<p>The real hidden gem in the film is Kristen Stewart as Em. Unlike James, who at
least had a life plan before his hopes were dashed, Em is still in college and
going through a tortured identiy crisis. All ot once, Ms. Stewart is a bubbly
townie, sophisticated undergrad, titlating seductress, and confused woman-
child. These traits come out in waves throughout the plot, but the young
actress manages to bring all of them to the forefront in every frame,
underscoring how complex the formative years of Em’s adult life are.</p>

<p>SNL centerpieces Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig appear sporadically not only for
extra padding in the laughter department but also as the only successful
relationship in the film. As much as James and Em dream to become more than
Bobby and Pauline (Hader and Wiig) who own the theme park, it is obvious that
their love and partnership is the only example they can look up to. For
philosophical exposition, we have Joel played by Martin Starr, whose wisdom is
equaled only by his geekiness. Mr. Starr is somewhat bringing the same weird-
kids-are-people-too charm he had on_ Freaks and Geeks_, and it is quite
welcome here.</p>

<p>Technically, the film makes a great deal out of very little, particularly in
the editing department. It is obvious that there were holes plugged up in the
editing phase of this film, but we never feel like editor Anne McCabe and her
team settled. Instead they pulled from a bag of tricks, namely re-recording
audio over wide shots (this is all conjecture, but a trained eye will notice
these things). Cinematographer Terry Stacey crafts some striking visuals,
particularly in scenes that occur near a bridge that remind me of a common
shot in many Woody Allen films, famously <em>Manhattan</em>.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, the film is sprinkled with wonderful nuance, such as
James’s father’s implied alcoholism or Em’s father’s philandering at
synagogue, of all places. This is not just a coming of age film in that this
isn’t only interesting to people who are coming of age. This is an amazingly
mature, layered piece that takes the form of a post-teen revelatory tale. <a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/2007/08/22/review-
superbad/">I
was personally pissed off</a> when everyone glossed over Mr. Mottola’s efforts on <em>Superbad</em>
(instead crediting the Judd Apatow cabal), so it is really nice to see him
come into his own on this film. It has been a long time coming, but this
should cement his place as a sought after talent, and we, as viewers, will be
the benefactors for years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you who missed it, last week the biggest digital leak in movie
history occurred on the web. A rough cut of 20th Century Fox’s <em>X-Men Origins:
Wolverine</em> found its way into the torrent stream and was downloaded countless
times, though experts put it in the low hundreds of thousands. The FBI has
opened an investigation to stem the flow of downloads and track down the
leak’s origin. There are overarching implications into what this means for
both filmmakers and critics alike. Let’s examine.</p>

<p>First off, I would like to mention that 20th Century Fox not only has the
right but the responsibility to seek out and prosecute whoever dropped the
ball on this one. It may seem like fun and games from our desk-chairs given
how easy and socially acceptable it has become to download media, but this is
no laughing matter. Leaks like this undermine the integrity of all filmmakers
and break down whatever mystique cinema still has over audiences. Furthermore,
this event is going to make the already paranoid studios more wary to work
with outside companies for fear of leaks, which potentially means less work
for such third parties.</p>

<p>That being said, the film did leak onto the internet, and the legal waters of
digital piracy remain just as murky as they were when Metallica took on
Napster almost a decade ago. Odds are no charges will ever be brought against
downloaders of the poisonous file. Fox really just wants to find who leaked it
and put him or her behind bars. So if the film is out there, what do we do
with it?</p>

<p>The short answer, from a film critics’ perspective, is nothing. As a
community, we have a responsibility to filmmakers and audiences alike. The
mututal respect between makers and critic relies on intentionality. A finished
product is open to discussion, but a work in progress is indefensible. The
sheer technical handicap of watching a film on your computer as opposed to in
its intended format on the big screen.</p>

<p>The longer answer is different. This leak, whether you have seen it or not (I
have not), is now part of the film. Those who didn’t download it can get
preliminary reviews from amateur critics, and the news media has made certain
that most of us know of the file’s existence. It is inescapable; the leak is
now intertwined with the film’s actual release. When <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>
was released shortly after Owen Wilson made an attempt at suicide, few critics
steered clear of drawing the parallel between that event and his character’s
similar attempts in the film. Point being: there are events surrounding every
film that add or detract from the film itself, and this is no exception.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t blame a diligent critic for at least considering a look at the
<em>Wolverine</em> workprint. After all, it offers raw insight into the filmmakers
process that few are privy to. If this were an unearthed copy of, say,
<em>Rosemary’s Baby</em>, who wouldn’t jump at the chance to pick it apart? In one
sense, whatever changes there may be between now and the film’s release may
serve to enrich the discussion of the film. Perhaps the public input will be
taken into account for some changes, creating an interactive editing
environment. Given the recent explosion of web interactivity, from Twitter to
Facebook to Ustream, audience members have the means and the desire to
participate in the movie making process. This is especially true in the case
of superhero adaptations, where the original fan base is incredibly vociferous
regarding accuracy and integrity.</p>

<p>But this isn’t <em>R__osemary’s Baby</em>. This is unfinished, unpolished, unreleased
material. <em>Wolverine</em> isn’t being given the fair chance to succeed or fail on
its own. Filmmakers need to be assured that their work is safe until released
to the public. The film ecosystem is based around every filmmaker’s
deliberateness to make the film he or she intends. When we can’t trust that,
then there is nothing to critique, nothing to grab hold of and consider
academically. Instead, there are just shots and scenes put together; not a
complete work.</p>

<p>It is unpopular to be on the side of a multinational corporation, least of all
one whose history is checkered with questionable ethics, but I must agree that
a leak of this stature is completely unacceptable. Fox has its business
concerns, but for me this is an artistic issue. This has less to do with
piracy in general and more to do with the sanctity of the post process. (I
would like to point out that I am not weighing in on the downloading or
distribution of already released material) It is surprising that it has taken
this long for this to happen, yet here we are. the best thing for us to keep
on doing what we do. There are enough finished films in the pipe to keep us
all busy, until the next one leaks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A solid if unoriginal indie flick with moving performances and a tight, quirky
script is what I had hoped to see at the movies. Instead, I saw <em>Sunshine
Cleaning</em>, which plays like an idea trying desperately hard to find a story.</p>

<p>The film follows Rose Lorkowski, played by Amy Adams, a down on her luck
single mother in Albuquerque who makes ends meat by cleaning houses. Rose’s
sister, Norah, is a former punk-kid who never grew up, can’t hold down a job,
and lives with their idiosyncratic father, played with respectable charm by
Alan Arkin. When Rose’s police officer boyfriend, who is married, tells her
how much money there is to be made in cleaning up messy crime scenes, a
lightbulb goes off and the tiny glint of a plot begins to form. Of course, the
two sisters start a business cleaning up crime scenes while dealing with their
own emotional hangups.</p>

<p>You’ve seen this movie before, which wouldn’t be so bad if <em>Cleaning</em> brought
anything original to the table. Everything, from the mopey starlet to the
plucky soundtrack; the misunderstood child to the busted up van; the
accidental lesbian to the bathroom motivational speeches, it’s all very
familiar in that eye-rolling kind of way (see below). Amy Adams does give a
good performance, but it’s not great. She is an incredibly talented actress
capable of much more than taking off her makeup and putting on a sad face. I
am convinced will have a bright future as a leading lady, probably more in the
direction of a Julia Roberts rather than a Rachel Weisz, but this blip is not
the kind that raises her “street cred” more than a half notch.</p>

<p>All of the problems lie in the script, however, which hands the entire cast
very little to work with. The brilliant Alan Arkin is left bumbling about with
nothing to grasp onto, try as he might. Instead of any characters being
developed or learning anything, they stare off into distances or yell into
train tracks, classic American indie fare. The only redeeming factor, for me,
was Steve Zahn, the policeman boyfriend, whose character leaves the film as
soon as he is given the opportunity to become interesting.</p>

<p>That really is the final word on this film. Everything ends as soon as it is
allowed to grow. I could go on and on about this movie, but the bottom line is
this: we deserve better. Take Amy Adams out of this movie and you would never
have had a wide release. There are so many good movies being made out there,
yet this is what rises to the top? Come on. I’ll let Tina Fey sum it all up
for me:</p>

embassy soirée in Dubai. Clive Owen barely approaches Julia Roberts at the
margherita table when we are thrust into this svelte little caper. Director
Tony Gilroy, still glowing from the success of <em>Michael Clayton</em>, returns with
his crack team (we’ll get to them) to create what this humble critic believes
is the best major release of 2009 so far.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen and Ms. Roberts play Ray Koval and Claire Stenwick, two former state
spies who take corporate intel positions at competing household products
firms, Equikrom and Burkett &amp; Randle (B &amp; R). When B &amp; R leaks the existence
of a top secret project, the game is on to see who can get to the spoils
first. That is really all I can put down here to keep the film interesting for
you, so let’s dive into the meat of it.</p>

<p>The last time Owen and Roberts appeared together was in Mike Nichols’ 2004
study in sexual warfare, <em>Closer</em>. Sex is no less a weapon in this film, but
this time around it is a hell of a lot more fun to watch. The relationship
between the two harkens back to the days of  Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn;
each one-upping the other’s tempestuousness with every scene. Mr. Owen slips
into the role of debonair goofball perfectly, while Ms. Roberts is so good at
reminding us of her fierce sexuality without ever letting us fully enjoy it.
She holds it back until we can’t take it anymore. It feels as though the two
were meant for each other as a comedy duo that dresses up like beautiful movie
stars. They truly hit every beat on target.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilroy is neither a voracious historian like Steven Spielberg nor a
sadistic cinema fetishist like Quentin Tarantino. Rather, he is a gifted
storyteller whose propensity to base his films on those of another era has
less to do with homage and more to do with a classical style of writing. He is
not lifting his characters from other works specifically. Instead, he is
relying on archetypes that have worked in cinema for six plus decades and
bringing his own original and wholly modern voice to the table.</p>

<p>The director also is not afraid to build on the great work of his
contemporaries. Specifically, James Newton Howard’s score (and musical
selection) feels as though he spent a weekend picking the brain of David
Holmes, the DJ and composer who provided the signature beat to all three of
Stephen Soderbergh’s _Ocean’s _films. In other ways, like the use of intercut
flashbacks and implementation of the split screen, the film seems to be
building on those three heist films as well. This is not plagirism, but
instead a doff of the cap as the filmmakers each move the genre forward in
different diresctions.</p>

<p>Visually speaking, the inimitable Robert Elswit brings his standard “A” game.
Just as he did for the city in <em>Michael Clayton</em>, Mr. Elswit brings New York
to life. Neither the glitzy, sterile dreamland of <em>Sex and the City</em>, nor the
gritty underbelly we see in Richard Donner’s forgettable <em>16 Blocks</em>, Elswit
brings to light a Manhattan that is at once mysterious and overwhelming,
beautiful and foreboding; the international epicenter of business, art,
fashion and industry that is sure to enchant whether you love it or hate it.
It is one of the most accurate portrayals of the city I have seen this decade.
It seems filmmakers have been struggling to represent New York ever since it
became cleaner and safer (read: less interesting) through the 1990s, so it’s
nice to see it look so good again.</p>

<p>Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkonson fill their roles as rival CEOs beautifully.
Giamatti is the stubby and insecure Richard Garsik, head of Equikrom, while
Wilkinson is the cocksure and mysterious Howard Tully at B &amp; R. The film’s
opening credits features the two in a fist fight in the rain. The sequence is
peak filmmaking; the two actors tustle and flop around with perfect comedic
awareness. Giamatti is given siginificantly more screen time during which he
shines, particularly in his final scene at a shareholders conference. I
couldn’t help but think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE">Steve Ballmer’s sweaty “Developers”
rant</a>, which is perfect because
this is the kind of man that Garsik is: paranoid, calculating and incapable of
accepting defeat.</p>

<p>The corporate buffoonery that fills <em>Duplicity’s</em> runtime comes not a moment
too soon. Many believe that  pure escapism is what will tie Hollywood over
through this recession instead of stories that deal with our trouble head-on.
This film offers us the best of both worlds. Mostly, it is pure unadulterated
fun. The people and locations are beautiful while the spy games are sexy and
non-violent. Still one can’t help but choke on some of those laughs as CEOs
and other haves get each other in the kind of trouble that only hurts the
have-nots in the end. In my opinion, there is an underlying message to this
film: in these uncertain times the reckoning will come to us all, unless of
course you are the smartest one in the room. Finding out who comes out on top
by the end of <em>Duplicity</em> is surely an experience worth having.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My great grandfather was an egg candler in Philadelphia. The job was
relatively simple. Hold an egg up to the light and determine its health. Some
eggs would be healthy enough to incubate and hatch while others would end up
in omelets and vaudeville acts. There was more to it, of course. Candlers like
my great grandfather had to have a finely tuned eye to make an informed
decision thousands of times a day.</p>

<p>We here at <strong>the candler blog</strong> try to apply the same methodology and care to
popular culture. We will do our best to hold anything that comes across our
radar up to a candle, so to speak. Looking at something on the surface is
rarely enough to determine its place in the world; instead we will try to
dissect it, see through it, understand it.</p>

<p>At least, this is the hope for <strong>the candler blog</strong>. For now, we will stick to
what we know: movies. Movie reviews, cinema essays, personal rants and the
like will be our bread and butter for the time being. We encourage your input
and want to make this an open space for all aspiring candlers out there.</p>

<p>We’ll let you know more about who we are and what our goals are in the weeks
to come, but for now, enjoy reading what we have. See you soon.</p>
