<p>Awful, but this is nothing new. As noted later in the story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Harry Potter owl craze echoes that of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle film in the early 1990s, when thousands of ­unwanted pet terrapins were dumped in Britain’s rivers, canals and lakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cahal Milmo at The Independent filed a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/look-out-abandoned-terrapins-about-1863903.html">story in 2010</a> about the long-term effects of the terrapin abandonment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conservationists have issued a warning that hundreds of boating lakes, canals and waterways in towns and cities are infested with terrapins and small turtles which were bought as pets while brightly-coloured babies barely bigger than a 50p coin but dumped by owners unable to cope as they grew to mature carnivorous adults the size of a dinner plate.</p>

  <p>The trend began in the early 1990s when thousands of red-eared terrapins, each capable of living up to 30 years, were bought by young fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cartoon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Children’s entertaiment and animals are a dangerous combination.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This <a href="http://www.quora.com/The-Talk-Show/Why-did-John-Grubers-The-Talk-Show-switch-podcast-networks/answers/1227036">anonymous Quora commenter</a> offers remarkable insight into what could have led to <em>The Talk Show</em> moving from 5by5 to Mule Radio Syndicate. It’s a bit long, with a 10 point breakdown of what could have led to <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">John Gruber’s silent departure</a>. Here’s one I hadn’t considered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gruber posts a list of the talk show sponsors on Daring Fireball each week. This is worth almost as much as the daring fireball sponsorship which he currently sells for $7500 a week. I bet this played a major part in the negotiations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds feasible.</p>

<p>Dan Harmon got fired from the fourth season of his show, <em>Community</em>. NBC has managed to screw its talent again, not realizing that writers are usually very good at articulating how, exactly, they got fired. This bit towards the end sounds like an admission that network television itself is outmoded. A final “fuck you” to the network.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t like the show, this is a great little piece of writing about what it’s like to be a creative person working in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/05/5by5-art.jpg" title="The Talk Show 5by5 Cover Art" /></p>

<p>I’ll be honest: I don’t know the answer to the question posited in this headline. But I can speculate.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know what <a href="http://5by5.tv/about">5by5</a> is, it’s a podcasting network founded by Dan Benjamin. He founded it in 2009, but I first heard of it when he started broadcasting <em>The Talk Show</em> with John Gruber of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> fame in July of 2010. This iteration of the show is technically a reboot; Benjamin and Gruber hosted a <a href="http://thetalkshow.net/">podcast of the same name</a> from 2007-2009.</p>

<p>5by5 really took off in early 2011 when Merlin Mann, of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">Hipster PDA</a> fame, started his own show on the network with Benjamin, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/"><em>Back to Work</em></a>. Around the same time John Siracusa started his show on the network, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/"><em>Hypercritical</em></a>, and the rest is basically history. 5by5 quickly became a premier podcasting network, especially for shows about technology and the self-employment lifestyle in general.</p>

<p>Though Gruber’s Talk Show was normally recorded weekly, it’s not so out of the ordinary for it, or really any 5by5 show, to skip a week unannounced or futz with the broadcast calendar. So when no new Talk Show episode had been posted since May 2nd, it wasn’t that much of an anomaly. Listeners just figured that the show was on hiatus; Gruber is often mysterious about his whereabouts on the air.</p>

<p>But Twitter lit up this afternoon when Gruber posted to his widely read site a link to a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/18/the-talk-show">brand new version of the show</a>, sans Dan Benjamin, on the <a href="http://muleradio.net/">Mule Radio Syndicate</a>, a different podcasting network started by designer and Gruber’s <a href="http://americanmccarver.com/">American McCarver</a> compatriot Mike Monteiro. No explanation for the move was offered in his blog post. And the new show, which he appears to be hosting alone with guests (this week it’s <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">John Moltz</a>), starts up right where the last show left off. No welcoming the audience to the new network, no reason is offered for the move. It’s just another episode of <em>The Talk Show</em> for Gruber, well, it’s his third first episode.</p>

<p>So what happened? Both <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gruber">Gruber</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danbenjamin">Benjamin</a> remain silent on Twitter. No live 5by5 broadcast was recording when this news hit the web, so no live comments from Dan. For now we have no facts as to what happened. But I have some ideas.</p>

<p>First off all, I think it’s pretty safe to assume this is the result of a falling out. 5by5 still lists <em>The Talk Show</em> as a current show, with Gruber’s name still appearing on a few pages on the site. If this was a long-brewing, considered and amicable separation, I’ll bet Dan would have had time to get the site in order and basically list <em>The Talk Show</em> as an archive.</p>

<p>Then there’s the fact that Dan released a new 5by5 iPhone app for broadcasting live and archived shows from the network. Listed in the App Store as a “Benjamin Productions” product, it sells for $2.99. I wondered, when I saw, why it wasn’t released under the 5by5 name. I’m sure there’s a good explanation for that, but suffice it to say, even though he’s on nearly every show on the network, Dan usually doesn’t take public ownership of most of the site’s output. Perhaps that didn’t sit well with everyone.</p>

<p>Now I’m wondering whether or not that app, which is the 32nd most popular paid entertainment app in the App Store as I write this, and the monies collected from the sale of it had anything to do with the split. The network has a solid business model: they sell ad time on all of their shows. The app now becomes a separate revenue stream. I don’t really have an opinion either way on whether or not the app should be paid or free, but it’s very interesting that, moments after linking to his revamped Talk Show, Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/18/mule-radio-app">posted a link on his site to Mule Radio’s iPhone app</a>, which is free. From Mule’s description of the app on their Web site, emphasis theirs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our friends at <a href="http://blackpixel.com/">Black Pixel</a> have built the finest, FREEST podcast app around. Your favorite Mule Radio shows, 100% free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The app launched yesterday.</p>

<p>My best guess is that there was either something related to the money the network was generating and/or the credit Gruber was or wasn’t getting for boosting the network to its current prominence. 5by5 probably wouldn’t be what it is without Gruber’s significant influence, but that cuts both ways.</p>

<p><em>The Talk Show</em> always had two hosts. Dan Benjamin helped keep the show on track when Gruber would wander off and riff. This new show lacks that structure and is instantly less enjoyable to listen to. I’ll certainly give the new Talk Show a chance, but Dan will be sorely missed. The show didn’t really hinge on either of them; they made a perfect team.</p>

<p>I hope we’ll get an actual explanation soon, but for now the show’s fan-base seems confused and put off. The initial reaction seems to be “Good riddance, John. Let’s see how you do in the wilderness.” Maybe Dan Benjamin actually built a network of fans even more loyal than those who visit Daring Fireball daily. Maybe the assertion that there would be no 5by5 without Gruber is incorrect.</p>

<p>Best of luck to them both.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED May 18, 2012, 5:53 PM EDT:</strong> Hacker News has a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3993649">great thread</a> going on why this split happened so suddenly. User dimensionmedia points out the following tweet from Mule Radio Syndicate:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="203565958235820032"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/bamboomba">bamboomba</a> No bad blood! John approached us and we were thrilled to welcome him. @<a href="https://twitter.com/5by5">5by5</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">gruber</a></p>&mdash; Mule Radio Syndicate (@MuleRadio) <a href="https://twitter.com/MuleRadio/status/203567508660297728" data-datetime="2012-05-18T19:27:30+00:00">May 18, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>So no bad blood, at least not between Mule and 5by5.</p>

<p>There’s also some speculation that the show’s t-shirts may have something to do with this. It sounds silly to actually write that sentence, but these shirts <em>were</em> a hot commodity in anticipation of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). To add a bit of conspiracy theory to this, Gruber <a href="http://twitter.com/gruber/status/203513813029498880">announced a run of Daring Fireball</a> t-shirts today.</p>

<p>A number of people have pointed out the awkward sign-off from that May 2nd episode. William Savona <a href="http://twitter.com/williamsavona/status/203591539094601730">posted</a> the clip on Twitter:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F46843103&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe>

<p>Hacker News user <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bjplink">bjplink</a> transcribed it:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Benjamin:</strong> We&#8217;ll be back regular time next week, right?<br /><strong>Gruber:</strong> I guess so.<br /><strong>Benjamin:</strong> Ok. Thanks John.<br /><strong>Gruber:</strong> Adios.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>UPDATED May 18, 2012, 10:41 PM EDT:</strong> Hacker News user <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lukeman">lukeman</a> dug into the Mule Radio app <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3993731">and found this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So Mule now has The Talk Show and its new iOS app is really a reskinned 5by5 app that never was released (check inside the app bundle and you’ll see the class prefix is FBF and the 5by5 logo is even in there—presumably unused).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2D1m0I3q080P0I093x26/1-wc.png" title="Mule App Innards" /></p>

<p>Daniel Pasco, the CEO of Black Pixel who makes the app, took to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3994053">Hacker News to clear up confusion</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The application and the source code in question belongs to Black Pixel. We designed and developed the application in-house, at our own expense, and were going to license the binary for free, non-exclusive use on the 5by5 network, but that deal didn&#8217;t work out.</p><p>Quite some time later, we got to know the folks at Mule Radio, and felt like there might be a good opportunity for our work to see the light of day. So we discussed things with them and licensed the binaries to them for use on their show.</p></blockquote>

<p>An honest mistake, but one worth noting.</p>

<p>Gruber also <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/netnewswire_black_pixel">interviewed Pasco back in June 2011</a> when Black Pixel acquired NetNewsWire.</p>

<p><strong>Updated May 19, 2012, 8:01 AM EDT:</strong> While there are still no definitive details on what happened with the split, John Gruber, his Wife Amy Jane Gruber and Mike Monteiro took to Twitter last night and basically spelled out that there was nothing amicable about this. A reader also pointed out to me that, before any of this news, Dan Benjamin tweeted to following to a listener asking why there hadn’t been a show in awhile:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="203451788328845312"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/alexbrooks">alexbrooks</a> It makes me sad.</p>&mdash; Dan Benjamin (@danbenjamin) <a href="https://twitter.com/danbenjamin/status/203466169439625220" data-datetime="2012-05-18T12:44:49+00:00">May 18, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>A few hours later, Amy Jane Gruber, who tweets a few times a month, started talking about the split:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>I feel like I’ve become the Artie in this situation so I’m going to pull a Rip Torn and get drunk and break into a bank.</p>&mdash; Amy Jane Gruber (@AmyJane) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyJane/status/203577012550504449" data-datetime="2012-05-18T20:05:16+00:00">May 18, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>“If I only went into business with people you liked, I would have gay married @<a href="https://twitter.com/lonelysandwich">lonelysandwich</a> 5 years ago.&#8221;</p>&mdash; Amy Jane Gruber (@AmyJane) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyJane/status/203673354073415681" data-datetime="2012-05-19T02:28:06+00:00">May 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>Lonelysandwich is <a href="http://lonelysandwich.com/">Adam Lisagor</a>, known for his unique Internet advertisements. He is also an Executive Producer of <em>Put This On</em> and a co-host of <em>You Look Nice Today</em>, a weekly conversation podcast he records with Merlin Mann and Scott Simpson. I suppose we could assume she is quoting John, but then that would imply <em>she</em> had a problem with Dan Benjamin. <em>Updated May 20, 2012, 5:32 PM EDT: Commenter <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/#comment-533251540">HarveyMunchkin</a> points out that this interpretation of this tweet is probably backwards. See below.</em></p>

<p>Late last night, John responded in his own oblique way with a single tweet related to the split.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>I get email. <a href="http://t.co/4DbZ34aY" title="http://twitter.com/gruber/status/203672893354295297/photo/1">twitter.com/gruber/status/…</a></p>&mdash; John Gruber (@gruber) <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/203672893354295297" data-datetime="2012-05-19T02:26:17+00:00">May 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>The loudest voice on Twitter was Mike Monteiro, who started Mule Radio Syndicate:</p>

<p>There is still no full story as to why the split happened and, other than his single tweet, Dan is yet to acknowledge it. These tweets pretty much confirm this wasn’t a clean, amicable break, which makes you wonder who’s running <a href="http://twitter.com/MuleRadio/status/203567508660297728">Mule Radio’s Twitter account</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Updated May 20, 2012, 5:32 PM EDT:</strong></p>

<p>This is the last update I plan to make to this post, but if anything new comes up you can be sure I’ll write a new post about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/19/wwic">Gruber linked</a> to Paul Ford’s post from January, 2011, “<a href="http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html">The Web Is a Customer Service Medium</a>” last night, the crux of which is, “‘Why wasn’t I consulted,’ which I abbreviate as WWIC, is the fundamental question of the web.” His chosen excerpt includes “the way that digital groupies claim ownership of their heroes online,” perhaps chiding those who feel blighted by his (or, in fairness, Dan Benjamin’s) actions.</p>

<p>But he also leaves this part out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The web is not, despite the desires of so many, a publishing medium. The web is a customer service medium. “Intense moderation” in a customer service medium is what “editing” was for publishing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, is this story the fault of the “digital groupies” for taking ownership of their heroes, or the fault of the publisher for not mitigating this customer service blip properly?</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/20/they-write-about-podcasts/">my own piece on why this is a story</a>, which I just posted.</p>

<p>Also, I enjoyed <a href="http://youcallthat.posterous.com/a-breakup">this post by Joshua Altmanshofer</a>. It’s a nice, personal reaction to this whole story.</p>

<p>His post is long but worth reading. He first offers a cogent explanation for why <em>The Avengers</em> works even though it doesn’t make any sense. Then Card lyrically recounts his experience on the set of the film of his book. His outlook on the project is inspiring.</p>

<p>Aaaron Sorkin gave a few great little tidbits about his forthcoming Steve Jobs film while doing press for his new HBO show, <em>The Newsroom</em>. He&rsquo;s working on finding the best angle for the film, which hopefully means it&rsquo;s not going to be too biopic/<em>Forrest Gump</em>-y.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drama is tension versus obstacle. Someone wants something, something is standing in their way of getting it.

<p>Sounds good to me. This only reaffirms what I wrote yesterday, that Sorkin is <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/17/the-right-guy/">the right guy</a>.</p>

<p>The title of <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42">episode 42 of Hypercritical</a>, a weekly technology podcast with John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin, refers directly to Walter Isaacson, the author of the widely acclaimed and seminal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecandlerblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1451648537">biography of Steve Jobs</a>. Plainly, it is called “The Wrong Guy.” <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/15/siracusa-jobs-bio">John Gruber summarized</a> the 75 minute takedown best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…his multi-faceted critique of the book is simply devastating. I went into this podcast knowing that I thought the book was flawed, knowing that Siracusa did too, and expecting to be nodding my head in agreement with him throughout the show. But it’s worse than that. Isaacson blew it, a one-time opportunity forever squandered. Jobs picked the wrong guy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Siracusa’s overarching complaint is that Isaacson had little understanding of the technology industry as a whole, thus he not only botched little details of the story of Jobs’s life, but missed the main point of what made Jobs so different from his contemporaries. He notes that much of the history in the Isaacson’s book has appeared elsewhere in greater detail with more stirring narratives. Unforgivably, in Siracusa’s view, he wasted the unprecedented access to Jobs by asking the wrong questions because he didn’t grasp the enormity of Jobs’s accomplishments.</p>

<p>Earlier this week it was announced that Aaron Sorkin will be writing the film adaptation of Isaacson’s book, which is poised to become the definitive Steve Jobs biopic.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Based on his past work, I believe Sorkin is the right guy.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“Leaked” set photos, teasers for teaser trailers and poster premiere dates have all become standard bits of movie marketing in the last few years. This one today from Paul Thomas Anderson, who is currently finishing up his 1950s cult-themed film <em>The Master</em>, is probably my favorite of them all. The director <a href="http://cigsandredvines.blogspot.com/2012/05/exclusive-65mm-filmstrip-reveals-first.html">emailed photos of the film’s 65mm negative being cut by hand</a> to Anderson fan-site Cigarettes and Red Vines. From his verse-styled accompanying text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These shots include our lovely<br />
Negative Cutter, Simone, imported<br />
all the way from France to cut 65mm<br />
negative.   She does it all with a pair<br />
of scissors from Staples.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The posts author then cropped and inverted the one picture of the film’s actual negative and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cdubs39/7201696096/in/photostream/">shared it on Flickr</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/05/the-master.jpg" title="The Master Still" /></p>

<p>I never thought I’d hear about a negative cut again for a major U.S. release. It should come as no surprise that I’m more excited for <em>The Master</em> than any other 65mm release I can recall.</p>

<p>Brilliant scoop from Cigarettes and Red Vines<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and a great way for Anderson to pump up his cinematically nerdy fans.</p>
