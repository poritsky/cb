  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just put a red Netflix envelope in the mail for the first time in quite
awhile. I couldn’t remember when I had even gotten the film in the mail, so I
looked it up. March 3rd. 207 days ago. For 29 and a half weeks, the disc had
been sitting in my house, unwatched.</p>

<p>That’s 7 billing cycles.</p>

<p>Up until this month, my 1 Blu-ray a month plan cost $11.99. That means that
single disc cost me $83.93. Sort of.</p>

<p>See, I use Netflix’s Watch Instantly service quite a bit, especially for
catching up on television series. I watch it on my iPad, sometimes (but
rarely) on my iPhone and constantly on my television through a Boxee Box.</p>

<p>Quantifying the value of Watch Instantly can be a bit tricky. Netflix does
retain detailed records of everything you watch, when you watched it and for
how long you watched it, but some of the numbers are a bit weird. When I
watched <em>The Big Lebowski</em> on March 6th, for example, Netflix logged that as 3
hours and 23 minutes. That’s about an hour and a half longer than the film’s
actual runtime.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Suffice it to say, the website’s watch log is inexact, but
it’s all we’ve got.</p>

<p>In the time I’ve had this one disc at home, I’ve watched about 60 hours of
Watch Instantly. In 7 billing cycles, that’s about 8.5<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> hours a month.
Under Netflix’s new pricing, streaming only is $7.99 per month. I’ll stick
with that figure for my streaming math and the remaining $4.00 for my 1 Blu-
ray. Thus, while that 1 disc gathered dust at home, I spent some $55.93 on
streaming and $28.00 to rent this one movie. I spent less than a dollar
($0.94) an hour on Watch Instantly content, on average.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Netflix as a streaming only service is a pretty great deal if you find
something you want to watch. For discs it’s a different story. Under Netflix’s
new rates, which will carry over to Qwikster, a single Blu-ray at a time costs
$9.99 per month without streaming included. In that case, that single
unwatched disc would have cost me $69.93, 25% <em>more</em> than watching 60 hours of
streaming content over 7 months.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s entirely my fault for not returning the disc and having
another one sent. If I had kept a disc from a video store this long, I’d have
probably paid a substantial late fee<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> so I have no real complaints about
how Netflix’s disc service works. The question now, of course, is whether or
not discs are worth paying for if my return habits are so lax.</p>

<p>Prior to this marathon rental, I had a disc for 112 days. Before that I was on
the 3 Blu-ray plan and had 3 films for 69 days. I didn’t watch any of them.
There are a number of contributing factors to the erosion of my disc
diligence, and perhaps I’ll go over some in another post. It’s worth noting
that I’m not necessarily a typical viewer. I see a great deal of films in the
theater and I also go to press screenings, film festivals and get screeners
sent to me. This breakdown is purely anecdotal, but I gather I’m not alone.</p>

<p>At $4.00 a month for Blu-rays, Netflix was the best deal around. Now? I’ve got
to decide if it’s worth keeping around.</p>

<p>logged as watch time?</p>

<p><em>Lebowski</em>. I’m basically throwing 42 minutes out the window.</p>

<p>vogue, would I consider calculating media value by hour like this. What’s a
unit of streaming measurement? An hour? A program? A sitting? I’m only using
hours here to make the math a bit easier, but note that I wouldn’t measure a
disc the same way. If I had rented, say, <em>Schindler’s List</em>, which spans two
discs, I would count that as a single film.</p>

<p>grossly overdue videos. I had to pay it at least twice.</p>

<p>For a x.0.1 update, this actually adds a lot of good stuff. The “Media Stems Export” and role assignment actually solves a pretty big problem from previous versions of FCP. The old way of doing this is way more confusing, which is why most people just screw it up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The day has come. Netflix, the company whose iconic red mailer sleeves upended the home video business over the last decade, is getting out of the disc delivery business. In an honest and transparent message to customers today, CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings expressed regret over his handling of the company’s recent restructuring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and announced that the disc-by-mail service will soon be spun off into a separate product known as Qwikster. Netflix proper will be a streaming only company.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to look at the timeline of how this transpired:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>July 12:</em> <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html">Netflix announces pricing changes</a> and restructuring in a blog post. The post was written VP of Marketing Jessie Becker, Netflix’s VP of Marketing.</li>
  <li><em>September 1:</em> New prices go into effect.</li>
  <li><em>September 15:</em> <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/price-hike-sends-netflixs-stock-downward/">Netflix’s stock drops 15%</a> with news that the company will lose roughly 1 million subscribers over the price hike, more than anticipated.</li>
  <li><em>September 19:</em> <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html">CEO Reed Hastings apologizes</a> for his silence during the pricing transition and announces Qwikster.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make no mistake, this was the plan back on July 12 when the changes were announced:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reflecting our confidence that DVDs by mail is a long-term business for us, we are also establishing a separate and distinct management team solely focused on DVDs by mail, led by Andy Rendich, our Chief Service and Operations Officer and an 11 year veteran of Netflix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s clear from the timing of these events that this plan had already been prepared. Instead of stepping backwards and changing the pricing structure again, Hastings pushed the company forward, drastically. Netflix doesn’t want consumers to associate its name with plastic discs anymore. The original announcement said as much, but consumers didn’t understand the message. Now they do.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about the internals of the company, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Hastings wanted to spin their disc-by-mail service off all long. Perhaps that’s why he was relatively hands off as the September 1 transition loomed; “Plan A” was a compromise, but the Qwikster plan was always what was going to work.</p>

<p>As to what this means for home video, I think that both Netflix and Qwikster have an uphill struggle from here on out, the latter especially. For one, anyone who was on the fence about keeping a disc-plus-streaming plan now has added obstacles to overcome. Billing, film ratings and queue management will have to be handled completely separately for both services. I let my one Blu- ray plan lapse into the new pricing and I suspect many Netflix subscribers did as well. Having to set up and manage an entirely new service gives me pause. Why not set up camp elsewhere?</p>

<p>As for Netflix’s streaming only? It is bogged down by a number of issues today. The barrier to entry is still high. In order to get streaming video on your television, you need <em>both</em> a broadband connection and a set top box (Roku, AppleTV, Blu-ray player, game console , etc.) or Netflix compatible television. Even assuming one has the equipment to play streaming video, customers still have to pay their Internet Service Provider on a monthly basis. On the disc side of things, the player is simply a one-time purchase.</p>

<p>Netflix’s biggest hurdle for streaming has always been the content deals it can broke in Hollywood. In today’s blog post, Hastings alluded to “substantial” new content deals that will be announced in the coming months. The elephant in the room is <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/09/netflix-to-lose-starz-its-most-valuable-source-of-new-movies.html">Starz, who announced that it will pull its content from Netflix in February</a> when their current contract lapses. Starz represents about 8% of Netflix’s current streaming slate.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> As studios get their own feet wet in the streaming game<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> they have grown lukewarm to the idea of licensing to Netflix. Today, Netflix’s Watch Instantly selection is not comprehensive enough to make it the only choice for a lover of media. We’ll have to wait and see what content deals Hastings is teasing.</p>

<p>For now, I’m going to stick with Netflix and I’ll see about Qwikster once it goes live. Consumers certainly have a right to be frustrated. It’s very rare you’ll see a company make a move this risky after news that they are losing customers in droves. This is certainly the biggest shift in the company’s history. We’ll see how it turns out.</p>

  <p>It feels like director Jesse Peretz and writers David Schisgall and Evgenia Peretz set out to make a film from a different era, perhaps after watching <em>Hannah and Her Sisters</em> a few too many times. Coogan’s artistic putz, for one, is something of a clone of Max von Sydow’s Frederick, as are the finite lines along which these sisters cleave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some laughs, for sure, but otherwise an avoidable affair.</p>

<p>From Steve Jobs’s 1997 Macworld Boston keynote; the very beginning of his return to Apple. Jobs believes these words with every fiber of his being and has worked tirelessly to back them up.</p>

<p>I got my first Mac in 2002, and no other tool has enhanced my ability to express myself better. Steve: thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Years ago, I came to terms with the fact I that was a North-Atlantic snob. By that I mean I had no desire to live anywhere in the U.S. other than along(-ish) the coast from D.C. to Maine. I grew up outside of Philadelphia and came to recognize the cardinal advantages of this stretch of country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It gets cold, but not too cold.</li>
  <li>It gets hot, but not too hot.</li>
  <li>There are blizzards, but never so bad.</li>
  <li>There are nor’easters, but not hurricanes.</li>
  <li>No tornados.</li>
  <li>No dust storms.</li>
  <li>No too-serious droughts.</li>
  <li><strong>No Earthquakes.</strong>  </li>
</ul>

<p>With yesterday’s tremor my snobbery gets thrown out of the window completely. Really, the only thing on that list that truly keeps me here is the concept that the earth under my feet generally stays put.</p>

<p>West coasters like to talk lightly of earthquakes, as if they are nothing. Bullshit, I said. It’s the earth. And it quakes. Dismissing that fact is ludicrous.</p>

<p>When college ended, as a film student I was left with two ostensible options for setting up tent: New York or Los Angeles. I was offered a very low-paying non-film-related job in L.A., and I almost took it. Many factors made me choose New York City (proximity to family, affordability of transportation, easy rooming arrangements with friends) and I have made many more excuses for shackling myself to the North-Atlantic coastline over the years. Really, the lack of natural disasters that occur in this city is one of my main defenses for staying here.</p>

<p>But that’s all changed now. The tremor <em>was</em> nothing. I hardly knew it was happening even though I felt it. And I’m fine. And now I believe my cynical west coast friends who have dismissed earthquakes as just a simple act of nature, like the changing of the leaves or the blowing of the wind.</p>

<p>If I need to leave New York now, I can.</p>
