  <div class="entry-content"><p>I picked up <a href="http://amzn.to/QANrG1"><em>2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a short while back on the recommendation of my pal, <a href="http://twitter.com/thejewishdream">Rafi</a>. I’ve always loved Albert Brooks and was curious what a novel by the comedian and auteur would be like. Plus it had the added bonus of being cheekily billed as a near-future tale of what would happen if America elected a Jewish President. Hilarious!</p>

<p>While it <em>is</em> a work of comedy, Brooks also makes a lot of astute observations about our nation and the geo-political climate we live in. In the run-up to the Presidential election, I highly recommend you give it a look.</p>

<p>When I wrote yesterday about <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/10/04/pbs/">Mitt Romney’s PBS comment</a>, I refrained from commenting on his context: “I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.” <em>2030</em> deals largely with an America that becomes dependent on Chinese funds. While initially I thought of the book as a sort of conservative cautionary tale, Rafi turned me on to the idea that Brooks is offering instead a positive outlook on a globalist future. China’s ascent, in other words, doesn’t have to be America’s undoing.</p>

<p>There is a patina of old-world racism to Romney’s riffs against taking Chinese money. He could have set forth a plan to avoid taking foreign money altogether, but refusing British or German funds doesn’t light a fire under Americans’ asses. When he talks about China he’s invoking images of some kind of unsavory back room handling, loan sharking being peddled alongside opium pipes and gremlins. Now, there may well be reasons not to grow our debt, but racial myopia isn’t one of them.</p>

<p><em>2030</em> paints a starkly realistic, if exaggerated, picture of America’s trajectory, laying bare the classist, ageist and racist rhetoric that has come to define our politics. It does so with plenty of laughs and without taking a partisan stance. One of the main lessons I learned is that cooperation between China and the US should be far from our worst fear. I don’t want to wait 18 years as a nation to come to that simple realization.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>3M and Roku <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3001936/roku-and-3m-tell-streaming-tv-users-where-they-can-stick-it">just announced a partnership</a>, shipping a mini-projector with an integrated Roku Streaming Stick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The projector is small enough to be carried around, bright enough to project a picture 120-inch picture, and powerful enough to pack over two and a half hours of battery life–“long enough to watch just about any movie,” according to Mark Colin, 3M general manager of mobile interactive solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This thing sounds even dumber than the streaming stick itself, which will only work with televisions whose HDMI ports are Mobile High Definition Link (MHL) compatible. This allows the HDMI port to feed power to the $99 (!) stick.</p>

<p>I don’t get the thinking here. It’s more than likely that you won’t be able to plug the streaming stick into anything other than 3M’s projector, so there’s no real value-add. The Fast Company article by Jillian Goodman linked above also drops this bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As far as Roku goes, they’re aiming at nothing short of being the OS of TV. “I guess I would say Roku is sort of where I thought the world had been heading for a while,” says [CEO Anthony] Wood. “It’s just taken a while to get here.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not partner with actual television makers? Better, why not start by building Roku as an OS on the 3M projector?</p>

<p>Anyway, I still love my Roku LT. They offer the most comprehensive web-TV offering out there and I want to see them succeed. This stick just sounds like a year or more of wasted effort.</p>

<p>If you want to order a <a href="http://amzn.to/SCceMe">3M Streaming Projector Powered by Roku, please use this link</a> so I’ll get a few bucks. You’ll be supporting this site and independent writing.</p>

I actually like you too. But I&#8217;m not going to&#8212;I&#8217;m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.</p><footer><strong>-Mitt Romney</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate">October 3, 2012</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Mitt Romney&rsquo;s PBS rejoinder<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has quickly become the most talked about soundbite from last night&rsquo;s Presidential debate. It seems as though everyone has a Big Bird joke or critique to share today, quipping that the avian celebrity has been fired or some other nonsense.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s be serious about this. The PBS volley is a stunning bit of political theater; a calculated and workshopped line designed to do exactly what it has done: spread like wildfire. While the wonks break down his many dubious claims, Mitt Romney has thrown the rest of us some gristle. He fit a pop culture reference into a direct threat against the event&rsquo;s moderator, Jim Lehrer. LOL!</p>

<p>Beneath the fun,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> however, there is something very cynical and dangerous brewing. There is nothing funny about cutting subsidies to Public Broadcasting Systems. The comment that spawned a few <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/stacylambe/big-bird-responds-to-mitt-romney-on-twitter">comedic Twitter accounts</a> should be seen as a signifier of the stark differences between these two candidates.</p>

<p>I believe in the arts and the media. I believe, with every fiber of my being, that no nation can become or stay great without investing in its most creative citizens. After all, without culture, what are we? <em>Who</em> are we?</p>

<p>So I find it baffling that politicians are constantly willing to put arts and media funding on the chopping block, but I find it more disturbing that we tend to get strong-armed into believing that they&rsquo;re right. America is hurting, Mitt Romney tells us, therefore we shouldn&rsquo;t be pouring millions of dollars into a puppet show. And people believe him because, with everything going on in all of our lives right now, they can&rsquo;t bring themselves to tell him he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>

<p>I find it highly unlikely that a Mitt Romney administration will actually be able to de-fund PBS or other endeavors that generally live in fear like the National Endowment for the Arts.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> It&rsquo;s more likely that this rehearsed &ldquo;zinger&rdquo; is a feint intended to keep us abuzz with talk of how slick and collected the Republican contender looked and hope we don&rsquo;t notice some of his more gross misstatements from the evening. Still, it&rsquo;s indicative of the kind of cynicism we can look forward to if Romney is elected.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that the economy is weak. Many of us are out of work or underpaid. Benefits that we once enjoyed have shriveled up. States are barely getting by. There&rsquo;s growing unrest in the Middle East and we still can&rsquo;t get out of Afghanistan, troubles we all have to foot the bill for. But I&rsquo;ll be damned if I let that get it the way of my support for publicly financed television. We have already given up so much; must we give up on Big Bird too?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dave Itzkoff has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/movies/documentary-directors-see-flaws-in-new-rules-for-oscar.html">piece up at <em>The New York Times</em> today</a> detailing new rules for the Best Documentary Oscar. Apparently members have too many (eighty, to be specific) damn films to watch. Steve James, director of <em>Hoop Dreams</em> and <em>The Interrupters</em> weighs in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Should it be about the way in which the public engages a documentary — films that they have seen at the theater, that have been hits on the festival circuit, that are going to have the best chance?” he asked. Or, he said, should it “throw open the doors to every single film that can wrangle a date in L.A. and New York?”</p>

  <p>“You can’t have it both ways,” Mr. James said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth is that documentary cinema has simply outgrown a single award. Moreover, the rules that govern what makes a great doc are very different from what makes a great narrative fiction film. For example, the new rule, per Itzkoff, is in part intended to “to weed out films that were made for television…” Why not cast an even wider net with more awards, or a second awards show? Or perhaps allow other voters to consider documentaries in other categories, like editing or, dare I say it, Best Picture.</p>

  <p>In the span of mere minutes, he went from eating a bag of M&amp;Ms at 11,000 feet to sitting in a wrecked plane in the Gulf. […]</p>

  <p>Wright used the iPad, still in its LifeProof case, to record a brief video, a record of where they were and what was happening.</p>

<p>I caught these guys on <em>The Today Show</em> this morning. It’s sad that I can’t help but wonder if this isn’t all a viral marketing ploy from the makers of the LifeProof case whose brand name is getting dropped at every turn. Nonetheless, it seems the best best camera is still the one you have on you, even if you’re stranded out at sea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For no good reason I decided to try blogging entirely from the command line. That meant firing up Vim on my server, which meant digging out <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">this old link</a> to keep me from losing my mind. And so I am sharing it with you, for the day when you too decide that the pile of text editors you have to choose from aren’t fiddly enough.</p>
