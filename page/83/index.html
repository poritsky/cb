<p>Last night, the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS, the primary higher educational institution of the Conservative Movement) hosted a screening and panel on <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>. (To catch up on how the candler blog feels about the film, you can check Sunrise Tippeconnie&rsquo;s essay, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/08/21/once-upon-a-time-in-violence-occupied-cinema-an-analysis-of-inglourious-basterds/">Once Upon a Time in Violence Occupied Cinema</a>, which was written for the film&rsquo;s theatrical release.) Though an appearance by Quentin Tarantino was promised, the auteur was a no show claiming a sore throat (he gets the benefit of the doubt from me). Luckily, the producer of the film, Lawrence Bender, one of QT&rsquo;s hebraic guides on the project, was in attendance to discuss the topic of &ldquo;Jewish Persecution and the Fantasy of Revenge&rdquo; alongside Dr. Amy Kalmanofsky, a bible and horror film scholar, and Rabbi Jack Moline, a pulpit Rabbi in Virginia whose Kol Nidre sermon about <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> sparked the institution&rsquo;s interest in hosting such an event. Also, leading the panel was the school&rsquo;s Chancellor, Arnold M. Eisen. Phew, now you have all the details, so how was it?</p>

<p>This was my third public screening of the film, though the first one on video. I have to say, if you missed this movie on film, you pretty much missed it. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. This was an academic event so I gave some leeway on projected quality, though I will say I&rsquo;ve seen much worse in other college auditoriums. Unsurprisingly, watching the film in a room full of mostly Jews, mind you months after the film had been unleashed on the masses, was barely different from watching the film in a room full of gentiles. Duh. A great fry cook once said &ldquo;peoples is peoples&rdquo;, of course, these are the chosen people watching their greatest enemies slaughtered on screen with great flair. There must be something different.</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see, the audience wasn&rsquo;t quite as &ldquo;in&rdquo; on the jokes that a room full of film critics would be in on. There are points in the film at which I was the only one laughing hysterically, usually violent scenes, but again that happened at my other screenings. While there were no great cheers as Hitler&rsquo;s corpse gets the Swiss cheese treatment, which Mr. Bender says there were at the Israeli premiere, the audience did seem to get a kick out of some of the Nazi-killing gore. &ldquo;Say aufedersein to your Nazi balls&rdquo;, for example, got everyone quite excited. Just as I felt at the film&rsquo;s release, this is an altogether human story, not one of Jewish redemption. But don&rsquo;t tell the curators of this event, because they brought up some really interesting points about the film in the context of modern (and ancient) Jewish thought.</p>

<p>Dr. Kalmanofsky, no stranger to Judeo-Chrisitian-pop deconstruction, opened the discussion with some fascinating points about the concept of the revenge fantasy, positing that the Jewish bible, specifically the story of the exodus from Egypt, indulges the concept of violent revenge. Besides the ten plagues brought down against their aggressors, arguably deserved, the Israelites break out in song and dance after they cross the parted Sea of Reeds, which closes and drowns the entire Egyptian faction that was chasing them. This punishment goes well beyond the tit-for-tat measures of the plagues, and remorse is not really discussed until the Rabbinic era of Judaism several hundred years after the fact. In other words, while the modern Jew may be morally inquisitive and emotionally conflicted, in the bible, living out the revenge fantasy was something very real.</p>

<p>Rabbi Moline proffered that the Jewish people have become mired in thought for so long that the idea of physical redemption has been lost. The saying &ldquo;two Jews, three opinions&rdquo; comes to mind on this point. As the concept of Talmudic discourse has proliferated, especially in the wake of the Holocaust (Why did this happen to us? Is it our fault?), Jews may have lost the instinct of revenge, which Moline points out is in fact a basic human instinct. The film provides that for a generation of Jews who view the holocaust in a new light. <em>Inglorious Basterds</em> represents a voice for that generation.</p>

<p>Producer Lawrence Bender&rsquo;s input, obviously the most cinematic in this crowd, was quite interesting. After telling a story about Tarantino calling actors by their characters&rsquo; names on set which resulted in more than a few awkward moments with Martin Wuttke, the actor who portrays Hitler in the film, he joined in on Rabbi Moline&rsquo;s generational perspective of the film. Looking to a specific arc from the last twenty years, he mentioned that we go from <em>Schindler&rsquo;s List</em> to <em>Life Is Beautiful</em> to <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>. Another way to put it is from drama to comedy to fantasy. This is a concept I could write volumes about, but I&rsquo;ll spare you for now. Another interesting point Mr. Bender brought up is that in both the Israeli and German premieres of the film, the audiences felt a sense of personal redemption. In both cases, the press mentioned that only a non-German/non-Jew could pull off such a film. I&rsquo;m not sure that there is any validity to this point, however the fact remains that a non-German/non-Jew <em>did</em> make this film.</p>

<p>All in all it was a fascinating evening. Kudos to JTS for putting together such a relevant program. I don&rsquo;t really believe that there is all that much specifically Jewish about the film, but Rabbi Moline kept harping on the fact that the film has awoken something in the Jewish community. Not a call to arms, but a call to deconstructing the meaning of the inner vengeance of a people. Polemics have always been an important pillar of Rabbinic discourse, but visceral nature is something often pushed to the side in favor of academics. Perhaps, says the Rabbi, it is a time to finally confront that urge we have to murder Hitler, to root out our enemies. Not to indulge it, but to question it.</p>

<p>Hell, if one little film can bring out all that from the leaders of one of the world&rsquo;s major religions, it must be doing something right. What say you, readers? Fill up the comments with your thoughts on the matter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/A-TOWN-CALLED-PANIC_2-1024x667.jpg" alt="A Town Called Panic Still" />In my bloggy world
I like keep up a certain level of decorum. Throwing in three-plus syllable
words I find in my thesaurus, needlessly sticking to the New York Times style
guide, and always listing at least three things if ever I need to describe an
idea are all tactics I use to keep readers taking me seriously. However, every
once in awhile it is necessary to shed such formalities and let bare a more
persoanl reaction. Ruminating on Stéphane Aubier and Vincent Patar’s _A Town
Called Panic _has presented just such a time. I must speak honestly with you,
and decorum just might not hold up for a film as silly as this.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but I don’t get it. This film is oozing international buzz and
everyone else seems to be on the inside of the <em>Panic</em> joke. Most notably it
holds the title as the only feature-length stop-motion film selected for the
Cannes Film Festival. Not since The Hangover have I felt like such an
intellectual outsider. There is no question that <em>A Town Called Panic</em> is a
fun film. It moves at about a mile a minute as our heroes, Cowboy, Indian and
Horse, navigate a stop-motion world filled with toys found in every big kids
toolbelt. Our three heroes go on a zany adventure when someone starts stealing
their house night after night, no matter how many times they rebuild. Always
getting into trouble is the name of the game for these three.</p>

<p>The film isn’t lacking any quirk. Nerds of the world will note that when
Indian orders bricks on the internet, he is using an animated version of
Google’s Chrome browser, certainly a nice polish for a group of misfits such
as this. (It’s a third place browser) The world of the film is seemingly
idyllic, yet the village has that name: Panique. Everyone is a little high
strung. Look guilty of a crime and Policeman might just throw you in jail
without a trial. Certainly, there are a few veiled political statements in
this film, but none cleverly placed enough to snatch my heart.</p>

<p>I will say that children really will love the way this film is put together.
However, American parents might not be so keen to take their kids to a film
with a few mildly naughty subtitles, let alone subtitles at all. The more high
maintenance probably won’t be able to deal with the film’s extreme cartoon
violence, which has gone the ways of the dinosaurs for the most part. For that
I will give these filmmakers a lot of credit. Children’s humor, at least in
this country, has been sterilized so much that fart jokes is almost all they
have left. Aubier and Patar certainly have a leg up on treating children with
a great deal of respect, at least comedically.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am too grown up for this sort of thing, which isn’t as fact I’d
easily admit. It’s easy to write the film off as too simple, or myself as
being too cynical, but I think there is more at work. I think my issue is that
I have seen so many iterations of this kind of film, regardless of whose idea
it was first, that I have grown weary as an audience member. From “Robot
Chicken” to “South Park” to “Spongebob Squarepants”, most of the
subversiveness and quirkiness of animation has been used on me. And so I can’t
figure out how to make heads or tails of this film. I was hoping to have my
socks knocked off, and that just didn’t happen.</p>

<p>So I need you to explain it to me. I need someone, everyone, to help me out in
the comments. I want to like this film. I want to join in the party, but I
just can’t figure out what is getting everyone so hot and bothered about it.
Care to share?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/Still2.jpg" alt="Up in the Air Still" />Up in the Air</em>, director Jason Reitman’s
third feature film, is a moving coming-of-middle-age piece that is a beat for
beat redux of the director’s <em>Thank You for Smoking</em>. This film would feel
stale if it weren’t so damn refreshing. Searing wit and heart-rending reveals
are just two reasons to see this film. George Clooney is another, and in a big
way.</p>

<p>Tossed around as sex-symbol, superhero, goofball and playmate, Clooney steps
up to the plate in this film to portray Ryan Bingham, a jet setting consultant
whose sole purpose is to fire people at companies across the country. A
frequent traveler, Bingham has bought into everything we always thought was so
cool about flying. The compactness, the anonymity, the human ingenuity. Where
most people cringe, he feels at home; and at home, he there are no traces of
an existence. Only someone of Clooney’ charisma could make a vagabond look so
put together.</p>

<p>But since this is a Jason Reitman film, Bingham is not as put together as he
thinks. A part-time motivational speaker, Ryan’s conference shtick is a
depressing speech about cutting the ties you have with loved ones and marrying
one’s work. Dubbed “What’s in Your Backpack?”, his philosophy explains his
lack of interpersonal relationships, but it doesn’t excuse it. When he meets
Alex, played by a firey Vera Farmiga (<a href="http://guru.greencine.com/archives/2009/11/orphan.html">who we didn’t like in
Orphan</a>), all that
machismo flies out the window. Entering into a relationship of serial one-
night stands at airports across the continent, Ryan finally has someone to
care for, which will inevitably lead to his undoing.</p>

<p>There is another level to this film, an economic statement that is glancingly
poignant, but more or less timeless. Each time Ryan fires someone, the film
takes on a documentary feeling, taking the pulse of a tattered economy.
Perhaps the film will be more popular in a time when people are losing jobs in
droves, but Mr. Reitman seems to be thinking bigger. Losing one’s job is a
massive moment for any one person in any time. It is a very personal time of
reflection and self evaluation, and this film hits the nail on the head. Ryan
is the best at getting people to stop being angry and start moving forward
with their lives. This idea, pretty much non-existent in the real corporate
world, is a very interesting take on what many people fear as their darkest
hour.</p>

<p><em>Up in the Air</em> is rife with great performances. Anna Kendrick is hilarious as
the squeaky Natalie Keener, Ryan’s young competition. Her deadpan is
brilliant, delivering Reitman’s choice dialogue with an even sharper tongue
than Ellen Page as Juno. After being the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/05/review-the-twilight-saga-new-
moon/">only redeeming part of
</a><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/05/review-the-twilight-
saga-new-moon/">New Moon</a></em>, she really shines in this film. Also surprising in this film
is Danny McBride, the oafish comedian best known for his role on HBO’s <em>East
Bound and Down</em>. Here, he sets aside his douchebag hat long enough to eek out
a moving, albeit predictable, performance. Jason Bateman joins in the mix with
his weirdest costume to date, and J.K. Simmons delivers a quick little gem.</p>

<p>All in all, <em>Up in the Air</em> is a basic grown-up lovelorn-tale sprinkled with
timely nuance. It’s not necessarily a huge leap for Reitman or Clooney, but
rather both setting up to do what they each do best. And that is okay in my
book. We’re probably looking at an Oscar contender here, which is fine. In
another era this film might be considered average, but today it will really
shock people given how tight it is. In other words, Jason Reitman is fast
becoming one of the more refined active American filmmakers, albeit one who
gravitates toward the same simple story. He will only get better with time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/Fantastic-Mr-Fox.jpg" alt="Fantastic Mr. Fox Still" />Wes Anderson’s first film
adaptation, <em>The Fantastic Mr. Fox</em>, based on Roald Dahl’s book of the same
name, may be the director’s most fully realized piece to date. Witty,
thoughtful and sharp as a tack, this little film is going to astonish
audiences of all ages, and not for the usual reasons we say an animated film
will impress. Written with gifted family dramatist Noah Baumbach, the film is
about the growing pains we all experience at the various stages of life. It’s
also about sentient rodents going to war with big business.</p>

<p>The movie starts off at a sprint, quickly acclimating the viewer to its quirky
animation style. Going vintage, like any hipster should, Mr. Anderson and his
team of animators opted to use stop motion puppets instead of the “cleaner,”
more mainstream digital options. The same problem that befell puppeteer Willis
O’Brien on 1933’s <em>King Kong</em> still exists today as the medium hasn’t changed
all that much. Any time a puppeteer repositions a fur-covered animal between
shots, the hair gets moved around and thus appears to wave around in the final
cut piece, pullulating with every muscular motion. The characters move
extremely fast and the camera whips around this tiny world. In something of a
writerly coup, Mr. Anderson and Mr. Baumbach structure the script to match the
quickened pace of the action. They have composed a heap of dialogue that cuts
like a knife; for a second I thought perhaps Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond
had penned this film, and that’s a hell of a compliment.</p>

<p>George Clooney plays the title character. His vocal energy is probably the
biggest asset to the film, though the entire cast does an amazing job. It is
Mr. Clooney, however, who quickened the pace of his talking and made Mr. Fox’s
bright eyes by backing them up with a deeply developed personality. For better
or worse, I still know I’m watching a movie with Clooney in it, whereas Meryl
Streep, who plays his Mrs. Fox, slyly slips below the radar, disembodying her
celebrity from the role. Jason Schwartzman, Mr. Anderson’s perpetually
adolescent alter-ego, shows off his impeccable comic timing as Ash, Mr. Fox’s
aesthetically challenged son. No one whines like Schwartzman. Eric Anderson,
the director’s brother, and Bill Murray also offer notably hilarious vocal
additions.</p>

<p>Visually, the film resembles many of Mr. Anderson’s other films. We have the
bright, carefully chosen color palette and the overtly symmetrical
cinematography. This works even better in the animated world than it has in
his live action work, mainly due to the fact that over-stylization is the name
of the game in animation. Neither a live-action nor a hand-drawn version of
this film would have worked so well. There is a beautiful concurrence of good
choices happening here. In fact, the subject is perfect for this particular
director’s honed style.</p>

<p>Wes Anderson has spent the bulk of his career making, essentially, the same
film. Many filmmakers do this and some aren’t any worse for wear (how many
times has Woody Allen made the same film and not lost points?), but in
Anderson’s, whatever ghost he was chasing from the outset seems to have been
caught with <em>The Royal Tennebaums</em>. Yet he kept chasing it on two outings.
Fantastic Mr. Fox is something different; a step forward. It most closely
resembles <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, but with the benefit of the director’s years of
experience, which are obvious every step of the way. For one, most of the
family drama is kept to a minimum, focusing more on next-action plot, a rarity
in his talky pictures. It is a great step forward, and I am hopeful to see
more daring exercises from Anderson in the decade to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/new-moon333.jpg" alt="The Twilight Saga: New Moon" />Chris Weitz, who has come a long way
since co-directing <em>American Pie</em> with brother Paul, seems to have approached
the second film in the newly dubbed “Twilight Saga” with the same utter
disregard for proactive development as his predecessor, Catherine Hardwicke.
<em>New Moon</em> is every ounce as boring as the first Twilight film, relying even
more on the deep pockets and low expectations of tweenage girls. However, if
two promising American directors (Hardwicke and Weitz) approached the same
material and turned up dreck in both cases, maybe there is something more at
work here. Maybe the material just sucks.</p>

<p>We find Bella (Kristen Stewart), our helpless heroine from the first
installment, starting her senior year of high school in Forks, Washington, the
cloud covered northwestern town perfect for hiding a family of vampires.
Edward (Robert Pattinson), her fangy boyfriend, throws her a birthday party,
during which his brother tries to eat her. This is standard fare for a family
of vamps with a human mascot. Nonetheless, Edward decides to end his
relationship with Bella. Oh the heartbreak. Luckily, she fills the void in her
heart by spending time with a 16 year old Native American werewolf, Jacob
(Taylor Lautner). Don’t worry, she does go through a period of depression
first; she’s not that much of a monster skank.</p>

<p>New Moon feels more like a supplement to the hefty tome on which it is based;
a celluloid special feature released only to enhance the experience of
committed fangirls rather than bring new ones into the fold. The dialogue is
wooden, the effects are lackluster and the plot never materializes. But that’s
all par for the course, because this movie is really about oggling Robert
Pattinson’s gravity-defying coif and Taylor Lautner’s washboard six pack. It’s
all about the inappropriate eye candy here; sorry boys, Kristin Stewart isn’t
allowed to preen the same way her costars do. That would be illegal.</p>

<p>In many respects, the flocking to Stephanie Meyers’ vampire epic is part of a
cultural phenomenon that has nothing to do with the quality of the work.
Audiences are begging for fantasy series. Ever since <em>Harry Potter</em>
popularized the idea of literature consumed by the pound instead of by the
page (a concept long successful in the mystery, fantasy and science fiction
worlds), audiences and readers alike are desperate for magical characters they
can languish with for hours. This decade began with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>
Trilogy, a nine hour epic that only got more involved once it hit DVD, and
another tryptic of <em>Star Wars</em> films. The experience is now measured in days.
So perhaps the key to <em>The Twilight Saga’s</em> success is about familiarity. It
could be about anything at this point.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Weitz’s failure to make a decently cinematic adaptation, I believe
we can chalk that up to a few overly ambitious production companies. Both the
first film and this one are completely half baked, almost like watching a work
print with first-pass effects work. Ms. Hardwicke was originally attached <em>New
Moon</em>, but left because she didn’t think the script was ready to shoot for a
Thanksgiving release. In other words, Mr. Weitz hopped aboard a Hindenberg
that could have been saved with time. But given the king’s ransom that was
collected upon opening, the joke really is on the rest of us. Oh well, maybe
they’ll make the third one right, but probably not.</p>

but you should definitely prick up your ears and listen to this interview with
their VP of Product, Nate Westheimer. This tenacious tech startup’s plans for
video search have been causing a lot of buzz in the tech community ever since
they won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch50 (think American Idol for
tech companies). The short of their idea: cataloguing every clip ever. Their
flagship site, <a href="http://www.anyclip.com">anyclip.com</a>, is currently in private
beta, but if you land an invite it is definitely a lot of fun to poke around.
You can search through moments in their growing collection of films using
simple terminology, just like any other search engine. Nate describes it
better in our conversation (<a href="http://blog.anyclip.com/post/194942431/why-anyclip">and on the anyclip
blog</a>), so you really
ought to download the audio below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/10/where-the-wild-things-are.jpg" alt="Where the Wild Things Are Still" />Precious. Intimate.
Immediate. Privileged. These are the ways we can describe the various moments
that occur in Spike Jonze’s adaptation of Maurice Sendak’s <em>Where the Wild
Things Are</em>. These terms, which any frosh film student should recognize, are
generally associated with documentary cinema. They have become applicable
here, however, because Mr. Jonze rightly decided to let the pomp and
circumstance that comes with any major studio children’s film fall away,
focusing this film on the rambunctious perspective of a child in flux.</p>

<p>Hyperactive and creative Max is a boy with seemingly no friends but his
mother. Always looking for an adventure to go on, he is stuck in a life of
suburban boredom and Oedipal rage (aren’t we all?). There are a bevy of
Freudian signifiers which lead to Max’s escape from his home on a journey to
the ends of the earth. There he meets the folks we lovingly call “the wild
things” (Buber, anyone?) who take him in as their king. At home with the
beasts, our young ruffian slowly finds that even life in his own private
utopia can get complicated.</p>

<p>And this is where the film gets clunky. Once established as monarch, his job
is simply to make everyone happy again. If that sounds a bit esoteric, you’re
right on target. It would be much simpler if Max had to rescue a princess or
uncover lost treasure, but instead he must achieve and retain happiness. While
the overall lesson, that sustainable joy is hard-won so appreciate what you
have, is of serious value, the idea of watching it for 90 minutes isn’t quite
so fun.&lt;</p>

<p>That’s not to say there aren’t real joys to be had in this film. Mr. Jonze’s
work always seems influenced by what a pain in the ass it actually is to make
a movie. While the sets and characters are larger than life our perspective is
always peripheral. Where a Bryan Singer or Chris Weitz might build up the
sheer grandiosity of this wild world, Mr. Jonze never strays from the
documentary approach. Stark colors, an always moving camera, and a telephoto
viewpoint make the magical aspects of the film seem even more real.
Thankfully, the furry friend’s are (mostly) grounded in reality. Unlike so
many Jar-Jar Binks’, these beasts are tangible yet creative in execution.</p>

<p>Children today have a fairly tough go at the movie theater. They are stricken
mostly to animated fare or whatever Robert Rodriguez has cooked up for his
family, which may as well be a cartoon. The landscape is seemingly bereft of
weightier fare like <em>The Neverending Story</em>,_ The Dark Crystal<em>,</em> <em>or _Time
Bandits</em>. <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> takes a page from that book, offering up
a relatable coming of age amid more dangerous visuals. There’s nothing wrong
with exposing kids to a little of what the Motion Picture Association of
America terms “mild peril”. If only Max’s lesson were a little more thought
out, this may be the talebearer of a new generation of perilous filmmaking.
One can hope.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/10/Sunrise-227.jpg" alt="Sunrise Tippeconnie in 2007" />The candler blog is not just a movie
review website, though we do plenty of that from time to time. Officially,
when people ask me what kind of a website this is, I say “the candler blog is
a film theory and criticism website”, which cinema civilians tend to get a bit
confused by. “Theory?” they ask. What do we mean by that? Myself and Sunrise
Tippeconnie have recorded a Candlercast to help explain that idea. Just like
an egg candler holds an egg up to light to determine its health, we hold films
and pop culture up to our own form of candle. In picking apart the minutiae of
films and filmmaking, we hope to achieve a greater understanding of this art
form.</p>

<p>Sunrise Tippeconnie and I are friends and collaborators who have spent hours
upon hours deconstructing every part of the process of moviemaking over the
years. I would like to share just some of that conversation with you, dear
readers, will join in. On the docket for this first dialogue are the state of
HD and 4K video acquisition. We talk about the usefulness of certain
technologies alongside film, the need for more standardization of cinema
terminologies, and the Charlie Chaplin vs. Buster Keaton complex. What does
all of that mean? You’ll have to listen to find out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="henri-george-clouzots-inferno-lenfer-dhenri-georges-clouzot-dir">Henri-George Clouzot’s Inferno (L’enfer d’Henri-Georges Clouzot), Dir.</h3>
<p>Serge Bromberg &amp; Ruxandra Medrea, France, 2009</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/10/19100977.jpg" alt="Still from Henri-Georges Clouzot's Inferno" />I had never heard of Serge Bromberg
before I went to the New York Film Festival’s screening of his. I thought I
was going to see a restoration of a long lost film when I sat down to <em>Henri-
Georges Clouzot’s Inferno</em> at this year’s New York Film Festival. However,
once Serge Bromberg, the filmmaker behind this curious concoction, took the
stage to begin introduce the film, I learned that it was something else
entirely. Part documentary and part re-enactment, the film is an attempt to
understand Clouzot’s most ambitious failure, a film that would have been
called <em>Inferno</em>. and cinematic excavator who spent countless hours spelunking
the depths of notes, dailies and interviews with every living person connected
to the woebegone film, there simply wasn’t enough to resurrect Clouzot’s most
ambitious failure. Luckily, he recognized that the story of <em>Inferno</em> could
still be told even without all the elements of the original.</p>

<p>Built like a teddy bear with an unending charisma, Mr. Bromberg introduced his
film with a lengthy story that never really ended, his moderator futilely
giving him the wrap-it-up signal. As if with a professorial sleight-of-hand,
his tale ended with him waiting for an elevator with Clouzot’s widow, defeated
as she would not hand over her husband’s stockpile of footage. Once the film
rolled, the story picked right back up where Bromberg had left off, except now
in french. The two got stuck in that elevator and he managed to charm her as
he had us. This playfulness in the screening, one of the hallmarks of a
festival showing, made it quite obvious how the filmmaker gained access to the
extent he did. Still, even as good a cinematic excavator as he is, having
spent countless hours spelunking the depths of notes, dailies and interviews
with every living person connected to the woebegone film, we slowly learn that
there are many missing elements from the project.</p>

<p>The original film was basically the story of a husband who is driven mad by
thoughts of his wife cheating on him. It is unclear whether or not she is up
to anything untoward, but her hubby has nightmares of misdeeds nonetheless.
Already an international success, Mr. Clouzot was able to secure “unlimited”
financing for the project, which quickly became the highest budgeted French
film in history to that point. Ridden with problems ranging from time limits
with the location to sick cast members, the film never came to fruition. Where
this becomes so fascinating to film historians and nerds alike is the role
that Clouzot plays in the French cinema timeline. Originally celebrated, the
French New Wave critics derided him as part of the older school of filmmaking,
dismissing much of his work after the rise of the New Wave. Perhaps the
limtlessness of <em>Inferno</em> did him in, while the newer generation of
constrained filmmakers (small budgets, limited locations, etc.) flourished.</p>

<p>As the titles of both the documentary and the original film imply, the entire
endeavor was about a descent into madness. With his massive budget, Clouzot
began experimenting with some phenomenal special effects, many of which have
been restored for this documentary. I can’t quite describe how these tests
looked, but I can tell you that it is reminiscent of the great Geoffrey
Unsworth’s brilliant work on <em>Superman: The Movie</em> years later. (To give
credit where credit is due, Unsworth used some of Stan Brakhage’s
experimentations in that film, but if any of them could have seen
<em>Inferno</em>…) In one of the most amazing series of tests (illustrated above),
the team painted the actors various colors so they would look human once the
colors were chemically reversed. Initially this was to turn a river red, but
the amount of tests make it seem as though Clouzot had even more in mind.
Bright, ephemeral, and relentlessly inventive, the cinematography itself is
worth the peek if this film comes to your town.</p>

<p>Truth be told, the story that Mr. Bromberg cobbles together from the
breadcrumbs Clouzot left behind is not all that interesting. With his youthful
spirit and encyclopedic knowledge of film, he makes clear the excitement he
had diving into this lost treasure, but in the end there just isn’t enough to
keep our attention. Given that no audio was recovered, some scenes were staged
and cut with footage from the original. Essentially, the task was to spin hay
into gold, but only half the hay was there. An interesting little piece
indeed, but I would much rather have gone on the adventure myself, doubled
over film winders looking for clues to the masterpiece this genius could never
complete. But perhaps Clouzot was smarter than us all and knew that no matter
how out of the box he could go, <em>Inferno</em> would always be a fool’s errand.
Thankfully, Mr. Bromberg was enough of a fool to bring us something to chew
on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="lebanon--dir-samuel-maoz-israel-2009">Lebanon (?????), Dir. Samuel Maoz, Israel, 2009</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10
/lebanon-samuel-maoz-550x309.jpg" alt="Lebanon Still" />Middle Eastern politics are as tenuous as
ever. While filmmakers, artists, politicos and celebrities became entrenched
in a controversy over the Toronto International Film Festival’s decision to
feature films from Tel Aviv this year, a very interesting thing happened
halfway around the world. As voices pointed towards our neighbors to the north
expressed beliefs for or against Israeli cinema, the jury at the Venice Film
Festival gave their top honor, the Golden Lion, to Samuel Maoz’s <em>Lebanon</em>, a
film which chronicles the 1982 Lebanon War from the vantage point of a tank
gunner. We can learn a lot from not only a film like this, but the story that
surrounds it given the timing of its release.</p>

<p><em>Lebanon</em> opens and closes in a field, but that is the only time you will be
outside of an Israeli tank for the entire runtime of the film. Mr. Maoz, who
shares a nickname with the film’s most relatable character, Shmulik, wants to
bring us to the emotional realities of a war he experienced through the sight
scope. It is a bold move and the concept comes off incredibly smooth. The
story keeps moving forward, even though we do not. At the NYFF screening,
cinematographer Giora Bejach quipped that they kept the setting minimal for
budgetary reasons. While this may be true, it’s much nicer to think there was
a bit more intentionality behind the cramped landscape.</p>

<p>As far as war films go, <em>Lebanon</em> is okay. It is a valiant first effort for
Mr. Maoz, who is new to feature filmmaking. The film’s biggest flaw is an
inability to recognize when the audience has gotten the point well enough.
Through some disturbing imagery, we are brought into the real horrors of war.
A disrobed woman searching for her daughter, a disemboweled mule crying on the
side of the road, an elderly truck driver veritably quartered by the blast of
a tank shell. We linger on these sights through the cross-hairs for about
twice as long as we need to emotionally. It reaches the point of manipulation,
which doesn’t give the audience enough intellectual credit. That would be my
sole, albeit weighty, complaint about this film.</p>

<p>The most phenomenal aspect of the film is the creative camerawork within (and
technically without) the tank. The most novel device is using the armored
vehicle’s spotting scope as a point-of-view eye on the action. Whenever
Shmulik looks out onto what is happening, we see a crosshairs on screen. This
is jarring in the kind of way that makes me feel all warm inside. The camera
is now a weapon. As an audience, we must find a way to cope with the actions
of the camera; cope with our actions. Like I said before, we linger for too
long on the most emotionally wrenching scenes, but if there’s a point to that,
it is to point out our complicity with the aberration of war.</p>

<p>Sitting within the belly of the steel beast are four soldiers, each
predictably more fascinating than the next. There is a man-child, a sensitive
type, a class clown, and a confused commander. Together, they navigate their
range of emotions as the war presses on. It is a nice balance, again proof of
Mr. Maoz’s phenomenal entrance into feature films. With time, he will be able
to refine this square character relationship in a way that brings out a more
surprising story. While it may be predictable, it is a real treat to see.</p>

<p>This is the internal struggle of the Israeli soldier. While he must fight to
survive, how can he survive given what he has done. As Mr. Maoz mentioned
after the screening, perhaps the two-plus decades that have passed since this
war have given his generation the strength to tackle the most difficult
questions a people can have about themselves. He noted this after the flurry
of recent internationally recognized Israeli films on the topic, particularly
Ari Folman’s <em>Waltz with Bashir</em>.</p>

<p>What is so odd about the spat that erupted in Toronto over the Tel Aviv films
is that <em>Lebanon</em> is exactly the kind of film that Israel’s detractors would
want to see. It is critical of government policy, questioning of the nation’s
military strength, and speaks to the biggest causes of those who would like to
keep Israel in check. This isn’t to say it is “anti-Israel” by any means,
simply intellectually diverse; a conversation starter, if you will. And, like
many films outside of the U.S., it was made with government funding. I bring
all this up to point out the wide swatch of gray that exists between the black
and white of Middle East arguments. <em>Lebanon</em>, while it may not be the best
Israeli/war film, certainly represents an interesting progression in an ever
changing cinema.</p>
