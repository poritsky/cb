  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

two unassuming fellows who infiltrate business conferences and present
outrageous concepts to captains of industry. Their hope is that people will
see that Big Business has simply spun out of control, and hopefully bring
enough attention to those who can effectively make a change: the people. Andy
Bichlbaum is half of this rag-tag crew whose new film, <em>The Yes Men Fix the
World</em>, chronicles some of their most daring exploits (they call them
“actions”). While Andy may seem like a merry prankster, he and partner Mike
Bonnano take themselves very seriously, as evidenced in this interview. They
want you to laugh, but they also want you to take action. We chatted about his
film, his beliefs, and “The Wave” (no, not that
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-wave-for-
filmmakers-a-concept/">Wave</a>). Listen in and leave the comments below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/10/a_serious_man.jpg" alt="A Serious Man Still" />Oscars in tow, Joel and Ethan Coen
don’t seem to know the meaning of a slow period. Their latest project, <em>A
Serious Man</em>, just like <em>Burn After Reading</em> before it, is a small film with
big ambitions. It is a family drama; it is a memoir of the golden age of
American suburban rabbinic Judaism; it is a study of the intellect’s struggle
with the belief (or disbelief) in a higher power. Acerbically funny and
virtuously moody, this film is yet another feather in the cap of the brothers
Coen.</p>

<p>In a landscape littered with cinematic imposters, <em>A Serious Man</em> features a
main character who can accurately be described as a classic “schlemiel”. Larry
Gopnik, played with remarkable sincerity by Michael Stuhlbarg, is a man who
never asked for anything from God in his life, but when he is faced with trial
upon trial, Mr. Gopnik finds his latent bent to the point of imminent
breakage. A Physics professor at the local university, Larry is an impotent,
small man who gets trampled from every angle. His wife is leaving him, a
student is stong-arming him into a getting a better grade, his pothead son’s
Bar Mitzvah is approaching amid mounting financial pressure, and his awkward
brother takes up the only remaining space in his home.</p>

<p>The Coens make it clear early on that this story is a parable in the Jewish
tradition. The first scene is in Yiddish, in the “old country”. As with the
literature on which it is based, the scene has a clear beginning and middle,
but the ending seems to be up to the viewer. The same goes for the film and
the other parables sprinkled within. The answer is in the questions, so keep
questioning, it would seem.</p>

<p>As Larry spirals deeper into his woeful situation, he hits on one of the great
paradoxes of the intellect: that to refute the existence of a higher power,
one must first accept that it exists to be able to disprove it. He is
surrounded by fervent believers of whom he is jealous; Larry wants to believe
that God will come to his aide. He is even ready to believe that this is all a
test, a lesson of some sort. However, the community’s spiritual guides are not
quite so quick to believe in divine troublemaking. Their faith is so sure,
they would never question God in the way Larry does. Ironically, the Rabbis
Larry consults would rather deny divinity than admit heavenly foul play. Whose
faith is more certain?</p>

<p>Back again are all of the key players of any Coen brothers’ film. Roger
Deakins bring his impeccable photography to the table, working in tandem with
moving musical cues from the always enjoyable Carter Burwell. But my favorite
member in this cabal of creatives has to be Skip Lievsay, whose pointed sound
design continues to astound in every outing. There is such a respect for every
miniscule detail of the frame, inside and out, that makes this team one of the
peak performing cinematic forces on the planet. If it were up to me, they’d
all get a blank check.</p>

<p>However, that would all be for naught if the stories that Joel and Ethan keep
cooking up weren’t worth their weight in matzoh balls. There is a
theatricality, a liveliness to the dialogue in <em>A Serious Man</em>. The push and
pull that Larry must endure may frustrate us, but not to the point of
unenjoyment. Rather, it is this awkward playfulness that draws us in and makes
us feel warm and cozy in this otherwise disorienting film.</p>

<p>Yiddish literature, which is often branded as comedy, is not for the faint of
heart. The laughs are contextual and communal, as in you might not get it if
you weren’t born on a shtetl. In a coup for the lost art of Yiddishkeite, the
Coens manage to transplant ideas from sages of yore into a more modern
setting. Fear not, there is plenty for the Jewish nood to enjoy. After all,
this is an American story, and the Coens are master storytellers when it comes
to the peoples that populate this strange land. Focusing on their inner Jew
(finally, tottelehs!), the effect is only amplified.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/deploy-still.jpg" alt="Still from Attackazoids Deploy!!" />Filmmaker Brian Lonan has a lot to
say about Science Fiction movies, which is a good thing because his new film,
<em>Attackazoids, Deploy!!</em>, is full of killer robots in the future. He joins the
candler blog this week for a chat about all things movies. On Satruday,
<em>Deploy!</em> will be making its world premiere at the Coney Island Film Festival
and he has a booked docket from there on out. It will be a busy few months for
Mr. Lonano, so it’s a good thing we nabbed him when we could.</p>

<p>Tune in and you will also a conversation about the persistence of aging
filmmakers, a gaff involving two Reiners, Werner Herzog’s film school, and
where to find the best pizza in New York City. This week’s candlercast is one
not to be missed. Stream, download, or subscribe below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The following is based solely on the first episode of “Bored to Death”.
Pilots are always tough to get kickstarted, so perhaps I will revisit later in
the season.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/0000059407_20090804090520.jpg" alt="Bored to Death Still" />The easy headline for
snarky yuk-yuk-chasers is that HBO’s latest series, “Bored to Death”, bored
them to death, or some variation of that moldy wordplay. It is mildly
unfortunate that Jonathan Ames’s show has a title destined for such simplistic
panning, but even more unfortunate that it deserves every word and more. It’s
not a boring show; it’s worse. It is a wasted opportunity. With talents as
grand as Jason Schwartzman, Zach Galifanakis, Ted Danson and TV directing
heavyweight Alan Taylor to hold together all that angst, this production
simply deserves a better story.</p>

<p>The premise of “Bored to Death” is actually quite nice. Mentally blocked
Brooklyn writer Jonathan Ames (yeah, the main character is named after the
creator) moonlights as a private detective in hopes of kickstarting his
creative juices. Still working on his second novel as the glow from his his
first one fades, he is a man in search of a muse. The trouble is that the plot
is presented so haphazardly, that description I just gave is based more on
speculation than what I actually saw in the show.</p>

<p>What irks me the most is that nothing emotionally pushes Jonathan into the
role of Craigslist dick-for-hire. Even though we are spoon fed this idea of
him being a down-on-his-luck self-hating New York Jew who turns to the
fantastic as an outlet, the emotinal progression just doesn’t warrant his
descent into the life of a private eye. Furthermore, and this is just one of
those problems about being born after the golden age of the mystery story, the
gumshoe Ames becomes is based more on the visual incarnations of his heroes
than the literary ones. Bogart’s snarl is more an inspiration than Chandler’s
pen. He’s a writer, no? It’s not an entirely fair point, I’ll grant, since
this is a television show, a visual medium.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Mr. Ames’s inspiration for this show comes at least in part from
Dennis Potter’s brilliant BBC series, “The Singing Detective”. That show is a
much more dramatic take on the writer’s reverie, but the similarities are
apparent, particularly the visual and aural flair afforded the scenes of back-
alley sneaking. Where “Bored to Death” falls short is in making the non-
detective Ames incredibly mundane. Where Michael Gambon’s Philip Marlow was a
fascinating man both from the confines of a hospital bed and in his dreams of
solving crimes, Mr. Schwartzman’s Ames is a character all too familiar to
anyone who has ever hung out with a writer. His bumbling sleuth work brings
out the best of the actor’s wit, but it hardly covers up the blandness of his
actual self.</p>

<p>We all wish we could be something that we are not. Jonathan Ames (the
character) wishes to be more than just another impotent half-drunk self-
deprecating Brooklyn writer. Alas, in his efforts to reach redemption it feels
as though he will remain those things and join another group; those who are
just fooling themselves into leading an interesting life only to find they are
just another struggling artist in the sea of opportunity called New York.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/mrmovie-300x286.jpg" alt="Steve Friedman, aka Mr. Movie" />For as long as I can remember, my
father has listened to talk radio to fall asleep. As a boy, I tried to emulate
this mannerism upon receiving my first clock radio. There was a certain charm
to being lulled to sleep by people chatting non-sensically about politics,
current events, and other issues of which I had no vested interest. But on
Sunday nights, sleep would not come so easily. That was the night I actually
listened to the radio; that was the night that Steve Friedman took the
airwaves in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Also known as Mr. Movie, Friedman, who passed away earlier this week, was a
radio host with an encyclopedic knowledge of cinema. Part film critic, part
historian, he was a man who very simply loved movies. Back in the days before
IMDb, the forgetful viewer had a choice of unwieldy tomes such as Halliwells
or Moviehound to keep one’s facts straight. For the unanswerable, or what I
would now call the un-googleable, there was Mr. Movie. “It was the movie where
there was a murder in it…”; “Who was that actor? He always played a bad guy,
except this one time…”; “I think the director was  from Europe…” He always
had an answer and a story to share with his eager listenership.</p>

<p>What is so baffling to a critic of my generation about Mr. Movie is that he
managed to retain an incredible amount of information before the advent of
home video. The bulk of the movies he would discuss, Hollywood classics, are
films he would have seen in the theater, maybe only a handful of times. He was
a film buff who never grew up. Up to his dying day (he passed away a few hours
after a broadcast), Mr. Movie never lost that childish love of movies.</p>

<p>One memory that sticks out for me was listening to how fondly he spoke of the
1985 film <em>Explorers</em>. On it’s face, <em>Explorers</em> is a children’s film. Three
friends build a spaceship out of an abandoned tilt-a-whirl car after they all
experience the same dreams. Upon reaching the mothership that sent them the
plans for the spacecraft, they find that their extraterrestrial pen pals are
actually just kids, who are in trouble for making such a long distance call.
Given that his favorite film, according to <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-insider/Steve_Friedman.html">Philly.com’s
obituary</a>,
was <em>Forbidden Planet</em>, it is no wonder that he would lean so favorably
towards a sci-fi flick for youngsters.</p>

<p>To the mind of someone like Mr. Movie, there is no distinction between a good
arthouse movie and a good blockbuster. A good movie is a good movie. As
viewers and critics, we can only strive to be as democratic in our approach as
the man they called Mr. Movie. He will be missed.</p>

/blaynesmall-300x226.jpg" alt="Blayne Weaver" />I first met filmmaker Blayne Weaver back at the
Deadcenter Film Festival in June, where his film <em>Weather Girl</em> was playing.
You can read what I thought about it back then <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/13/deadcenter-review-weather-girl/">in this
post,</a>
but we’re way past reviewing the film at this point. <em>Weather Girl</em> will be
making its television debut tomorrow, Septermber 23, 2009, on the Lifetime
channel. <a href="http://www.mylifetime.com/node/1999414">You heard right, Lifetime.</a></p>

<p>Blayne took some time out of his schedule to chat with me about this current
film, his next project, and topics as varied as digital distribution,
<em>Inglourious Basterds</em>, and screening your film on a PS3. In other words, if
you take the time to swallow this whole interview, you’ll be in for more than
one surprise. Check it out and check the movie tomorrow night, on Lifetime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/community-nbc-joel-mchale-cast.jpg" title="The Cast of Community" /></p>

<p>If you managed to sidestep the ads for &ldquo;The Jay
Leno Show&rdquo;, NBC probably rammed you in the face with hundreds of plugs for their latest scripted series,
&ldquo;Community&rdquo;. Even if you&rsquo;re a shut-in who deplores network comedies, actor Joel McHale probably reminded you
to tune in on every episode of &ldquo;The Soup&rdquo; this summer. Well, I took the bait and plopped down to watch it last
night. As with any first episode I left it feeling underwhelmed. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just the difficulty of pulling
off a pilot and introducing so many characters that caused the episode to flatline. More likely, it&rsquo;s just not
all that funny of an idea.</p>

<p>Mr. McHale plays Jeff Winger, a fast talking fratty lawyer who must go back to community college after the bar
discovers his illegitimate degree. You know that guy; that white guy with cool hair that can talk you into
anything. Think Zach Morris without the moral hangups. Jeff tries to impress cutie Britta (Gillian Jacobs) by
starting a Spanish study group, which balloons into a whole mess of quirky folks converging to form a
modern-day Sweat-hogs. Oddly, Jeff, a fellow student, plays Mr. Kotter in this case, except he can date the
students. Kinky.</p>

<p>The simple problem with &ldquo;Community&rdquo; is that it rehashes the worst stereotypes of community colleges. The idea
that they are for dropouts, jocks, the aging and all-out failures like Jeff Winger simply isn&rsquo;t true. They are
a vital part of our educational ecosystem which offer a very strong option to students of all levels who may
not make the leap to other schools immediately. By its very nature, the show is elitist, classist and maybe a
few more -ists. In truth, I wouldn&rsquo;t care if it were a bit funnier.</p>

<p>Case in point: there was a shark week joke. We get it, ha ha, now let&rsquo;s move on to some fresh material. I am
excited, with reservations, to see how well they utilize Danny Pudi as Abed, a quirky (quirky!)
Palestinian-American who probably has Asperger&rsquo;s. (Another &ldquo;Community&rdquo; joke: &ldquo;he he, Ass burgers&rdquo;) He&rsquo;s
charming in the role, but I fear that the reliance on his blank stare and stilted outbursts will become old
hat very fast.</p>

<p>Another actor I am excited to see on the show is Alison Brie, who here plays Annie &ldquo;Adderall&rdquo;. She is better
known as Trudy, Pete Campbell&rsquo;s wife, on &ldquo;Mad Men&rdquo;. She&rsquo;s still bringing the whiny, but there is a splendor to
her that I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on. Here she has to make a recovering drug addict relatable and funny.
Once they hit an Annie-centric episode we will really see Ms. Brie&rsquo;s chops put to the test.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Chevy Chase is on it. Whatever.</p>

<p>Community could become great, but it&rsquo;s going to be an uphill battle. There isn&rsquo;t much originality happening
for now, but like I said, it&rsquo;s difficult to judge by a pilot. Let&rsquo;s check back in in a few weeks and see how
the students at Greendale are doing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The following is an interview conducted and composed by friend of the candler
blog, Daniel Kremer. Dan is a filmmaker with a knack for cinematic criticism
and historical deconstruction. His <a href="http://confluencefilmblog.blogspot.com/">ConFluence Film
Blog</a> is definitely worth a read. Mr.
Kremer asked that I repost the article here, and I have to thank him for it.
Any access granted to the mind of Henry Jaglom is wholly welcome among candler
readers. <a href="http://confluencefilmblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/two-well-oiled-
machines-exclusive.html">Dan originally posted this a few days ago on his own
website</a>__. It’s a long one, so I’ve split it into a few
pages, don’t miss the controls at the bottom.</em></p>

<p>Once upon a time, long long ago—but, on the other hand, not really long ago at
all—there existed an extraordinary, well-oiled machine. Created by the finest
hands in all the land of Germany and ultimately an invention of great luster
and beauty, the wondrous well-oiled machine was dubbed the Keller-Elektro-
Mechanik Flatbed, and those who grew to know it and love it called it the Kem.
This well-oiled machine turned a world on its ear and made the lives of those
who used it all the easier. It swept all lands, impressing artisans known and
unknown with the exhilarating quality of its facility. One day, however, great
wizards from the yonderland of the Valley of Silicon fashioned a grease-
lightning fast well-oiled machine that began sweeping the land, usurping the
quickness, luster and beauty of the once-great Kem. Once again, the world was
turned on its ear.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sqx2dvvYrrI/AAAAAAAAAec
/cHKzTYsj-rc/s1600-h/KEM.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sqx2dvvYrrI/AAAAAAAAAec/cHKzTYsj-rc
/s320/KEM.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, so not so much of a fairy-tale. My apologies for the botched conceit.
Nevertheless, the truth of the matter at hand is still in there. The Kem, this
so-called well-oiled machine, really did turn the world of film editing on its
ear when filmmakers began using it in the late 1960’s in larger and larger
volume. The Kem one-upped the Moviola, more or less trumping all other editing
methods with the facility of its use—and when computer software became
increasingly sophisticated, the well-oiled machine that was once so super-
sophisticated went the way of the dodo. Despite this, there were still those
who remained admirably committed, contriving to hang on for as long as they
feasibly could. One of these filmmakers, and perhaps the last one to
completely let go, is the one who many cineastes would call the independent’s
independent, writer-director Henry Jaglom, who is very much like a well-oiled
machine himself (considering the fact that he is working on five projects
simultaneously).</p>

<p>Prodigious and prolific are two words that leap to mind when you consider
Henry, and these are two of the qualities I personally admire most about him.
He is currently hard at work promoting his latest release <em>Irene in Time</em>,
editing his upcoming film <em>Queen of the Lot</em> (a sequel to 2006’s <em>Hollywood
Dreams</em>), producing and seeing to the editing of the filmed version of his
play <em>Always But Not Forever</em>(adapted from his 1985 film), writing and re-
writing a new play entitled_Just 45 Minutes from Broadway_ and planning to
shoot his next feature film. Each of these projects star actress Tanna
Frederick, who made her debut in his <em>Hollywood Dreams</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sqx3UOcKq0I/AAAAAAAAAek
/Ws_eR7lYAzg/s1600-h/HJOW.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sqx3UOcKq0I/AAAAAAAAAek/Ws_eR7lYAzg
/s320/HJOW.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I had the privilege of meeting and getting to know Henry personally in 2006
and, even prior to that, we had been e-mail pen pals (beginning in 2004-ish),
writing back and forth about films old, new, domestic, foreign, you name
it…and, of course, about filmmaking as well. We have continued our
correspondence and have known each other for these years now. In the summer of
2008, I was given the unique opportunity in being invited into Henry’s editing
room to watch him work on his latest film. Immediately, what struck me as I
entered the editing room was, “Okay, where ya hidin’ the computer here,
Henry?” Even though I was aware he still edited on a flatbed, it didn’t really
hit me until I walked into an editing room furnished with several celluloid-
filled bins and, of course, the well-oiled Kem, complete with pieces of
memorabilia hanging on the wall. He switched on his 8-plate Kem and started
working diligently on the ending of his film. For a reasonable portion of the
day, I watched him physically splice, cut, paste, wind, rewind and do all
manner of things to his 35mm film elements—in a sense, watching both well-
oiled machines at work. He would present me his guest, and his assistant
editor Simone Boudriot with options and versions of the ending, only to, like
a brim-hatted jack-rabbit, reposition those elements yet again in an almost
lightning-fast way to present us with another version. This was a true sight
to see.</p>

<p>Once a close personal friend of Orson Welles, and the last one to hear from
him the night before the morning the movie legend died, Henry has carved a
more than respectable existence for himself being the independent’s
independent. He has never willfully directed a film for the studio system and
helms films made his way and his way only. His distribution process is another
fascinating aspect of his operation, also running like a well-oiled
machine—all in all, a practical (and inspirational) business model for
independent filmmaking. His company, Rainbow International Releasing,
distributes the Monty Python films here in the United States.</p>

<p><em>Henry with co-editor Ron Vignone, photo credit: Tanna Frederick</em></p>

<p>The Jaglom way of working is a very singular way of working in that,
ostensibly much the way Cassavetes made films, everything is written in detail
beforehand and then, when shooting, the actors will take the reins and fulfill
the intentions of the written scenes without adhering so strictly to anything
written prior. He then, alone as writer, director <em>and_editor, finds the film
in the editing room. It was with this knowledge that I was curious to see how
Henry coped with having to switch to editing on a computer after decades of
working on a flatbed and being initially resistant to the prospect of working
any other way. Also, for the first time ever, he is working on Final Cut Pro
not just with himself but also with a co-editor, filmmaker Ron Vignone
(director of _Say I Do</em> and the upcoming documentary <em>The Back Nine</em>).</p>

<p>When I asked Vignone recently how Henry was enjoying working for the first
time on Final Cut Pro, his response was simply, “Dan, he’s loving it! He’s
having a blast!” Needless to say, I was quite surprised and started asking Ron
more questions. So, eventually, I decided to schedule an interview with Henry
to explore this subject. I found myself quite curious to hear what he had to
say about the digital revolution and how it has affected his workflow as
someone long-acclimated to a certain way of working.</p>

<p><strong>DK: Let’s start simple and point-blank. It would seem you’ve been resistant to personally using computer editing systems since their inception. What ultimately led to the decision to change over?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> You know, I remember when I was in London shooting <em>Déjà Vu</em>, [Monty Python alumnus] Terry Jones took me in to edit something with him. He showed me how computer editing was done and assured me that I’d love it. My feeling then was that I never would, because I couldn’t learn the technology and would somehow miss my whole laborious process—and I am amazed in working with Ron Vignone to say that this is not at all the case. Watching Ron edit a movie version of what he filmed of my play <em>Always But Not Forever</em> was really revelatory. I know it wouldn’t have worked without someone who can do it as amazingly well as Ron can, who is wonderfully skilled and inventive and who has very similar tastes to my own, which is easy for me. And you know personally how difficult I can be on occasion and to be around all the time, particularly in the editing room. Ron is quite simply, really brilliant as an editor, yet open to my needs and my specific, idiosyncratic creative energy. So far I haven’t been tempted to edit a single thing on my own though I had an important and complex dinner scene transferred to 35mm so that I could work on it while he was doing other stuff yet haven’t ever sat down at my editing table where the spools are still left on it to do a single cut myself. I thought this would be a big adjustment, but it really wasn’t. I now wish I had actually listened to Terry Jones back in — what was it — ‘95 maybe.<br />
<strong>DK: Can you talk about having been among the first filmmakers to have used the Kem for editing? **<br />
**HJ:</strong> Orson absolutely insisted that I use it. He told me then that editors would resist the Kem because it was so simple to use that filmmakers would learn how to do it themselves and would not want the editors to come in and edit in their place, and he was right. He always said, and I agree, that filmmakers and directors should edit their films themselves. You really and truly gain an intimacy with the material that you almost always lose when someone else comes in to do it in your place. To me, it’s like a painter calling someone in and telling him what colors to use on the canvas. In 1971, on my first film, when the editor assigned to me by BBS Productions for my film <em>A Safe Place</em> [with Tuesday Weld, Jack Nicholson and Orson Welles] fell asleep one day under some drug influence, I took over and found that I really loved editing and that it was essential for me, and no one else, to do it in the future.<br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sq7YPZZUKRI/AAAAA
AAAAe8/IxtKy5TygPY/s1600-h/Safe+Place.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sq7YPZZUKRI/AAAAAAAAAe8/IxtKy5TygPY
/s320/Safe+Place.jpg" alt="" /></a>**DK: So this guy who they hired to
edit really fell asleep under the influence while at the actual editing table?
Doesn’t sound like a very productive working relationship. **</p>

<p><strong>HJ:</strong> I remember his name was Howard Awk or Alk, he was famous at the time in certain hip circles for having made or edited a film with Bob Dylan. He was a friend of Dylan’s, a graduate of the Second City and had been hired by Bert, from whom I had gotten the Kem. He got high, it seemed, a lot. So it was just when this guy fell asleep at the Kem a couple of times that I decided that he was no-go, and then somehow I convinced Bert [Schneider] to let edit it myself, and so I hand-edited my next—what was it?—14 or 15 films. And it seemed to me that, with my way of working and not having each scene shot over and over again with different coverage and different angles and whatnot, and with so much improvisation, no one else could possibly put it together except me. In all reality, I write my films in the editing room. I always go into a project with a script, but it is never ever used verbatim, so the actors fulfill the intentions of the written scene without my imposing any rigid directions on them. Then, later in the editing room, I in a sense rewrite the scene with the emotional reality that the actors give me. So with that in mind, the fact that I am finding the movie in the editing process is the reason that I was the only one who could edit my films.<br />
<strong>DK: I agree. It is <em>your</em> process, and that’s just it.</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> I also remember when I was directing <em>A Safe Place</em>, we were shooting a scene and I was telling them what shot I wanted, and everyone in the camera department and continuity kept on telling me, “You can’t do that! It’s not gonna cut!” And I kept trying to convince them that it would, and it got to the point where I became so frustrated, I went over to Orson, kvetched a bit and asked his advice. He told me, “Tell them it’s a dream sequence.” At first, I was confused because it wasn’t a dream sequence, but he told me that if you told people you were shooting a dream sequence, they would put aside any resistance towards your wishes and that they would do whatever you want. So I went back and told the cameraman that it was a dream sequence we were shooting, and he told me, “Well, why didn’t you say so? I can put the camera over here and do all kinds of crazy things.” <em>[laughing]</em> So, basically, no one else could see the vision I had for the edited product, so that was just more evidence that I was the only one who could do it.  </p>

<p><strong>DK: You’re working very closely with a co-editor, Ron Vignone, for the first time. How would you describe that working dynamic, considering the fact that you edited your own films by yourself from the beginning of your career?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> It’s been easy and terrific! Ron knows all my work and my taste so well. He was always at my side during the writing of <em>Queen of the Lot_and during the whole shooting of it as well. Seeing Ron do what he did on _Always</em> convinced me to try this new system out, and working with him on that scene at the end of <em>Irene in Time</em> further convinced me, and now I am completely sold and spoiled, letting him do all the complex first roughs while I finish re-writes on my new play and work on my Jewish history book. If it weren’t for Ron, I’d be sitting at my Kem for endless hours, going over to the shelves to take out reel after endless reel, putting each one on my flatbed and looking, cutting, rewinding, looking, cutting, rewinding, looking, cutting…for hundreds of hours.<br />
<strong>DK: What have you learned about yourself and about your process as a result of this shift, and your adoption of using new filmmaking technology, if anything? Have you also learned anything about your process from working with a co-editor for the first time? Did anything surprise you?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> I really haven’t learned much directly as a result of the change of process. I was definitely quite surprised at how much faster it is, and how much easier.<br />
<strong>DK: I recall years ago now how you marveled at watching a two-minute short film of mine online, and your telling me how lucky I was to be coming of age as a filmmaker in the age of the Internet, when distribution was easy and turnaround time was so fast. Do you wish that you yourself had come of age as a filmmaker during the digital filmmaking revolution considering its advantages in the realm of production and distribution?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> No, not at all. I like everything having been exactly as it was, and I’ve never wished retroactively for things to have been different. That is science fiction and it doesn’t interest me, nor do I find it constructive to think about how things could have been different, because each film I have made is a perfect representation of who I was at the time it was made. So how could I possibly want it to be any other way?<br />

/s320/HenryJaglom.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>DK: On a very general basis,
what do you think of the phenomenon—that Joe Schmo from Oatmeal, Nebraska can
access a digital camera very easily, pick it up and make a film on his own
with very little resources and very little money? The digital revolution has
furthered opened the door to regional filmmaking, which excites me as a
filmmaker. However, do you think this new accessibility has opened the flood-
gates for products of a decidedly lesser quality? How does that make you feel
as a filmmaker?</strong></p>

<p><strong>HJ:</strong> I am happy for everyone who now gets a chance who wouldn’t have in the past. I think this is really and truly great. It’s the best thing that could have happened, and I am not really at all concerned with a perceived loss of collective quality of work.<br />
<strong>DK: Were you initially amazed at the immediate results inherent in computer editing (e.g. that you can color correct without going to a chemical color-timer or that you can fade, mix audio, dissolve or superimpose titles onto images without optical printing)? Were there any other surprising revelations that you discovered when you chose to adapt to the new technology?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> No real surprise there. I did know all this, but who doesn’t know this? It’s so out there now, it seems like. That’s what is so amazing!<br />
<strong>DK: Considering the way you work and your artistic process, have you found it easier or more difficult to edit improvised scenes with the new system?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> Both really. I remember Orson watching me edit improvisational acting one day when I was putting together <em>Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?</em>, him sitting behind me and smoking his Monte Cristo and being utterly fascinated as I made it up as I went along, amazed when I took a bit of someone’s dialogue out of one mouth and put it in another, or taking just syllables here and words there and as a result re-writing whole scenes, changing whole sentences and making several actors look as if they were saying things that they never actually said. But I am enjoying watching Ron edit the scenes and then showing it to me and then working on it with him, and so on, like I guess more traditional directors do, and the speed with which all this can be done amazes and delights me, what would have taken me weeks can be done in one sitting. It’s liberating.<br />
<strong>DK: To quote your mentor Orson Welles, “I believe it is possible to spoil a young filmmaker with too much privilege, too much money and too much comfort so that he does not learn one of the main arts of directing, which is the ability to walk away from something.” Do you think that it is in turn possible to spoil young filmmakers with the advantages of the digital format?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> I don’t know where you got this quote, but Orson said thousands of things, whatever came to his mind at the moment he said, and never seriously thought about this. Don’t take what you read seriously, people say all sorts of things. And I don’t believe something like this can spoil a young filmmaker. Quite the contrary, it opens up the form for people. I have always encouraged the growth of digital filmmaking for all it allows young and beginning filmmakers, but have just never been interested in working within it myself, until now.<br />
<strong>DK: I know a few people who feel that way, that computer editing spoils you to the point where you can’t think and consider fully what you’re doing because it is so fast that you want to do it and the next minute, it’s done…no extended thought process that one would get from winding, cutting, splicing, watching.</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> I do understand what you’re saying. I just think that the more open the medium and the form is, the more interesting the results are ultimately going to be.<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sq_2cmyQGB
I/AAAAAAAAAfM/jkT0mqps3ZA/s1600-h/Directing-Jaglom1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sq_2cmyQGBI/AAAAAAAAAfM/jkT0mqps3ZA
/s320/Directing-Jaglom1.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>DK: In any case, do
you see your beginning to use editing software as a gateway for you to in the
future shoot digitally on HD, or are you faithfully committed in sickness or
health to shooting in 35mm?</strong></p>

<p><strong>HJ:</strong> I really have no commitment to anything like that now. But who knows? It could go either way, I don’t know yet. At various points throughout my editing process, I screen the films in rough cut form. I would always have to take the work-print to the lab and get it transferred at various stages to a DVD. Another perk is that this new process cuts down on that expense as well, and you can make DVDs at various points without that hassle. So the more I am seeing the various perks of doing things digitally, the more I become open to further changes.<br />
<strong>DK: Does 35mm editing still have any advantages over digital editing?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> One thing I can say is that I no longer feel like an artisan, like I used to—the feeling of what it is to work with your hands. One of the best things about working in film on a Kem and on any flatbed is feeling the film between your fingers on the editing table and watching light pass through the actual elements when you’re editing. There’s just nothing like it. So, if there is anything I miss, it is that. I am not so sure you can feel anything even akin to that when you edit on a computer. It’s just very different.<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sq_3f6nDKTI/AAAAAAA
AAfc/JiL_ZBPVTs4/s1600-h/47549380.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YCHkHffSqS8/Sq_3f6nDKTI/AAAAAAAAAfc/JiL_ZBPVTs4
/s320/47549380.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>DK: On a lighter note, I remember you
saying that you intended to make a film for every letter of the alphabet (i.e.
A for <em>Always But Not Forever</em>, B for <em>Babyfever</em>, C for <em>Can She Bake a
Cherry Pie? _, D for _Déjà Vu</em>, E for <em>Eating</em>, F for_Festival in Cannes_,
etc). Is this still a goal and do you think the quickness of computer editing
can facilitate that goal?</strong></p>

<p><strong>HJ:</strong> <em>[laughing]</em> Yes, it’s still a goal…if I live long enough to see to it. Editing on a computer is quick, so we shall see.<br />
<strong>DK: A great teacher of mine once said, “If one studies history, one should begin at the beginning. Therefore, filmmakers just starting out should learn how to shoot on film elements before moving onto video in order to understand the roots of filmmaking.” Do you think fledgling filmmakers should first, or at some point, learn how to shoot and edit on film with a flatbed to understand from hence and whence we came?</strong><br />
<strong>HJ:</strong> There are no rules, and I believe anyone who preaches rules is missing something really valuable. Everyone is different and should approach making films in any way he or she thinks is best, most importantly no one should listen to anyone else who tells them that there is a right and wrong way to do things….just do them and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t. That is the best advice I can give…to not let anyone tell you, “No, you can’t.” And the digital age makes that more possible for people, in my belief. I’ve made a career out of telling people, “Yes I can!” If I can make that “Yes I can” happen from editing on 35mm, they can make it happen with the new ways made available!<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[caption id=”attachment_1633” align=”alignright” width=”377” caption=”Promo
Artwork for DJ Danger Mouse’s The Grey
Album”]<img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/GreyAlbumCrop.png" alt="GreyAlbumCrop" />[/caption]</p>

<p>I bet when DJ Danger Mouse was mixing down John Lennon’s ephemeral finger
picking from “Julia” over Jay- Z’s evocative lyrical stylings on “Moment of
Clarity”, he never thought a day would come when the two musical behemoths
would actually duke it out on the music charts. Alas, that week has come (or
gone, really).</p>

<p>A day apart from each other, Jay-Z released his 3rd Blueprint album (aptly
titled The Blueprint 3) while The Beatles entire catalog was re-released in
varying forms. Fully remastered over a four year period which you can read (a
tiny bit) about
<a href="http://www.thebeatles.com/#/news/The_Beatles_Remastered2/">here</a>, all 13
studio albums plus the Past Masters Vols. were unleashed separately as well as
in mono and stereo box sets. That’s a whole load of familiar albums to compete
for listeners dollars. Still depending on how you count, Jay-Z hit the top of
the charts by moving 476,000 units in the first week.</p>

<p>Back to that counting thing. If you include everything that Apple Corp. let
loose last week, The Beatles moved a whopping 1.1 million units. More than
twice as many discs for only 15 times as much content! Because the albums are
re-releases, the only items eligible for the music charts were the box sets,
which sport brand new SKU#s. Believe it or not, baby boomers and audiophiles
shelled out en masse, bringing the stereo set to the 15 spot, selling 26,000
of the gigantic collection. Even the more obscure mono set made it number 40
with 12,000 collectors investing in aural purity.</p>

<p>So what does any of this mean? Well, the boys from Liverpool may be the
greatest rock band of all time, but that doesn’t make the longevity of their
relevance a given. Youngsters today are growing up with parents who think Bon
Jovi is classic rock. An entire generation is growing up without the legend of
The Beatles. In other words, the music doesn’t actually sell itself. It needs
help from people like Julie Taymor and her “controversial” <em>Across the
Universe</em>. Whichever side of the blasphemy aisle you may find yourself on,
that film got tweenage girls singing “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)” while
hanging out by their lockers. Mix that with the prepubescents noodling on
Beatles: Rock Band and you see that they can stay relevant as long as the
music is allowed to grow with the times.</p>

<p>And then there’s DJ Danger Mouse’s <em>The Grey Album</em>, that genius bit of
artistry that set off a flurry of Frankenstein tracks (aka “mashups”) a few
years ago. Although the album was a copyright lawyer’s nightmare, so much so
that it was never released officially, it proved not only the artistic
legitimacy of Jay-Z to raps naysayers, but the resiliency of John, George,
Paul, and Ringo’s music in an era when seemingly anyone can be a rock star. As
time goes on, we can only imagine what artists will think of next to do with
the amazing palette that is the music of The Beatles.</p>

<p>For now, Jay-Z is still the king.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

an institution, aired its last episode from Burbank California. The sets were
broken down and the latest iteration of the late night show moved to Universal
City under the tutelage of Conan O’Brien. As had been decided earlier,
however, the one relic that would not budge was Jay Leno, the eponymous host
of NBC’s newest daily program, “The Jay Leno Show”. After a violet blitzkrieg
of summer advertisements, the show premiered last night looking,
unfortunately, all-too familiar.</p>

<p>As his former show waned, Mr. Leno only let on a few details about what the
new 10pm program would look like. One tidbit was that there would be no desk
for him to prop up behind as that was the calling card of The Tonight Show.
Apparently, the desk was the only casualty. Mr. Leno now sits in a chair,
fully exposed, opposite his guests as they blab on about their personal lives.
Whoa, revolutionary.</p>

<p>I had pretty high hopes for “The Jay Leno Show”.  You may remember <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/02
/opinion-tonight-show-is-safe-with-conan/">I praised
Conan for his work in the 11:30 space</a>, where he is doing exactly what Jay
was. The trouble is this whole time slot issue. At 10:00 I want something
different that what I want at 11:30, and I really thought Jay could deliver.
Nix the monologue, maybe, and do round table jokes about topics of the day.
Throw in more sketches, perhaps, that evoke more of an SNL daily. I thought
maybe the format of the show would change in a manner that really would force
us to reconsider what we expect at 10:00. It hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<p>While I believe that Jay is a real sweetheart, I’ve never found him all that
funny. Unaware of the back story, as a kid I found it odd that the gap-toothed
hilarious guy on after Johnny Carson didn’t get his job. He has a talented
slew of writers who keep things fresh, but his delivery has always been
stilted, in my opinion. He doesn’t sell me the punchline; he kinda just lobs
it at the wall and sees what sticks.</p>

<p>The premiere’s major moment was an unplanned sit-down interview with Kanye
West, who was performing with Jay-Z and Rhianna. Mr. West apologized for an
outburst at MTV’s Video Music Awards the night before in which he took the mic
from Taylor Swift as she was accepting an award. What transpired was a few
minutes of televised horse-shit, schlock, cheap puffery. Call it what you
will, it was still what a slimy studio pimp might call “good TV”. After an
apology of sorts, Jay asked Kanye what his deceased mother would say about his
actions. A hardball question, indeed, but one that has no purpose except to
get Mr. West welled up inside and act like a person instead of the inflated
celebrity we see all the time. It was very low of Mr. Leno, towards both Mr.
West and Ms. Swift, whose moment of glory was once again been overblown by
hip-pop’s shining star.</p>

<p>I’m sure that Mr. Leno does not forget his interview with a scandalized Hugh
Grant back in 1995. The episode propelled him over Letterman in the late night
ratings. Trying to strike oil twice? This isn’t the way to do it. While Leno
may be the talk of the town for confronting a pop headline, he will still have
to bring the funny every night in order to stay relevant. I give it 3 months
before NBC, who ousted deal-maker Ben Silverman, gets wise to the situation
and brings some drama back at 10:00.</p>
