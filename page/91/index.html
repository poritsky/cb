</a>While we’re doing our own
research on the topic here at the candler blog, there is a <a href="http://www.bigscreen.com/journal.php?id=1505">great article on
the differences in IMAX screen sizes over at The Big Screen Cinema
Guide</a>. After <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/13/reblogged-aziz-ansari-is-
angry-at-imax/">Aziz Ansari’s
consumer rant</a> exploded across the internet earlier this week, it’s been a
big topic of conversation. The Big Screen folks put in layman’s terms the
differences in screen size. This may not be a technological issue but a
marketing one. IMAX technicians have their own terminology for the bigger and
smaller screens, maybe we as consumers should have one too. We’ll be getting
deeper into this next week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/apr2009/8/0/star-trek-the-new-crew-pic-
rex-sm-119862879.jpg" alt="" />“Live long and prosper” is the least that one could say
about the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise. Over four decades have passed since the first
incarnation of Gene Roddenberry’s brainchild. The original series, known for
it’s cheese and moral pomp, ran a mere three seasons, but nonetheless inspired
eleven movies, five television series, countless books, toys, videogames and,
above all, generations of space enthusaists and geeks. Daunting, then, is the
task of re-introducing the classic characters onto the big screen. Thankfully,
director and television impresario J.J. Abrams rises to the occasion to make
<em>Star Trek</em> (it’s actually the first film to bear that name alone) not only a
welcome addition, but an inspired thrill-ride which really kicks summer 2009
into gear.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/08/review-x-men-origins-
wolverine/">some other 2009
blockbuster</a>, screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have crafted a
legitimate origin story for the franchise. The film opens with Captain Kirk
and Mr. Spock as children on their respective planets showing a distinct
promise of greatness. Over the years, the Star Trek galaxy has become so vast
that the characters within it seem to have shrunk in stature, considered more
to be model citizens of the Federation than anything more. By focusing on the
early years of these two shipmates, Mr. Abrams is emphasizing that Kirk, Spock
and their cohorts are not the norm; they are extraordinary; they are
superheroes.</p>

<p>Any remake (rehash or reboot, whichever you prefer) suffers from comparison to
its forebears, but Mr. Abrams and friends have found the perfect plot to
circumvent continued scrutiny, opening up poetic leeway for the assumed
sequels to come. The plot is simple yet elegant, laid out in a perfect linear
manner. As I said before, this is a true origin story, and all of the hero
story beats hit on every mark. The added fun here is that our two main
characters, Spock and Kirk, antiphonally fill the shoes of student and teacher
for each other. This push and pull of one hero against another is not only
fascinating, it’s great fun to watch.</p>

<p>Chris Pine slips nicely into the captain’s chair as James T. Kirk, the role
that made William Shatner a household name. Ditching the Shat’s signature
pentameter, Mr. Pine retains the attitude of the original of the character
without delving into impersonation. Confident, skilled, smug and dead sexy,
this is the Kirk we have all known for so long but in a more youthful body.
Similarly, Zachary Quinto dons the pointy ears of Mr. Spock, but imbues the
character with his own brand of emotional sophistication. He feels a little
more relatable than Leonard Nimoy was in the same role, I want to say more
human. This is a wonderful progression for Spock and I can’t wait to see where
Mr. Quinto takes this.</p>

<p>The other performances are what some would call impersonation, but what I
would call skilled homage. My personal favorite is Karl Urban as Leonard
“Bones” McCoy. Mr. Urban pulls off a perfect young DeForest Kelley, who played
the role originally; he offers up that recognizable gruffness while
introducing his own bright-eyed views of space travel. The same goes for
British funnyman Simon Pegg as Montgomery Scott, or Scotty. While his
resemblance to a young James Doohan is not as noticeable, he does reprise the
signature wit and charm of the Scotch engineer.</p>

<p>Also, Bruce Greenwood broods as the aging Captiain Christopher Pike and Anton
Yelchin provides some xenophobic laughs as Pavel Chekov. The only egregious
misstep is the role of Lieutenant Uhura, in which Zoë Saldana does her best to
hold her own as the lone woman on the bridge but can’t quite rise above her
designation as eye-candy. It is unfortunate that a series so dedicated to a
unified Earth still relies on things like Chekov’s pronounciation of the
letter “V” or Uhura’s sex appeal to keep people grounded. Ms. Saldana is
certainly the loser here, because while we get to see Chekov’s technical
acumen and heart of gold on display, all we really see of Uhura is her thighs.</p>

<p>Visually we are offered inspired eyefuls from the first frame to the last. The
special effects are a wonder and the action scenes are enthralling,
particularly a duel featuring Mr. Sulu coming out of his intellectual shell.
The cinematography itself is fine, but I wonder about the extensive use of
lens flair throughout. On one level, it enhances many shots by adding an extra
layer of information to the frame. Still, it seems to take away more than it
adds and serves no emotional purpose as it did in Paul Thomas Anderson’s
<em>Punch Drunk Love</em>. Director of photography Dan Mindel may not pull in any
awards for this film, but he sure as hell can make an action scene come
together with incredible flair (no pun intended). I’d be remiss if I didn’t
mention Michael Giacchino’s appropriately bombastic score, which elevates so
many key moments of the film, including the opening title, to the kind of
heart-pounding experience that makes you want to jump out of your seat and
cheer.</p>

<p>J.J. Abrams is known for his compelling mystery work (you can read what he
thinks on the subject <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-05/mf_jjessay">here
</a>and listen to
his thoughts
<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/j_j_abrams_mystery_box.html">here</a>). In
the past decade he has captivated a nation with his multiple twisted
television series, but this is only his second feature as director. How
appropriate then, that one of our most prolific television writers helm a
cinematic adaptation of one of our most beloved skeins. Infamously approaching
the project as a non-Trekkie, Mr. Abrams cut through the fandom and lore in an
effort to find the human (and Vulcan…you know what I mean) story at the
core. This year’s <em>Star Trek</em> holds its own not only against the rest of the
franchise but against all other competitions. I find it hard to believe that
you have more fun at any other movie this summer, but it’s only mid-May.
Here’s to a great start to summer 2009.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has not gone unnoticed that Disney princesses have shared a skin tone for
about 5 decades: white. There are exceptions to this rule, such as Jasmine and
Pocahantas. Still, the animators at the Mouse House are looking to fill a
noticeable gap in their royal equality this winter with <em>The Princess and the
Frog</em>, the first film to feature a black princess.</p>

<p>There isn’t much to say as all we have to go on so far is this teaser trailer
released yesterday. The internet is already aflame with arguments over the
white prince. “Why no strong black man?” the internet is asking. Well, I’ll
reserve judgement for the actual film. In the meantime, let’s take a look at
this trailer.</p>

<p>Otherwise ho-hum, this preview really banks on the whole “first black
princess” thing. After a quick restrospective of Disney’s most beloved (read:
boffo) 2-dimensional films, an outline of the newest princess, Tiana, is drawn
onto a blank parchment and then POW! fills in with color. While the presence
of an African-American princess is groundbreaking in the Disney canon, I’m
personally more excited to see an animated New Orleans French Quarter. I’m not
positive, but this may be the most modern princess story Disney has attempted,
set in America no less. Watch the trailer below and leave your thoughts in the
comments.</p>

Fake IMAX Screens”]<img src="http://www.lfexaminer.com/screencompa.JPG" alt="Comparrison of Real vs. Fake IMAX
Screens" />[/caption]</p>

<p>Funnyman Aziz Ansari, currently gaining some traction through his role as Tom
Haverford on NBC’s <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, went on a little bit of a rampage
yesterday about IMAX technology after seeing <em>Star Trek</em> on a sub-par screen
that was billed as The IMAX Experience. His language is a bit colorful on the
matter, but you should <a href="http://azizisbored.tumblr.com/post/106587114/reblog-the-fuck-out-of-
this-warning-amc-theaters-are">definitely check it out over at his site, Aziz is
Bored</a>.</p>

<p>The short of it is that we are in the very early years of IMAX as a feature
length distribution method, and there are bound to be some hiccups along the
way. Once the centerpiece of many a science museum, the massive screens and
65mm projectors have since been adapted for longer spools of film and thus
year-round mainstream use. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some faltering along
the way. Worse, I know for a fact that most viewers won’t care either way.</p>

<p>I plan to do some research on the subject shortly, but in the meantime you can
check out Aziz’s <a href="http://azizisbored.tumblr.com/post/106910193/aziz-
vs-imax-round-2-imax-ceo-responds-and-so-do-i">update </a>on his blog in which he
challenges the CEO of IMAX, Richard Gelfond, to a debate. I do hope that
happens, as we at the candler blog believe that distribution methods should be
discussed openly. For a list of IMAX theaters and specific details near you,

<h3 id="my-review">My review</h3>

<p>](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/53805874) rating: 4 of 5 stars This
book it tough to swallow as it humanizes one of the most vile people in
history, Adolf Hitler. However, once I allowed myself to get into the book, I
saw the genius behind Mailer’s work. If we humanize a man by seeing him
through the eyes of a devil, what does that say about us? Layers and questions
fill this book, making it more of a stimulating read than an informational
one. Also, Mailer’s prose is incredible here. He is like a chameleon, entering
an older dialect for an older tale. I knew he was great, just didn’t realize
he was so diverse. A master of letters! (exclamation points add to the book’s
charm. check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Drugs, guns, vulgarity and rims are just the tip of the pigeonholed iceberg
that is Benny Boom’s feature debut, <em>Next Day Air</em>; but what this little caper
has that so many other films of a similar ilk lack is heart, and lots of it.</p>

<p>The improbable story follows ten bricks of cocaine from a formidable drug
dealer in Calexico, California to his dispatcher in Philadelphia by way of an
overnight delivery service, Next Day Air. Donald Faison, of <em>Scrubs</em> fame,
plays Leo Jackson, a chronically stoned delivery man for the fictitious
company, whose mind is so clouded on the job that he delivers the coke to
apartment 302 instead of 303, setting events in motion. The drugs end up in
the hands of fledgling criminals Guch, Brody and Hassie instead of the
diminutive yet feisty Jesus, who prefers to be called “Gee-sus” rather than
“Hay-zoos”. While Hassie is sleeping on the couch, as he is for the most of
the film, Guch and Brody, played with an incredible balance of humor and
charisma by Wood Harris and Mike Epps, respectively, hatch a plan to sell the
dope to Brody’s cousin, Shavoo, before the rightful owners get wise to the
mistake. Think of it like <em>True Romance</em> but without white people and set in
Philly.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Faison, whose comedic talents are on display in full force, opens
the film with a quick line of dialogue, the story doesn’t really belong to
him. Instead, Guch and Brody are really at the center of this tall tale. True,
they are hardened criminals with blood on their hands (blood from a gruesome
yet hilarious flashback, that is) living in an apartment full of blingy
contraband with guns in every corner. Still, they are some kind of lovable
fools; boys really, who somehow landed in a playground of vices instead
growing up. Just watching the two play Xbox, yelling and hissing at the plasma
TV, is evidence enough of their terminal adolescence.</p>

<p>In contrast is Brody’s cousin, Shavoo, the local drug dealer who can “turn ten
into twenty” by way of compressing and cutting the dastardly white powder. He
is, decidedly, a swindler, yet we also learn he is a dreamer, wishing of a way
out of his dirty business. After receiving a laughable call from his coz with
details on the new found blow (“bitches”), Shavoo sees a way out by buying the
coke, turning more than double the profit, and leaving the game forever.</p>

<p><em>Next Day Air</em> plays heavy on the laughs, with each specific sub-plot full of
goofy moments, a welcome to change to the shoot ‘em up street tale drama. Mos
Def appears briefly for added comic relief, but this isn’t just a comedy.
There is grit in almost every frame of this movie. The film’s palette is
something of a washed out yellow with a milky blue in the blacks. This is a
sign of aged film, perhaps short ends from various rolls, implying a shoe-
string budget and a make-it-as-you-can shooting schedule. Assumedly, this
invokes the blaxploitation cinema that this film aims to build upon. Unlike
those films from the 1970s, however, there isn’t really any presence of “the
man”, though threat of “the Feds” is mentioned in passing. Where others may
call this a revival of the blaxploitation movement, I would say the film’s
roots lie closer to Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Resevoir Dogs</em>, an open and shut
heist where the evil-doers also serve as judge, jury and executioner.</p>

<p>It must be said that the film is full of a number of harsh stereotypes, the
kind of stuff that many black filmmakers in Hollywood have been trying to
shake for a long time. African-American film is one of the fastest growing
genres in the country and much of that movement is a deviation from the kind
of street thuggery portrayed in <em>Next Day Air</em>. The real charm of Benny Boom’s
film, however, is it’s ability to question this base amoral lifestyle while
keeping you laughing. Mr. Boom shows real promise as a critical filmmaker.
Much in the way that David Fincher’s 1999 <em>Fight Club</em> served as a critique of
masculity while celerating it’s basest functions, so to does <em>Next Day Air</em>
seemingly glorify thug culture while refuting it’s relevance. I won’t give
away the end of the film, but I will say the right people get their
comeuppance. Personally, I cannot wait to see where Mr. Boom goes from here,
but it will certainly be up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.pjlighthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10

huge-jackman.jpg" alt="" /></a>Sitting down to consider an entire series
of X-Men (X-People?) Origins films, I am reminded of Chaucer, the Middle
English scribe whose death kept him from completing nearly 100 promised
stories in <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>. With any luck, I’ll be long dead before
anyone tries to make another installment in this franchise with the same
foolhardy bravado that director Gavin Hood and his team have brought to <em>X-Men
Origins: Wolverine</em>.</p>

<p>The film opens with a hint of promise in northwestern Canada in 1845. A sickly
young James Logan, who is to become our Wolverine, accidentally kills his
biological father (who had just killed his adopted father!) with his newly
discovered retractable bone claws and runs off to the woods. There, another
boy, Victor, who we just learned is in fact James’s brother, is waiting. They
run off together, promising never to separate and to never go back.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Victor is a mutant just like James. He will grow up to become
who X-heads will recognize as Sabretooth, though filmgoers will never know
that as he is never bestowed a fabulous nom de guerre as our hunky Logan is
(Wolverine, rawr). Since their main power is the ability to cheat death, they
live on through history, though oddly, United States history. For whatever
reason, these two mutant Canucks fight in every major U.S. war of the last two
centuries. This confusion is compounded by the question: if they are immortal,
why did they choose to stay thirty-five forever? Normally I might gloss over
these niggles, but this is an origin story after all; these are the questions
we need answers to.</p>

<p>Their extreme abilities are noticed by a William Stryker, who invites them to
an elite unit of mutant soldiers. On a special ops mission in “Africa”
(geeeeezus can’t you be more specific?), Logan backs down when things get too
ugly, what with the killing and torture of civilians and all. This pits him
against his bloodthirsty brother, setting off a thin plotline which doesn’t
warrant much explanation. From the get go, our feisty protag believes in the
powers of good. This, among all the other noise and confusion, is the real
problem with this film.</p>

<p>Origin stories are as old as oral storytelling and they have remianed
consistenly unchanged. Ultimately, an origin relies not on the acquisition of
power or skill, but rather on the choosing to work toward either good or evil.
Off the bat, Logan is a good guy, stopping his megalomaniac brother from
succumbing to evil within the first fifteen minutes of the film. Why is he so
righteous? This is the one question we needed answered but were denied.</p>

<p>To switch off the cerebral deconstruction of the film, I should mention that
the action scenes are wholly unappealing. For one, the effects look
ludicrously fake, particularly a heavy reliance on green-screened backgrounds.
This is the stuff of made for TV movies and it’s insulting to think that
audience’s would stand for it. This film is a surefire hit considering the
X-Men branding, why not throw a bit of cash into some actual locations?</p>

<p>As for Mr. Hood, whose <em>Tsosti</em> won best foreign language film at the 2006
Oscars, I don’t know that blame for this schlocky film should rest entirely on
his shoulders. He is not the first independant director thrust into the fold
of a messy studio blockbuster which nearly swallows him whole. Antoine Fuqua
(whose <em>Training Day</em> nabbed Denzel Washington his first best actor Oscar) is
another filmmaker who was nearly shuffled into obscurity after his disastrous
2004 actioner, <em>King Arthur</em>.</p>

<p>Ever since the success of <em>Spiderman</em>, with niche horror director Sam Raimi at
the helm, Hollywood has been seeking out fringe directors for their biggest
projects. In many cases, such as in the choice of Alfonso Cuarón (a foreign
film oscar nominee) to direct <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>,
which resulted in, at least in this critic’s opinion, the most beautiful and
moving pic in the franchise. Mr. Hood did not prove as adept at honing his
skills for a film of this size. This film is clunky at best, cheesy at worst.
It feels almost as if no one is driving this caravan, which is where Gavin
Hood, who may one day become a great director, has failed us.</p>

<p>As I’m sure you know, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was illegally distributed on
the internet a month ago. The cause of that leak is still unknown, at least
publicly, but it fits in line with the overall problem with this film: no one
is home at the top. The story lumbers along with very little holding it
together. Perhaps the leak was an accident, committed by one of the many
people involved on this film who were obviously looking the other way as it
completely fell apart.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Today, the candler blog is proud to introduce a new column, Candle Whacks. The purpose of these essays will be to entertain as well as gain a little perspective on current views of media. We hope you enjoy this first installment and would love to hear any ideas you may have future Candle Whacks. Guest contributors are always welcome, just pitch an idea.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/biphone.png" title="My B Heavy iPhone" /></p>

<p>Beastie Boys. Beatles. Beck. Ben Folds. Björk. Blur. Bob Dylan. Bob Marley.</p>

<p>Artists whose name begins with the letter “B” represent nearly a quarter of the music loaded on my iPod, which holds a mere sixteen gigabytes of music as it is stuffed inside of my telephone. If Robert Leland’s <em>Cryptographical Mathematics</em> is to be trusted, B is merely the 19th most popular letter in the English language. While the king of them all, appearing in over 12% of all words, “E”, takes up less than 3% of my trusted music player. Second place “T” is even less, just 19 songs. Even the popular “R” is only about a tenth of my mobile collection.</p>

<p>There is no science to this whatsoever. Letter frequency is measured across words, not just the first letter of names. Still, are my tastes actually geared specifically to the letter B? Am I attracted to its curves; the way it takes two sensuous strokes to form the left-most vertical line and its intersecting bulbs? Perhaps, but I neither speak nor write in a particularly “B” heavy manner. “ Bravo, bitches. Best bargain bins in Binghamton.” I might say. “ Ban burger barns and bawdy balers in the bible belt.” I might protest.</p>

<p>Not so.</p>

<p>The answer is much less interesting then any leftist lexical leaning or lustful letter love interest. I’m just lazy. As the owner of a sensible 45 gigabytes of digital music (B represents 16% of my total library) I have been forced to pare down my collection in order to fit them onto my iPhone.</p>

<p>Initially, I was committed to being even handed with all of my music. If I could not have it all with me all the time, at least I could have a decent cross-section. Jazz, Rock, Pop, Instrumentals, Hip Hop, maybe a smattering of movie scores; they would all make it onto my phone in equal proportions.</p>

<p>Genre tagging has never been my forte, so music is always organized alphabetically, by artist and then by album. So it is a proverbial scalpel that I must take to my music in order to gerrymander it onto my device with care and exactitude. Perform a RollingStones-ectomy over here, while removing a malignant TomWaits-tumor over there. Precision is vital in the process.</p>

<p>This is how it works in my dreams. Give the alphabetic nature of my collection, instead I just wander down the list from A to Z, slowly gathering the music I need most. The first time I did this, I hit sixteen gigs by about F. Cat Stevens and Chicago were simply taking up too much space. So I nixed some songs and trudged on. Not enough room for all of my Kinks albums. I could live with only half of my Miles Davis, but must I compromise on my albums by The Roots? By the time I made it all the way down to The Zombies, I had been put through hell, killing off my my favorite babies left and right.</p>

<p>However, the B’s, thanks in part to those artists listed above, remain unscathed. They get to stay because they planted a flag first. My eldest children offered the birthright of stagnancy. For as long as I have had an iPhone (I have gone through seven of them, don’t ask), the B’s have always been there, taking up the the bulk of my NAND flash memory.</p>

<p>I can’t help but think this is a sign of things to come. Last summer, I slowly began digitizing my DVD collection, mostly for viewing on my iPhone. We know that eventually, there will be enough storage on our mobile devices to accommodate whole film collections. Perhaps they will one day supplant music as the dominant media type on these devices.</p>

<p>When that happens, will I run into the same problem? <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Batman and Beauty and the Beast</em> will be my films of choice. Will I wander the streets of Manhattan wearing video goggles, quoting <em>The Big Sleep</em> or <em>Black Narcissus</em>. “One point twenty-one gigawatts!” I might proffer a tourist waiting for a light to change in Times Square, who in turn will go home with a negative view of her trip east.</p>

<p>Or perhaps Bergman, Burton and Beatty will be the heavy hitters. “One of us, one of us.” I imagine I may chant this while standing at a urinal at Citi Field, taking in some of Tod Browning’s <em>Freaks</em> during a quick seventh inning pee, my next-piss neighbor thankful for the splash guard blocking his view.</p>

<p>Of course, I can’t honestly predict the future. For now, I will have to live with my B heavy music. “Venus as a Boy” will follow a listening of “Shake your Rump”. “One Down” and “Three Little Birds” will be next.</p>

<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when I would choose my media based on taste or mood.</p>

<p>Not anymore. Until I get this mess figured out, alphabetical frequency and name popularity will determine my listening patterns. I’m okay with that.</p>

<p>Now leave me be, I’ve must listen to <em>Revolver</em> again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The proliferation of documentary cinema over the past decade has given us a
nice sized stack of memorable, moving, earth shattering, awareness raising and
thought provoking films. With that has come a steaming heap of boring,
schmaltzy, formulaic and fetishistic pieces that betray audiences, subjects
and filmmakers equally. _Anvil! The Story of Anvil _isn’t quite the latter,
but it certainly steers closer to that end of the spectrum. That being said,
as far as docs go these days, it’s a pretty good movie.</p>

<p>Opening like an episode of VH1’s Behind the Music, the film chronicles the ups
and downs (mostly downs) of heavy metal rockers Robb Reiner and Steve “Lips”
Kudlow, whose promising rise in the early 1980s (playing in Tokyo alongside,
Poison and Whitesnake, for example) never materialized into the mega careers
of their dreams. No matter. Now into their 50s, the band is still together.
Both Robb and Steve sport day-jobs while Anvil trudges on, playing local bars
and parties with a small following of faithful fans.</p>

<p>Like many documentarians, Sacha Gervasi, the film’s director, embeds himself
with the once and future rock stars through some wild ups and downs. After
profiling the Toronto based group, specifically Mr. Reiner and Mr. Kudlow, he
story moves to a European tour where pretty much everything and anything goes
wrong. Venues withholding payment, missing buses and trains, audiences of less
than a dozen people; it’s all here. And of course, the two founding members,
who have been rocking together nearly four decades, get into spats with each
other en route.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that there are more downs in this tale. Instead of following
a steady sine curve of emotional fracas, Mr. Gervasi instead takes the low
road to beat a reaction out of us. The camera often exacerbates uncomfortable
situations, painting both front-men as negative caricatures of themselves.
“Lips” plays as something of a jester while Mr. Reiner comes off like, for
lack of a better word, an ass hole. Truly, these men must be more complex than
this.</p>

<p>There is a great story here, but instead we are fed the same manipulative crap
that seems to be coming from every “reality” based angle. After the failure of
the tour in Europe, “Lips” sends a demo to the first producer they worked with
early in their career, Chris Tsangarides, who in  turn opts to produce the
band’s thirteenth album. Enter requisite in-studio bickering.</p>

<p>Look, I realize that this is the reality of this band. Mr. Gervasi didn’t make
any of these events up. I just believe that there is a better way to get to
the core of a story than to expose your subject’s dirty laundry. Sure, the
film offers up plenty of happy moments and, as advertised is something of a
testament to the human spirit, but only as much as William Hung was in 2004.</p>

<p>Documentary films are not supposed to be this simple. In someone else’s hands,
perhaps the real story of Anvil would be more compelling, more truthful, and
aim towards greater understanding of something, anything. That doesn’t mean it
isn’t wholly watchable. There are some fun scenes scattered throughout. When
this shows up on the IFC channel one day it’d be a fun watch. For now, not
worth a trip to the theater.</p>
