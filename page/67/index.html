  <div class="entry-content"><p>Screenwriter Sean Hood on Quora, answering the question “What’s it like to have your film flop at the box office? Don’t they know how bad it is before it comes out?”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the work I do as a script doctor is hard to defend if the movie flops. I know that those who have read my Conan shooting script agree that much of the work I did on story and character never made it to screen. I myself know that given the difficulties of rewriting a script in the middle of production, I made vast improvements on the draft that came before me. But its still much like doing great work on a losing campaign. All anyone in the general public knows, all anyone in the industry remembers, is the flop. A loss is a loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a long answer to a complicated question, but every word is worth reading. Hollywood is very good at ruining solid scripts, but the real value in Hood’s answer comes at the end, when he talks about what his next move is. Just great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two years ago, when it was announced that Ridley Scott would be directing an
<em>Alien</em> prequel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I posted a piece here titled <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/07/31/ridley-scott-to-
return-to-alien-big-whoop/">Ridley Scott to Return to
Alien, Big Whoop</a>. In light of this week’s news that he is now
signed on to <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/ridley-scott-ready-to-direct-new-
version-of-seminal-sci-fi-film-blade-runner/">direct a new <em>Blade Runner</em>
film</a> I figured it was worth
revisiting that post. Here’s the key paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point here is that the logic behind bringing him back to the film may be
exciting because of who he is now, but I am not interested in the fact that he
started this whole thing so long ago. Perhaps bringing a fresh face to the
series would create an even better film. To wit, would anyone have preferred
Leonard Nimoy or Nicholas Meyer to have directed this summer’s <em>Star Trek</em>?
Even better, couldn’t the last three <em>Star Wars</em> films have been enhanced by a
director other than George Lucas in the same manner that Irvin Kershner
brought a fresh eye to <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>? I’m not saying these rules
always hold true. For example, look where Richard Lester and Sidney J. Furie
took Richard Donner’s <em>Superman: The Movie</em> (the dumps, we can fight about it
in another post if you like). On the other hand, could anyone imagine Mr.
Donner stepping back in to that series in 2006? The guy who made <em>16 Blocks</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I may as well say that about this new announcement. Our current obsession with
nostalgia is good for these old properties but it’s odd that we consider an
aged director part of the authenticity of a piece. I should add Francis Ford
Coppola to this list. His newest films have been a revelation, but <em>The
Godfather: Part III</em> showed that he clearly wasn’t that director any more.</p>

<p>I’m excited to see Scott’s <em>Prometheus</em> and can only hope that as the idea of
a new <em>Blade Runner</em> gestates it will morph into something else. Does the
world need another reboot?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Michelle Clancy for Rapid TV News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “Living Rooms” report reveals that although Internet-connected devices in the living room have proliferated to over half of U.S. consumers, they remain underutilised for TV and movie entertainment. For example, according to Interpret’s New Media Measure syndicated study, only 22% of those who own a gaming console connected to the Internet have used it to stream a movie or TV show, and among owners of set-top boxes such as Apple TV or Roku, that number is even lower (18%).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait a second, only 18% of AppleTV and Roku owners actually use them for streaming? What are the other 82% doing with them? Something’s missing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Stu Maschwitz’s <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2011/8/9/screenplay-markdown.html">readers pointed out</a>, there are a few options available currently that allow for screenplay formatting in a plain text document similar to his <a href="http://prolost.com/storage/downloads/spmd/SPMD_proposal.html">Screenplay Markdown proposal</a>. One of these is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/screenbundle/">Screenbundle</a>, a TextMate add-on that formats text documents for screenwriting. Stu, however, expresses reservations about this kind of a solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All seem to behave like Final Draft in interpreting plain text into a screenplay format. Which is nice, but it’s a one-way street. I’m thinking there might be a place for a plaintext screenplay format with markdown-like syntax, and a WYSIWYG desktop app that works with that format as easily as FDX.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ask me, Screenbundle loaded into TextMate isn’t as much of a one way street as Stu lets on. I’d like to do a quick primer on it and show you why I think it’s a great solution that you can dive into right now.</p>

<h2 id="get-your-geek-on">Get Your Geek On</h2>

<p>Pick up your thick-rimmed goggles and leave your Neo-Luddism at the door, it’s time to do some nerdy work. First off, we need to get TextMate and Screenbundle up and running smoothly enough for a non-programmer to enjoy it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download and install <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>.</li>
  <li>Download the newest version of Screenbundle <a href="http://code.google.com/p/screenbundle/downloads/detail?name=screenbundle-314.zip">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Unzip the file, which will reveal “Screenwriting.tmbundle”.</li>
  <li>Double click Screenwriting.tmbundle</li>
  <li>TextMate will launch or activate and Screenbundle will be installed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that was easy. So what’s a bundle?</p>

<p>In TextMate, bundles are basically sets of rules that apply to specific document types. For example, the HTML bundle features code snippets, syntax highlighting rules and preview windows previews that apply only to HTML documents. You can find all of the installed bundles, including your newly minted copy of Screenbundle, under the Bundles menu. Screenbundle appears there as “Screenwriting”.</p>

<h2 id="just-start">Just Start</h2>

<p>Now that we have everything set up, let’s start a script. Open a new, blank TextMate document. By default, new documents are plain text, but we want to change the language of the document. To do this, simply look to the bottom of your window and find the drop-down menu that has an L (for language!) and the words Plain Text.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tm-bottom-shadow.png" alt="TextMate Bottom Bar" /></p>

<p>Click it, and up will come all of your languages options. Select “Screenplay”. Nothing should change in the document; what you’ve done is told TextMate to recognize screenwriting syntax. From there, you can start to do write a screenplay like you’re probably already used to.</p>

<p>Your first line is going to be a slugline, or a scene heading. “int. house - night” should be good enough. Hit return and voila, the line flips to all caps and changes color. Next up is action text, which you type like normal paragraphs. Hitting tab on a new line after action or slug moves the cursor 4 tab spaces over for your character line. Hit return again and you’re set for dialogue, which is 2 tabs. Ending a scene is equally simple, just type “cut to:” or “fade to:” on a new line and hit return. That line will be moved across the screen and TextMate will be ready for a new scene.</p>

<p>Some of the niceties of Final Draft and other apps are still present. Screenbundle is able to remember characters and locations. Start up a conversation between two characters and it can auto-fill names back and forth. Every scene you write will now be listed in a drop-down on the bottom bar of your TextMate window. Click on a scene’s slugline and your cursor will jump to it in the document. All of this is happening in a plain text document with no markup.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="on-the-road">On the Road</h2>

<p>One of the most valuable bits of Screenbundle’s documentation is its explanation of what’s going on behind the scenes. To me, this is reminiscent of learning how to bang out a screenplay on a typewriter[^2]; useful in a pinch and fun to keep in the memory banks. For screenbundle, it’s all about the tab key. I’ll shorten the basic syntax:</p>

<p>Any text editor on any platform with a tab key can now work in this screenplay format. I’m a fan of iOS, where there are many (many, many) text editing options. My preferred text editor of late is <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/02/daedalus-touch-brings-beautiful-text-editing-to-the-ipad/">Daedalus Touch</a>, which luckily just added a tab key to its extended keyboard. Other options are WriteRoom and Nebulous Notes. I recommend beginning your scripts in TextMate first, at least when out with Screenbundle. That way you’ll have at least a visual reference as to where your tabs should land.</p>

<p>My preferred iOS text editor of late is <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/02/daedalus-touch-brings-beautiful-text-editing-to-the-ipad/">Daedalus Touch</a>, which luckily just added a tab key to its extended keyboard. Other options are WriteRoom and Nebulous Notes. I recommend beginning your scripts in TextMate first, at least when out with Screenbundle. That way you’ll have at least a visual reference as to where your tabs should land.</p>

<p>Screenbundle’s documentation includes a guide to using the tab key on your text documents. Here’s what it basically comes down to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slugline: Begins with “INT.”, “EXT.”, “I/E.” OR consists of all capitol letters.</li>
  <li>Action: Any line that doesn’t start with a tab and is not a Slugline or Left-Transition.</li>
  <li>Characters: 4 tabs.</li>
  <li>Parenthetical: 3 tabs and begins &amp; ends with parenthesis.</li>
  <li>Dialogue: 2 tabs.</li>
  <li>Transitions: 10 tabs. This isn’t as fast as typing straight into TextMate, but it’s a start.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="output-and-delivery">Output and Delivery</h2>

<p>Eventually, you’re going to have to get your screenplay to look like a standard screenplay. From within TextMate you can load a very good looking screenplay preview. Here’s a screen grab of the first page of <em>The Social Network</em> in a TextMate with a preview window loaded next to it. Click them for a closer look.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/social-network-grab-shadow.png"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/social-network-grab-shadow-246x300.png" alt="Screenbundle Social Network" /></a><a href="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/social-network-preview-grab-shadow.png"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/social-network-preview-grab-shadow-246x300.png" alt="Screenbundle Social Network Preview" /></a></p>

<p>This forces you to treat writing and proof-reading as two separate tasks. Final Draft and other applications adhere to the page paradigm (which <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/08/16/i-hope-screenplay-markdown-kills-the-page-paradigm/">I’m not so fond of</a>) by keeping you aware of the current page the whole time. You are working on something that looks like a finished product. The creative process is a bit kludgier than that. Sometimes it helps to make a mess.</p>

<p>Luckily, if you do want to know what page you are on, Screenbundle has a handy counter that will tell you the current page based on where you are in your document. I like that you can check the current page instead of being made aware of it constantly by the application.</p>

<p>The best way to get your script ready for delivery, in my opinion, is to bring it into Final Draft, which can open .txt files and convert them to script formatting. Screenbundle allows you to send the current script in Final Draft, but only to Final Draft 7. There is a way to modify the code to allow it to open in Final Draft 8, but the easiest method is to simply save the script as a .txt file and open it in FD.</p>

<p>The other option is to make a PDF straight out of TextMate, which is only sort of possible. To do this you’ll need an install of <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a>. The bad problem is that not only is Prince a somewhat advanced install, but the free version of it puts a watermark in the corner of every page. To remove it, you need to purchase a Prince license, which is $500, not even close to feasible.</p>

<h2 id="versus">Versus</h2>

<p>You might be asking at this point “Why would I use Screenbundle instead of Final Draft?” The real answer is that in order to have a complete screenplay workflow, you’re going to need a copy of Final Draft, no matter what application you want to write in. Unfortunately, it’s still an industry standard, so if you’re passing scripts around, you can’t go without it. Besides, Final Draft is a killer editing and organization application. For writing, it’s not always the best choice.</p>

<p>That’s where Screenbundle comes in. It makes the process of creating new work that much simpler by making it usable on more devices. Plus, part of the fun of TextMate is that you can tweak it to your hearts content. You can change the colors of text highlights, pick whatever font you like<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and do about a million other geeky things<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It sounds like things are advancing on Screenplay Markdown, but until someone implements the new syntax in an actual application, Screenbundle provides a great plain text script writing experience that is available now.</p>

has received, you can tell he has struck a nerve. He certainly has with me.</p>

<p>probably be lost.</p>

<p>From the proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screenplay Markdown, or SPMD, is a proposal for a simple markup syntax that
would allow early drafts of screenplays to be edited in plain, human-readable
text. SPMD allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer,
using any software that edits text files.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By keeping the file as plain text, it becomes eminently mobile, able to be
opened on virtually any device with a screen, be it a smartphone, tablet or
computer, without any loss in quality. That would be a very cool thing.</p>

<p>The truth is that screenplay formatting itself hasn’t aged well. It has one
saving grace, that each page represents approximately one minute of screen
time, but even that shouldn’t mean all that much to a screenwriter. That’s the
stuff of “the biz,” the kinds of things a producer should worry about, not a
writer. Aaron Sorkin’s script for <em>The Social Network</em> weighs in at over 160
pages, yet the completed film’s length is two hours. Do you think he was
looking in the corner of his copy of Final Draft, sweating his page count?</p>

<p>When I was in high school, my introduction to screenwriting came from the book
<a href="http://lewhunter.com/">Lew Hunter’s Screenwriting 434</a>, a great entrée for a budding mind. Alas,
we all grow up and, well, our elders sound like windbags:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The staggering majority of quality scripts land Act One, the situation,
either side of [page] 17….The audience doesn’t want to wait to, say, page 30
to find out what they’re watching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then to math:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three into seventeen is almost six. Approximately six scenes at an average
of three pages each for Act One.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s not wrong. Lew Hunter is teaching a craft, preparing people with a
marketable skill like one would prepare a plumber or a mechanic. No one can
start to think out of the box unless they understand that it exists.
Conventions are important, but they are not everything. What Hunter’s and
others’ equally shrewd systems have done is make pagination gospel, make it
part of of the process. And so screenwriting applications rely on the page
paradigm, constantly reminding you where you are in your progress. The
creative process is more interesting than that.</p>

<p>The problem with screenwriting books, courses and professors (especially
professors) is that they all tend to produce similar results, which is to say
utterly similar films. This is a gross generalization, but we’ve all seen tons
of films, piles and piles of them, that feel workshopped to death and far too
reliant these kinds of conventions. You can’t look for where your page 17 is
if your working on pages that don’t have numbers. Which means to leap to
Screenplay Markdown, writers will have to leave behind the concept of a
“page.” Thank fucking goodness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tim Adler for Deadline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rioters broke in to the Sony DADC Distribution Centre on Monday night and set it ablaze. The studio, which handles physical DVD distribution for indie UK distributors and record companies, says that 25 million discs have been lost in the arson attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may seem a trivial thing to worry about DVDs as England is set ablaze, but this warehouse housed the entire stock for a number of indie distributors. Sony was insured and is putting contingencies into place, but there will be short term shortages for these companies who rely on DVD sales for their business. What did indie film companies ever do to the rioters?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The filmmaker and writer Nelson George has a new piece in the New York Times
called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/movies/black-and-white-struggle-
through-hollywoods-rosy-glow.html">“Black-and-White Struggle With a Rosy
Glow”</a>. It is a short but sprawling report on the
flimsy handling of the American civil rights movement in Hollywood films. He
uses this week’s release of Tate Taylor’s <em>The Help</em> as an entry point to the
pitfalls of American cinema regarding our nation’s incredible struggle with
racism. He doesn’t introduce anything particularly new, but rather lays out
what has been abundantly clear regarding how cinema tends to handle the
tumultuous decades of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fail-safe response for Hollywood has been to depict racial prejudice in
cartoon caricature, a technique that has made the Southern redneck a cinematic
bad guy on par with Nazis, Arab terrorists and zombies. By denying the casual,
commonplace quality of racial prejudice, and peering into the saddest values
of the greatest generation, Hollywood perpetuates an ahistorical vision of how
democracy and white supremacy comfortably co-existed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph feels of monumental importance in the wake of the recent
<a href="http://hypertext.net/2011/08/hate-crime-
videotaped">murder of James Craig Anderson</a> by a group of white teenagers led by 18-year-old Deryl Dedmon, Jr.
in Jackson, Mississippi. Hollywood’s rednecks may be some kind of foreign
evil, but in reality, they’re our friends and neighbors. Worse, they’re our
kids.</p>

<p>One of the things that I find most harrowing about this horrific crime is
Dedmon’s mugshot. He is a scrawny, bright-eyed boy, yet he is the face of
hatred; he is the face of racism. Deryl Dedmon, Jr. is a murderer who killed a
black man because he thought it would be fun. George’s point is that in films
we don’t see the commonplace racism that leads to horrific acts such as
Anderson’s murder. Hollywood’s stories need a villain, but what about when
that villain is the kid next door?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do the filmmakers put us inside the head of the black woman braving a
gantlet of jeering whites to integrate a segregated school? Do we understand
the strain on a white diner owner who finally allows blacks to enter his place
despite the anger of his neighbors? It is this nuanced humanity that this
movement demands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel Melvin Van Peebles’s 1970 <em>Watermelon Man</em> is worth mentioning here.
The film is about Jeff Gerber (played by comedian Godfrey Cambridge), a
loudmouth suburban white racist who wakes up one day as a black man. His
friends, family and neighbors who were once the prim and pious quiet ones in
the face of his boisterous racism, now show their true colors toward Gerber’s
new form. Once it is clear that there is nothing that could make Gerber white
again, his relationships and his status erode to the point that he is no
longer welcome in the community. The film ends on a sobering note, with Gerber
and other black men preparing to fight, as if for battle. The war, it seems,
was only beginning.</p>

<p>Peebles would go on to make the groundbreaking <em>Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss
Song</em>. That film represents a turning point in black cinema, but <em>Watermelon
Man</em> is a standout work in its own right. It portrays what Nelson George is
suggesting, rightly, is too often forgotten in civil rights cinema, showing us
not just the violent ugliness of racism but its underlying prevalence. The
violent history of racism in this country is something we should never
undermine. Still, there is a certain horror in watching Jeff Gerber’s
neighbors cogently explain why he must move out for fear of their property
values dropping. This was not the extreme, this was market-supported racism
that illustrated just how deeply entrenched our nation was.</p>

<p>If George’s Times piece gets you fired up to seek out films about the civil
rights movement, I think <em>Watermelon Man</em> should be on your shortlist. Follow
it up with a screening of <em>Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song</em> and you’ll
already be two films deep into Peebles’s repertoire. Not a bad start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Julie Bosman for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/books
/survey-shows-publishing-expanded-since-2008.html">New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BookStats, a comprehensive survey conducted by two major trade groups that
was released early Tuesday, revealed that in 2010 publishers generated net
revenue of $27.9 billion, a 5.6 percent increase over 2008. Publishers sold
2.57 billion books in all formats in 2010, a 4.1 percent increase since 2008.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn’t have data for 2009?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ms. Raccah emphasized that the newest survey incorporates data from a much
larger group of publishers, in addition to distributors, wholesalers and
retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble. In its definition of what is a book, the report
counted professional and scholarly journals and databases, multimedia teaching
materials and mobile apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of the numbers here are somewhat dubious. The survey took all of the
apples and oranges (and pears and lemons and, hell, some avocados) and lumped
them together to show a net win. For one, I’m not sure what growth over two
years tells you.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The numbers that are of personal interest to me, and perhaps to most outside
of the publishing industry, are these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2008 e-books were 0.6 percent of the total trade market; in 2010, they
were 6.4 percent. Publishers have seen especially robust e-book sales in genre
fiction like romance, mystery and thrillers, as well as literary fiction. In
2010, 114 million e-books were sold, the report said. &gt; &gt; The survey does not
include sales data from 2011, a year of substantial e-book growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…sales of adult hardcover and paperback books from 2008 through 2010 were
relatively flat, growing about 1 percent over three years. Sales of mass-
market paperbacks declined 16 percent since 2008.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, paper-bound books are dying fast, but e-books are being rapidly
adopted to pick up the slack. I’ve been reading nearly everything
electronically for at least two years<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and I don’t miss paper nearly as
much as I thought I would. There are some aspects of paper that e-books can’t
replicate, just ask <a href="http://www.visual-editions.com/our-
books/book/tree-of-codes">Jonathan Safran Foer</a>, but that doesn’t mean that e-books can’t replace
most books.</p>

<p>Publishing’s dirty secret is that the kinds of books that people think of as
great writing, the groundbreaking fiction and non-fiction that fill the
shelves of your local book store, represent only the tiniest portion of a $28
billion pie. Professional and academic publishing deals keep the industry
afloat. Think of all the money squandered on books at colleges. That’s what
keeps books in print for now.</p>

<p>I don’t particularly see why consumers might be scared of moving forward into
the e-book age. The cost of entry is low enough, and even when the prices are
comparable to that of a physical book, the convenience that e-readers offer is
still great. I don’t see why paper books can’t live a long and happy life
alongside vinyl records, which are still produced by the artists who care for
the format and sought out by listeners who prefer it.</p>

<p>The publishing industry is finally realizing what the music industry did long
ago, that the convenience and quality that digital offers is something
consumers not only want, but need. The time to treat digital as an
afterthought has passed.</p>

<p>PDF](http://www.bisg.org/docs/BookStats_BEA2011_final_presentation.pdf) is the
best they could do?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ben Fritz for the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/08
/consumers-now-spending-more-renting-movies-than-buying-them.html">L.A.
Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New data released Friday by the Digital Entertainment Group, an industry
trade association, showed that people spent $4.2 billion renting movies in the
first six months of 2011, compared with $4.1 billion buying them on disc or
via digital download.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the data cited in the article shows that people are more likely to
subscribe to services like Netflix than they are to purchase a physical disc
or a digital download. Sneaked in at the end of the article, however, is this
tidbit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Total spending on Blu-ray increased 10% in the first half of this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, in the DEG’s report (<a href="http://www.degonline.org/pressreleases/2011/D
EG_MID_YEAR_2011_REPORT.pdf">PDF</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the second quarter, the number of Blu-ray homes grew 16 percent over 2010
(inclusive of [Blu-ray Disc] set-tops, PS3s and [Home Theaters in a Box],)
bringing the total household penetration of all Blu-ray compatible devices to
more than 31.6 million U.S. homes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of this put together leads me to believe that the L.A. Times’ headline,
“Consumers now spending more renting movies than buying them,” is only half
the story. Viewers are making it clear that they prefer the convenience of
subscription services, but they are also showing a willingness to embrace
higher quality distribution. This suggests that people only want to own movies
that look incredible on their HDTVs. While Netflix’s HD streaming looks good,
Blu-rays look better. Plus, subscription streaming services still have paltry
HD offerings.</p>

<p>What I don’t understand is why Hollywood has been biding its time with Blu-
ray. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_definition_optical_disc_format_war">format
war</a>
ended in 2008, yet I have only found a single store (the <a href="http://store-locator.barnesandnoble.com/store/2278">Upper East Side
Barnes &amp; Noble</a>) that
actually keeps Blu-rays organized by genre instead of alphabetically. Best Buy
even still keeps them segregated from the well organized DVD selection, tucked
away like some kind of second class disc. Consumers have gone not just to the
better deal, but the more fun experience. Looking for what to watch on Netflix
is enjoyable, especially given the company’s varied categories.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> That layer
of discovery has been removed from picking out Blu-ray discs.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to answer the question “Who cares about any of this besides
studio executives?”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The main thing everyone should be on the lookout for
is giving away a good thing. The other day I wrote that I feel like
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/08/06/digital-killed-the-film-
star/">filmmakers rushed into digital
moviemaking</a> at the expense of celluloid film. It’s extremely difficult to revive a
format once it’s gone<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and DVD and Blu-ray will go the way of the dodo if
consumers aren’t supporting it. We should always be looking to the future and
embracing new technologies, but when the quality is lower and the selection
more scant, we might find ourselves without a way to find great looking home
video at some point. Blu-ray may be the last physical format we ever welcome
into our homes. Here’s hoping that whatever succeeds it doesn’t do so at the
cost of quality.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Foreign Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy”.</p>

<p>think we know which direction consumers lean.</p>

<p>are far less lucrative than DVD/Blu-ray sales. But no one really cares if poor
Hollywood is counting beans on an $8+ billion industry. That’s their problem.</p>
