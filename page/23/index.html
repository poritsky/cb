  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/12/instagram.jpg" title="Instagram" /></p>

<p>Instagram&rsquo;s <a href="http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/">new Terms of Use</a> went live yesterday (they take effect January 16th) and, well, everyone is up in arms. Nilay Patel has a great piece over at The Verge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on what the terms <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/18/3780158/instagrams-new-terms-of-service-what-they-really-mean">do and don&rsquo;t mean</a>.</p>

<p>Though everyone&rsquo;s talking about the paragraph on how they plan to use users&rsquo; photos to generate ad revenue, I&rsquo;m more interested in the lines that precede it. Let me break it up (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hooray!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide <strong>license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, except that you can control who can view certain of your Content</strong> and activities on the Service as described in the Service&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, available here: <a href="http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/">http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-free mumbo-jumbo is pretty common.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It means that you give the company license to use your work on their service.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> weird about Instagram&rsquo;s terms, though, is that it doesn&rsquo;t make clear what the limits of this license are as some other companies do.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/icloud/en/terms.html">Apple&rsquo;s iCloud Terms of Service</a>, which includes use of Photo Stream:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except for material we may license to you, Apple does not claim ownership of the materials and/or Content you submit or make available on the Service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hooray again?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/N5nD7PDQXWY?t=47s">Whatever</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, by submitting or posting such Content on areas of the Service that are accessible by the public or other users with whom you consent to share such Content, you grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and <strong>publicly display such Content on the Service solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available</strong>, without any compensation or obligation to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By my armchair reading, this stipulation gives users a bit of a cudgel should Apple suddenly decide it wants to get (deeper) into the ad business. Apple only has the right to do with your photos whatever you ask it to.</p>

<p>Yahoo!, which owns Flickr, <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html">takes a similar tone</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display <strong>such Content on the Yahoo! Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plus Flickr makes it simple for you to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#87">set a license on your photos</a>.</p>

<p>Google, whose <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com">Picasa</a> is basically a Google+ front-end nowadays, injects <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">plain english into their terms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the same ol&rsquo; royalty-free gobbledygook for a few lines before this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you&rsquo;re a jet, <a href="http://youtu.be/exGJsv6ZNlo?t=20s">you&rsquo;re a jet all the way</a>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>By contrast Apple and Yahoo! explicitly state the license is terminated once you remove your photos from the service. Instagram? It&rsquo;s less clear to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), <strong>but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service</strong> (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed immediately by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Licenses granted <em>to you</em>. I&rsquo;m no lawyer, but it sounds like that license you granted <em>to Instagram</em> stays put even after you delete your account.</p>

<p>That is, unless you delete your account before January 16, 2013. That&rsquo;s exactly what I plan to do once I get all of my photos off of the service. I&rsquo;ve already downloaded my photos through <a href="http://instaport.me/">Instaport</a>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> but that service doesn&rsquo;t pull down your caption or metadata. I don&rsquo;t know if Instagram&rsquo;s API even allows for full metadata extraction, but I&rsquo;m on the prowl for a tool that gives me a more complete version of my files.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t begrudge Instagram their efforts to monetize their service, nor Facebook&rsquo;s attempt to get a bit of money back on their billion dollar investment.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> That doesn&rsquo;t mean I need to be a part of it though.</p>

<p>And so I&rsquo;m moving to Flickr. Their new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/iphone">iOS app</a> is slick and has renewed interest in the social photo-sharing service. I&rsquo;ve been an on-again-off-again Pro user for years. Soon I&rsquo;ll start tinkering again on what was once one of my favorite online communities. Perhaps it will be again.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Instagram under the new terms will be like. Maybe I&rsquo;m being irrational, but I don&rsquo;t think so. The truth is I don&rsquo;t want to have to worry about whether my photos will be used to sell products. That is unless I&rsquo;m getting a cut.</p>

<p>So if you want to check out my pics, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/poritsky">I&rsquo;ll be over on Flickr</a>, snapping away. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks to the New York Film Academy for sponsoring the candler blog this week.</em></p>

<p>Anyone who thinks digital games are for kids is missing out on just how popular gaming has become. A full 40 percent of the total U.S. population plays one or more digital game at least once a month, which has turned it into a multibillion-dollar juggernaut.</p>

<p>Of course, there are those very avid players who play, on average, 18 hours per week on a digital game console, a personal computer or handheld device such as a smart phone or tablet. It is largely from this subset come the game developers of tomorrow, those attending the <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/game-design-school/" rel="nofollow">Game Design School</a> at the New York Film Academy.</p>

<p>Game designers are not necessarily computer programmers, although some attend the academy with that in their backgrounds. Students tend to be enthusiastic gamers, the kinds of people who enjoy the play and have their own ideas of games they would like to develop. Beyond the genre of World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, Runes of Magic and EverQuest II, “serious games” are a growing part of educational and business training.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I have no idea what strikes a note with sitting Senators and representatives. But I know what I feel. Here’s what I sent to my representatives in Washington. Be my guest to copy this template.</em></p>

<p>Dear <strong>__</strong>_____,</p>

<p>I am writing you to ask that you take the necessary steps to end gun violence in the United States.</p>

<p>I am haunted by the imagery and the stories coming out of Newtown, Connecticut. This massacre is a moment of national mourning. But it also points to a grave national failing. We, collectively, failed the students at Sandy Hook Elementary. It is time to end the ongoing violence in this country. Only elected officials like yourself, <strong>__</strong>_____, can right this injustice.</p>

<p>I was in junior high school when the shootings at Columbine High School took place. That event rocked the nation and forced children, like myself at the time, to confront the very real dangers of the world. The similarities between Columbine and the school I attended growing up in Pennsylvania were daunting. If it could happen there, it could happen anywhere.</p>

<p>[Sir or Madam], that was over thirteen years ago. Nothing has changed.</p>

<p>I can no longer abide this destruction, this bloodbath being perpetrated on American soil. I put it to you, <strong>__</strong>_____, and your colleagues in Washington to save us from ourselves; to protect us from the killing machines that have taken too many lives in this country this year alone.</p>

<p>The time for complacency is over. The time for feints and denialism and bickering has passed. You must act now to make it more difficult for anyone to get a gun. You must act to limit the firepower available on the market. You must end the illegal gun trade that goes on in the US and regulate the legal sale of weapons so that killers cannot perpetrate these mass shootings anymore.</p>

<p>As a child I thought that there could never be an event more tragic than Columbine. How many more times must I be proven wrong? How many lives will it take before congress stands up and demands that something be done to stop this senseless violence.</p>

<p>I beg of you to effect change, <strong>__</strong>_____. I ask you to save the lives of countless Americans with your vote. End gun violence now.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jonathan Poritsky</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now I assume most readers have heard of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/nyregion/shooting-reported-at-connecticut-elementary-school.html">tragic shooting</a> at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Just after 9:30am today an adult gunman opened fire throughout the school. As of this writing, 27 are reported dead, 18 of them children.</p>

<p>The incident has clogged all of my social feeds, with people, myself included, offering condolences, prayers, opinions, ruminations and the like. Beneath all of it, though, is a sort of backlash against those who bring up politics. Either it’s too soon or too opportunistic or too ghoulish to talk about such things at this juncture.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Fuck that.</p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

<p>Americans are being slaughtered. Coast to coast. Regardless of age, race, religion. At schools, movie theaters, houses of worship and on city streets. We have, to put it mildly, a big problem.</p>

<p>So let’s figure it out.</p>

<p>The most important thing for us to do today, as a nation, is to recognize that we have a problem, that there have been a string of senseless murders that have made 2012 a depressingly bloody year. And recognizing that we can and must do something to prevent them.</p>

<p>That’s not being political. That’s being an adult.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, an app I’ve used every day for years, is getting a big update in the coming months. Andrew Pepperrell, Alfred’s developer, just <a href="http://blog.alfredapp.com/2012/12/14/v2-sneak-peek-workflows/">revealed a huge new feature</a> coming to the application-launcher-but-so-so-much-more called “Workflows.”</p>

<p>It sounds similar to Automator workflows but built right into the Alfred’s friendly and simple search bar. Here’s the example that (obviously) caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="should-i-watch-this-movie">Should I watch this movie?</h4>

  <p>Movies weren’t created equal, so before I start watching a movie, I can search for “movie dark knight rises” to decide whether or not I should watch it. This will launch a YouTube search for the trailer in Chrome (because I don’t have Flash installed in Safari), an IMDB search using a default web search, and a Rotten Tomatoes custom search I’ve created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appears to be one of the simpler examples, but it gives a nice idea of what this thing will be capable of.</p>

<p>If you buy the Alfred Power Pack, which unleashes a slew of nerdy features like AppleScript and Shell access, for £15 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=£15+in+%24">$24.21</a>)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> today you’ll get a free upgrade to v2 when it’s released next year.</p>

<p>As an added incentive, Andrew is offering purchasers of the Mega Supporter license early beta access to v2 in January. For £30 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=£30+in+%24">$48.38</a>) you also get lifetime updates to the app, so when v3 drops in 2016 you’ll be all set.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anil Dash waxes poetic (and, in my opinion, accurately) about <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">the Web of yesteryear</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To the credit of today’s social networks, they’ve brought in hundreds of millions of new participants to these networks, and they’ve certainly made a small number of people rich.</p>

  <p>But they haven’t shown <em>the web itself</em> the respect and care it deserves, as a medium which has enabled them to succeed. And they’ve now narrowed the possibilites [sic] of the web for an entire generation of users who don’t realize how much more innovative and meaningful their experience could be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Owning your identity on the Web is so retro.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been pondering collaborative writing workflows of late since David Wain <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/11/27/systematic-20/">brought it up in conversation with Brett Terpstra</a>. Version control systems like Git and Subversion seem like reasonable options, but the trouble is you generally have to be a coding nerd to wrap your head around them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gitboxapp.com/">Gitbox</a> is one of those apps that cuts right through the bull. If you’re interested in Git but don’t know where to start, it’s a great option to get you up and running. Sure, it’s got power tools built in so you can go nuts with branches and, um, tags and things. Of all the Git apps out there Gitbox feels the most Mac-like and intuitive to me. Work with your files, commit and push. Easy.</p>

<p>I recommend you set up a free, private Git repository over at <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com">Beanstalk</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and start pushing files to it with Gitbox. That’s how I learned that version control doesn’t have to be scary, and might even be useful for creative work.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Gitbox is on sale for $9.99. (The free version limits you to a single repository.) Use <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Oajfc*AWWvY&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=5573&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgitbox%2Fid403388357">this link to buy it</a> and I’ll get a few pennies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Videos you’ve purchased or rented with Amazon Instant Video will show up instantly on your Apple device once you download and sign into the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a consumer this is welcome news.</p>

<p>As a media commentator I have no idea how Amazon makes money on this stuff. I always thought their content libraries acted as a Trojan horse to lock you into their ecosystem so you would buy more devices (a la iTunes and Apple). But if you can get an equivalent (superior?) experience on Apple’s devices, why buy a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (blah blah blah) at all?</p>

<p>Which brings me back around to talk in my consumer voice. If Amazon is practically giving this content away even if I don’t buy their devices, will my TV shows in the cloud still be around in the future?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It’s moves like this (immediately convenient but confusing over the long term) that make me want to back myself out of Amazon’s content library. It just feels unsustainable, which ain’t great since they hold onto my digital wares in perpetuity.</p>

  <p>…AppleScript allows me to add my <em>own</em> features to the apps I use most—features that may well not make sense for the typical user but which save me time and aggravation.</p>

<p>Nice little history of one of my favorite aspects of OS X.</p>

<p>By the way: I queued up this link post by <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/10/10/textexpander-applescript-and-octopress/">triggering an AppleScript</a> with a <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> snippet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A.O. Scott reviewed <em>Consuming Spirits</em> <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/movies/consuming-spirits-an-animated-film-by-chris-sullivan.html">for the New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a time when animation is expected to be computer-generated, three-dimensional and relentlessly upbeat, Mr. Sullivan’s film is flat, handmade and melancholy, a dark and painful fantasy for grown-ups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/04/24/tribeca-12-review-consuming-spirits/">loved</a> it when I saw it at Tribeca earlier this year.</p>

<p>If Hollywood’s bloat and Oscar-chasing has you down, go check out Chris Sullivan’s excellent film. Right now it’s playing in New York but hopefully it will tour around the arthouse circuit.</p>

<p>If you can’t wait, check out some of Sullivan’s <a href="http://vimeo.com/sullivananimation/videos">other work on his Vimeo page</a>.</p>
