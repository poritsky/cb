<p>There are a few different ways a film can suck, but for the sake of argument I’d like to boil it down to two:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The above-the-line talent was more concerned with getting into festivals/getting bought than making a coherent piece of work.</li>
  <li>The above-the-line talent made a film they believe in and the resulting film is maybe not so great.</li>
</ol>

<p>Daniel Schechter’s <em>Supporting Characters</em>, thankfully, falls into the latter category. It’s has its issues and spends the last thirty minutes trying to pay for its sins, but overall it’s an honest piece of work. The problems I have with it are ones that could only be corrected by Schechter making a different film. I’m glad he didn’t because what we have is a mostly enjoyable, if sloppy, piece of work.</div>

<p>I like to whine about how &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; the Tribeca Film Festival is, about how similar most of its Amer-indie slate feels.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> As many workshopped talkies as one may endure, this is still New York City, historically a hotbed of experimental cinema. There is no handbook for these adventurous filmmakers; no one telling them the gun must go off in the third act. It is this freedom that allows them to come up with some of the wildest films imaginable and execute them on a (sometimes literal) shoestring.</p>

<p>Chris Sullivan&rsquo;s <em>Consuming Spirits</em> is listed as an experimental animation, but I think that&rsquo;s a bit of an unfair description. While its technique of handmade 16mm animation certainly qualifies it as a trial in patience, it is, at its core, a narrative. The &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; is a mere playfulness with time, scale and reality; it may even be too tame to be considered all that experimental in some circles. I imagine it is listed as such because no one else in the fest wanted it, and that&rsquo;s a shame.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shawn Blanc just published the <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/04/clicky-keyboards/">clicky keyboard blog post</a> to end all clicky keyboard blog posts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mechanical keyboards like the Das are bulky, loud, and fantastic for typing. Compared to the slim Apple keyboards, the Das is different in every way except that the end result is still the same: words get onto the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been interested in a Matias Tactile Pro 3 for years,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I’ve never had the guts to shell out for it. Shawn offers in-depth perspective on the three big Mac mechanical keyboards: the Tactile Pro, the Das Keyboard and the Apple Extended Keyboard II.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m sure I will revisit and reread Shawn’s post many times before I finally break down and buy one of these keyboards. Frankly, if the Das wasn’t so needlessly ugly (unlike Shawn, I can’t get over the ridiculous typeface on the keys) I’d probably order one right now.</p>

<p>But I need to stop shopping and <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/04/20/text-and-death/">just write</a>, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/04/itext-chart.png" title="iOS Text Editors" /></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t be the only one who looks at Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s prolific <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">iOS text editors comparison chart</a> and thinks of his own mortality, can I?</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, the chart in question is worth a peek even if you don&rsquo;t care about iOS text editors. The methods Terpstra used to build the thing prove what a web wizard he really is. Most of the info was crowd-sourced into a Google spreadsheet and then built straight into the niftily designed chart. It&rsquo;s an excercise in efficiency, a sort of data parkour.</p>

<p>What strikes me is the absurdity of the chart itself. It&rsquo;s massive, covering not only every known text editor in the App Store but also every feature. And it gets pretty granular. &ldquo;Reading Time,&rdquo; the ability of an app to display the approximate time it will take to read the current document based on its length, gets its own row, for example.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to mock Terpstra&rsquo;s product. Not at all. It is an invaluable snapshot of what is available right now in an increasingly cluttered marketplace. As I&rsquo;ve written before, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/20/my-text-problem/">I buy a lot of text editing apps</a>. I use them all for different writing tasks or to cater to my different moods.</p>

<p>What freaks me out is how excited I was when Brett published his chart. Looking at it, all I can think is how ridiculous the whole plain text craze has become. I&rsquo;m as guilty as anyone of obsessing over the tiny details in these apps, and I love that there is now a resource where I can quickly drill down the exact feature I need. Here&rsquo;s the thing, though: <em>the perfect text editor doesn&rsquo;t exist</em>.</p>

<p>I should know, I&rsquo;ve bought (almost) all of them.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve learned anything from perusing Brett&rsquo;s chart, it&rsquo;s that I need to stop worrying about apps and just write more. It really grates on me when people spout motivational platitudes like that<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I think it&rsquo;s applicable here.</p>

<p>Life is short and the considerable time I spend wondering which app has the best Markdown implementation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is time thoroughly wasted. Write more, shop less; all of this will end someday.</p>

<p>So thanks, Brett, for the perspective.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Many claim that voiceover (and I am cheating a little bit here by using &#8220;voiceover&#8221; and &#8220;narration&#8221; as interchangeable, even though they&#8217;re somewhat different things) is not very rigorous, and yet some of the most rigorous films ever made – Bresson’s <em>Diary of a Country Priest</em> and <em>A Man Escaped</em>, Alain Resnais’s <em>Last Year at Marienbad</em> – utilize it. We mouth to ourselves the idea that there’s something impure about narration, but when it pops up in the right situation we embrace it. Sometimes I wonder if we just create these rules so other people can break them.</p><footer><strong>Bilge Ebiri</strong> <cite><a href="http://ebiri.blogspot.com/2012/03/narration-voiceover-and-shape-of-world.html">Narration, Voiceover, and the Shape of the World</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I’m as guilty as anyone of rolling my eyes when I hear voiceover narration, and in many cases it’s because I ascribe to the exact “rules” Ebiri calls into question. Perhaps I am simply disappointed in how poorly this uniquely cinematic technique is often employed, not with the technique itself.</p>

<p>I’m glad Ebiri took the time to thoroughly discount the belief that voiceover is inherently flawed or a lazy crutch, offering some great, classic examples.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/04/400-blows-milk-still.jpg" title="Doinel Taking Milk" /></p>

<p>Not <em>every</em> piece Matt Singer publishes over at Criticwire makes me want to respond in kind here, but most of them give me an itchy trigger finger.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This afternoon, he posted a piece flatly titled “<a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/critics-and-piracy">Is it Okay For Critics to Pirate Movies?</a>” which brings the critical community (back) into the never-ending shitstorm that is The Piracy Conversation.</p>

<p>Mind you, his is a response to Mike D’Angelo’s braggadocious “<a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/critics-notebook-is-it-wrong-to-download-pirated-movies-not-quite-says-one-critic">Critic’s Notebook: Is It Wrong to Download Pirated Movies? Not Quite, Says One Critic</a>” from last week.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The gist of D’Angelo’s piece was that he doesn’t “feel terribly guilty about downloading high-def copies of films that nobody in America has any interest in renting to me.”</p>

<p>Back to Singer for now. He dips his toes in with a bit more gravitas than D’Angelo’s I’m-right-because-I-want-to-be-right boorishness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should a critic have access to any film he wants? A critic’s talents are directly proportional to his or her film knowledge. But financially speaking, film criticism is in even worse shape than video retail. Film critics can’t afford to drop $40 a pop for Criterion Blu-rays. Does playing by the rules doom a film critic to a certain degree of ignorance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we should decouple criticism from piracy. Sure, we write about this stuff and maybe turn a few pageviews into precious pennies (or get paid in burgers or, less often, crisp twenty dollar bills), but does that really pose any more of a conflict? There are rare instances when I think the two are part of the same conversation, like when a <a href="http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2009/04/fox-movie-critic-reviews-20th-century.html">critic reviewed a leaked workprint</a> of <em>X-Men: Origins: Wolverine</em> in 2009 (hey, 3 years ago yesterday!). Otherwise, what we’re talking about is a practice whose critics say shouldn’t be done by anyone, anywhere, ever.</p>

<p>That being said, most of us whining to the wind about this are absolutely students of cinema. We love the medium and we aim to see as many films as possible, often bragging to one another about how many and how often because we <em>really want people to know</em>. We can’t afford to own every film ever (though some try to) so we go out of our way to be able to see films on the cheap. We spend a day at the multiplex theater-hopping, we get credentialed at festivals, we write for free in exchange for screenings, we get publicists to send us their storeroom. How else do you expect us to see this stuff?</p>

<p>The Piracy Conversation got out of control on Saturday when Kim Voynar published a response to D’Angelo, “<a href="http://moviecitynews.com/2012/03/piracy-again-arrrrggggh/">Piracy, Again? Arrrrrggggh.</a>” She argues that the world is crumbling around us and thereby movies aren’t important, or something.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> There’s really no sense in arguing with people at the polar ends of this debate. Blog posts about piracy rarely resolve anything or, for that matter, make a point, but they’re good for pageviews and comments. So around we go. (Keep reading, though!)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s time again to blog about blogging. I wanted to share a bit about my Octopress setup, specifically how I was able to travel to SXSW this year with nothing but my iPad and could still update this site (most of the time). Tuck in, I’m going to head into some nerdy weeds here.</p>

<p>Octopress is a static blog generator based on Jekyll. I switched the candler blog to it from Wordpress <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/10/more-than-a-new-design/">back in January</a>, but only after I confirmed that I would be able to run the site from my iPad. This is roughly what I came up with back then. The short of it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a new post on iOS in a Dropbox plain text editor and save it to <code>/Dropbox/path/to/site/source/_posts</code></li>
  <li>Generate and commit the site via SSH to a private repository hosted on Beanstalk</li>
  <li>Auto-deploy the <code>public</code> folder to my Web server</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how it’s done.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was at SXSW I interviewed Lena Dunham and Judd Apatow. The full interview just went live over at <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/lena-dunham-and-judd-apatow/34561">Heeb Magazine</a>. Here’s one of my favorite bits which came up as we were discussing Dunham’s move to television:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judd Apatow: Lena was just happy to not have to be responsible to feed the crew herself.</p>

  <p>Lena Dunham: It truly was. The amount of anxiety I had during takes about whether there had been enough pizza…I didn’t realize how much it was taking away from my ability to express myself artistically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this because it sounds like a line written for one of Dunham’s characters. Which gets to the heart of why she is such an interesting filmmaker to watch: she is refreshingly honest.</p>

<blockquote><p>A landscape of pieces playfully joined together. A sense of temporality, randomness. Almost like drift wood. Or maybe something more architectural. Modular pieces, loosely assembled, like a group of little islands. A congregation of rafts as an auditorium. Archipelago Cinema.</p><footer><strong>-Ole Scheeren</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.buro-os.com/archipelago_cinema/">Archipelago Cinema</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Now this is cool. From March 9th to 13th, while I was getting my cinematic fill <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/03/09/viral/">at SXSW</a>, Tilda Swinton and Apichatpong Weerasethakul served as curators for a new and unique film festival, <a href="http://www.filmontherocksyaonoi.com/">Film on the Rocks Yao Noi</a>. Started by Nat Sarasas and Chomwan Weeraworawit, the fest appears to be a highly free-form exploration of art, cinema and space, as well as a boon to the Thai film industry which now enjoys some time in the spotlight after Weerasethakul’s 2010 Palme D’Or win for <em>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</em>.</p>

<p>The event took place on an archipelago off Thailand. Italian Vogue’s Carlotta Loverini Botta was <a href="http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/parties-events/2012/03/film-on-the-rocks-yao-noi-tilda-swinton">on-hand for the festivities</a>. Here’s what was she wrote about the fest’s second day<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…we were actually taking part in the village’s celebration day, in which the screen was mounted in the middle of a market/fun-fair open to the population of all villages and screening one of the historic pieces of the Festival’s partner, the Thai Film Foundation and Film Archive, the first Thai silent horror movie dubbed live by actors so talented that it was impossible to choose between watching the screening or the actors’ performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The real centerpiece of the fest, however was the “Floating Auditorium” pictured above. The impermanent theater, erected between two rocks, was designed by architect Ole Scheeren based on a design “borrowed” from local Thai fishermen. From the <a href="http://www.buro-os.com/archipelago_cinema/">project’s Web site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local fishermen farm lobsters on rafts. Wooden frames are tied by rubber straps to foam blocks wrapped in mosquito nets. A simple construction. A local technique. Adopted to build the floating cinema.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scheeren has toyed with outdoor cinema spaces before. In 2006 he designed the “<a href="http://www.buro-os.com/marfa-drive-in/">Marfa Drive-In</a>,” a new take on an old idea in the West Texas desert. It’s always nice to see public art and cinema collide like this. I am particularly intrigued by the way Scheeren is approaching public viewing in these projects.</p>

<p>Honestly, watching a movie at sea, where the screen and the projector are on different platforms, sounds disorienting. I’m sure the lagoon waters are calm, but what of the people fidgeting on the platform?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/13024/1/film-on-the-rocks-yao-noi">Caroline Lever at Dazed Digital</a> seemed to have no complaints:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surrounded by rocks forming a natural theatre, we reclined on modular rafts held together like a cluster of islands. And with the undulating waves under us, and the stars above, we returned to a state of naivete and wonder to Herbert Brenon’s <em>Peter Pan</em>, accompanied by a magnificent live score performed by Simon Fischer Turner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brenon’s 1924 silent picture is the first filmed version of J. M. Barrie’s play.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I’ve never seen it, but a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8njtIAQsqs">quick search on YouTube</a> gives a brief idea of one of the tale’s pivotal moments.</p>

<p>I imagine the screen border, wobbling near the picture’s edges, would make some viewers (like me) a bit uneasy. But perhaps that is the point. Why do an eminently “indoor” activity like watching a movie against such a beautiful backdrop? Could cinema ever recreate the beauty of sitting among friends on a raft in the evening? Does the space trump the film completely, and if so is that a problem?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://filmontherocksyaonoi.tumblr.com/">Film on the Rocks tumblr</a> has some great photos and stories from the four day event.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two interesting posts went live as I was headed to bed tonight. The first (that I noticed) was from Matt Singer at Criticwire, following up on his aforelinked “<a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/critics-of-everything">Critic of Everything</a>” post. Tonight’s post was a response to my “<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/03/25/critic-of-everything/">Criticizing Everything</a>” piece from yesterday. Here’s what he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe it is my wishy-washiness coming out, but I kind of want to have it both ways on this issue. I want to be able to exalt “The Raid: Redemption” on the relative merits of its meticulously choreographed fight scenes, breathtaking long takes, and inventive use of camera placement; as an exemplar of technique in the world of modern action, the film is certainly without recent equal. But I also want to remind the people who have proclaimed “The Raid” the greatest action film in decades (like the unnamed critic who did so on <a href="http://collider.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Raid-Redemption-poster.jpg">the film’s poster</a> that action films are more than savvy technique. Plot, characters, and dialogue matter too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Singer rightly points out, this is a never-ending discussion. The question of how we quantify a film’s “goodness” is something all reviewers struggle with. Which brings me to the other piece that went live tonight.</p>

<p>In my post yesterday, I wrote about how I agreed with most of Roger Ebert’s review of <em>The Raid: Redemption</em>. Tonight, Ebert <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2012/03/hollywoods_highway_to_hell.html">posted a solemn reflection</a> on why his review puts him “way out of step with other critics.” Essentially, he enters the same conversation from another angle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I began, I found the star rating system to be absurd. I still do. But I thought I’d found a way to work with it. I’d take a “generic approach.” Instead of pretending a star rating reflected some kind of absolute truth, I’d give stars based on how well I thought a movie worked within its genre and for its intended audience. A four-star rating might indicate the movie transcended generic boundaries. For example, what genre does “The Tree of Life” or “Synecdoche, NY” belong to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what am I saying? “The Raid: Redemption” failed as a generic success because it simplified its plot too much? Not really. It <em>is</em> a generic success. And yet my heart sank and I asked myself: Is this all they want? Are audiences satisfied with ceaseless violence, just so long as they can praise it for being “well choreographed?” Is there no appreciation for human dimension, meaning, and morality?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ebert is someone whose writing never fails to amaze me. He is a prolific critic, a paragon of a tweeter and an incredibly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RogerEbert/posts/284875718232348">generous linker</a>. This piece, titled “Hollywood’s highway to Hell,” is just plain stunning. He at once regrets his decision to pan the film but admits it would go against his taste to praise it. He pats other critics on the back and agrees with their laudatory quotes, but still admits that the film delivers little. Ebert, it seems, is still working out how to be a critic of everything.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s any shame in being the odd man out for panning <em>The Raid</em>. It does, however, hearten me to know that Ebert is still toiling with the demons of movie reviewing. You’d think he’d have had these battles long ago and figured them out. The truth is, though, that criticism will never be the same as long as the movies keep changing. From Ebert, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I began as a film critic, the word “genre” suggested a type of film that had highly developed traditions, possibilities and richness. Now it suggests a marketing decision.</p>

  <p>These days, audiences enter a film like this with tunnel vision. They know what they want, and they’d better find it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to think that cinema is much richer than what audiences expect to find at the multiplex, but it feels like that’s exactly what we see week in and week out. It feels like we are getting what we pay for and nothing more. That’s how I felt about <em>The Raid: Redemption</em>; it delivered a wet dream of a slug-fest but was otherwise thin. I think we can do better.</p>
