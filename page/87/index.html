  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/sc1.jpg" alt="Sooner Cinema Cover" />Hold onto your hats folks, it’s time for the
first ever candler giveaway. Readers, you have been very good to me this
month, so it’s time to give something back. After last month’s <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/22/starting-out-in-film-now-what/">Starting Out
In Film</a>
post gained some traction thanks to some linkage from the excellent blog <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/17/full-deadcenter-
coverage/">Self
Reliant Film</a>, you came back for more in June. Many of you were intrigued by my
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-
wave-for-filmmakers-a-concept/">Google Wave for Filmmakers</a> post, but there is no question that above all
else you showed up for <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/17/full-deadcenter-coverage/">my coverage of the deadCENTER Film
Festival</a>. In
fact, Oklahoma can now lay claim to the candler blog’s second highest
readership in the U.S. Thanks!</p>

<p>Now to the contest. While I was in Oklahoma City, I popped into the <a href="http://www.fullcirclebooks.com/">Full
Circle Book Store</a>, an incredible local find,
for a signing of a new collection of essays, <a href="http://www.fortysixthstarpress.com/?page_id=265&amp;category=1&amp;product
_id=5">Sooner Cinema: Oklahoma Goes to
the Movies</a>. I’ve only just started to read it and it is fascinating. The authors
of this book take an interesting look at the cinematic history of the Sooner
State. Trust me, this is the only book of its kind. If you are fascinated by
local cinema, American history, or just a new take on American filmmaking,
this will be a nice book for your collection.</p>

<p><strong>I have one copy to give away and it is autographed by five of the authors.</strong> The rules are simple, leave a comment on this post with a legitimate e-mail address. That’s it! I don’t care if you use an alias and I will not be making a mailing list out of this data, I simply need your e-mail to contact you if you win. Please leave only one comment on any topic.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.starpulse.com/Photos/Previews/Whatever-Works-
movie-18.jpg" alt="" />After 2004’s <em>Melinda and Melinda</em>, there were rumblings among
the faithfuls that follow Woody Allen’s every move that the master had lost
touch with the New York, that the film felt more like real estate porn, they
decried, than an actual New York story. We want the old Woody back, they
decried, we want to be enchanted by the greatest city in the world yet again!
Following a four film love affair with Europe, Mr. Allen returns home to the
big apple, but not to quell the masses. With _Whatever Works _he comes at us
swinging with a very clear message: that we should shut the hell up and let
him be.</p>

<p>The film opens with Boris Yellnikoff, a surly retired physicist played byLarry
David, sitting with a group of friends, prattling off some choice Woody Allen
favorites: the meaninglessness of life, the inherent evil within people, the
realization that everyone on earth is an idiot, and so on and so on. To wow
the die-hards even more, Boris stands up and directly addresses the audience,
launching into a monologue that feels mimeographed right out of <em>Annie Hall</em>.
Stylistically I have no problems with the way this fourth wall breakage
happens, it’s actually quite funny. The trouble is with our lead actor. When
Woody himself bares his soul in his 1977 Oscar-winner, there is an emotional
purity in his words; when Larry David does it today, he is trying to become
something he is not, an actor.</p>

<p>One stormy night, Boris finds a tight little coed, played with outdated
southern panache by Evan Rachel Wood, on his doorstep. Taking pity on her, he
lets her sleep on the couch, for a night, a week, a month, etc. Her name is
Melodie St. Ann Celestine, about as goyishe a name as Yellnikoff is shtetl-
born, and that’s the point. We have a caricature of the New York communist
self-hating Jew scientist and the wide-eyed dumb as dirt southern belle hard-
body thrown into the soup together. Hilarity would have to follow, yes?</p>

<p>Not exactly. As I touched on earlier, most of the trouble is with Mr. David.
He is a writer and producer whose comdic worth is on par with Woody’s. He has
made a name mainly by playing himself, a creative choice borne out of the
realization that he is not an actor. In his HBO series, <em>Curb Your
Enthusiasm</em>, this is all part of the joke. Here, it feels wholly out of place.</p>

<p>The problems may start with our star, but they don’t end there.
Cinematographer Harris Savides and editor Alisa Lepselter , of course under
the tutelage of their director, have dealt this film a one two punch by
showing us a great deal of the frame and holding each shot longer than
necessary. This is extremely common in Woody Allen films, especially ones as
theatrical as <em>Whatever Works</em>, but it puts an incredible onus on our actors.
Ms. Wood seems to have spent so much time toning her accent and her abs that
she forgot about destination. She is lost in that massive frame. Thank
goodness Patricia Clarkson comes along to play her mother, Marietta. Unlike
her young counterpart, Ms. Clarkson slips into the N’Orleans mentality and
lights up the screen; she is larger than life in this role. Also of note is
the always hilarious Ed Begley Jr. who builds one of the most interesting
characters in the film with very little screen time.</p>

<p><em>Whatever Works</em> feels dated, slow and hackneyed. If there is a lesson to be
learned, and I fully believe this is the film’s intention, it is that the New
York City of yore (the 1970s and 1980s) is gone and has been replaced with
something glitzier. Gotham is no longer a place where huddled masses of
artisans, architects and other right-brain types can commingle on a pittance a
day. These days you need capital, both monetarily and fashionably, to stay
afloat in this town.</p>

<p>Woody Allen is breaking our reverie, this so-called love-affair with Manhattan
that audiences are obsessed with. When you ask the wrong questions, he is
telling us, you will get a lame answer. Why don’t you make films like you used
to, Woody? Because they don’t work anymore, idiots. It may seem like
intellectual apologism to say that Woody has a message in this malformed film,
but I think the writing is as clear as day. He is a cinematic master who
continues to grow with every film he makes (despite popular belief, he has
never had a slow period), so just leave him be to make the films he wants,
wherever they may be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://lodim.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/taking-pelham1.jpg" alt="" />Tony Scott
films tend to be violent, profane, and intellectually apropos. The limey
director’s latest, <em>The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3</em>, hits all of those points on
target, though unfortunately, just so. The actioner doesn’t thrill quite as
well as his <em>Deja Vu</em>, nor does it smack of a weekend-long peyote trip like
his brilliant (yeah, I said brilliant) <em>Domino</em>. Still, for a New York action
film, <em>Pelham</em> delivers the goods for most of its run time. To see an NYC
action film that really stinks up a portrayal of Manahttan gunplay, check out
Richard Donner’s <em>16 Blocks</em>.</p>

<p>The only relation this remake has to Joseph Sargent’s 1974 thriller of the
same name is a title, so let’s not bark up that tree of comparitive cinema.
Mr. Scott is a big boy, we can judge his film without the prism of history.
The story follows Walter Garber, an MTA muckity muck sentenced to working a
dispatch mic after a scandal involving Japanese kickbacks. Played by Denzel
Washington, Mr. Garber happens to be on the recieving end of a phone call from
a terrorist who goes by the name of Ryder, played by John Travolta. Having
hijacked a single car of a 6 train and cut off transit along that track, Ryder
demands $10 million and the ability to stay on the line with Garber. So there
you have it, the makings of a tight little thriller. Except, not really.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for this film is to keep a bloodthristy audience
interested during what is essentaially an extended phone call between bad guy
and good guy. Mr. Scott, as you might expect, thinks the best way to keep
these moribund scenes afloat is to whip and wind the camera around Travolta
and Washington while they chat via CB radio. This gets old quite fast. Alone
in the train tracks, there isn’t too much room for shoot ‘em up action, so
Tony Scott dips into his bag and pulls out his biggest trick: intellectual
stimulation.</p>

<p>I could go on for paragraphs and paragraphs about how incredibly relevant this
movie is. Ultimately, this film is about the stock market, but it is also
about terrorism and being American. The hilarious intersection of the two
occurs when one character points out that Ryder doesn’t look like a terrorist.
I was the only one in the theater to laugh at this. It is not lost on Mr.
Scott that we have all but forgotten the Timothy McVeighs of the world and
settled on the Bin Ladens, whose physical appearances makes it that much
easier to malign them. This kind of high-minded U.S. cultural dissection is
the stuff that Mr. Scott has been pumping out his entire career. Pick up a
copy of <em>Days of Thunder</em> if you don’t believe me.</p>

<p>Overall, 2009’s <em>The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3</em> is good enough. Denzel fills out
the boring city employee nicely, though without sacrificing his brooding good
looks. Mr. Travolta, on the other hand, is still trying to reprise his
brilliace in John Woo’s <em>Face/Off.</em> Falling short by a mile, he comes off as a
Hollywood star pretending to be a hardened criminal by cursing profusely and
having neck tattoos. The performances are just one of the departments in which
this movie fails to please on the surface, but if you take the time to pick
the film apart, there is a treasure trove of delectable discussion to be had.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The comedy short has a long and illustrious history in cinema. In modern
times, the art is still alive but exhibition spaces are limited. As a result,
film festivals have become the number one destination for these little films.
deadCENTER has its share of shorts programs, but I was only able to check out
the comedy section because I needed a laugh. Did I get one? Let’s take a look.</p>

<h4 id="ten-for-grandpa---dir-doug-karr">Ten For Grandpa - dir. Doug Karr</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/tenforgrandpa-300x200.jpg" alt="Ten For Grandpa Still" />This slick little short follows a man wondering who
his departed grandfather really was. The camera flows between scenes, across
time, and across rooms to create the illusion of fluidity. This is extremely
well executed, but I do wonder how much of this film actually qualifies as
comedy. If anything is a joke, it seems to be the efforts the filmmakers went
to to pull off these shots. Every time we enter a new space we are supposed to
be wowed into a laugh; the form is so over the top for such a little film. The
choice of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio seems like an arbitrary choice; the piece
may be funnier with more vertical space. Of course, we would lose that
slickness. <em>T__en for Grandpa</em> is tight, well executed, well_ <em>acted, and
fully realized.</em> _Overall, it is a very strong piece and I want to see more
from all involved.</p>

<h4 id="the-last-page---dirkevin-acevedo">The Last Page - dir. Kevin Acevedo</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/thelastpage-300x169.jpg" alt="The Last Page Still" />The best part of this short is the Dodge College
opening logo. Its self-assuredness provided me the biggest laugh all day, but
sadly, all logos must end. The film goes on to depict the terribly tired
premise of a writer envisioning the final page of his novel. The writer goes
for a walk ends in him getting into all kinds of “wacky trouble”. I realize
this is a student film, but still, it is fraught with problems. Again we have
an unjustified 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The biggest issue of all is the runtime.
At 22 minutes, the piece is more than twice as long as there is story. Most
offensively, the laughs are unexplained. Why, Mr. Acevedo, is it funny when a
rotund woman grabs the writer’s crotch? If you are out there, defend your
joke. And to the professors at Dodge College at Chapman University, please
guide your students to kill their favorite babies and cut their pieces down to
size.</p>

<h4 id="the-spam-job---dirpadraic-culham">The SPAM Job - dir. Padraic Culham</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/thespamjob-300x203.jpg" alt="The Spam Job" />Stone faced after the last bit of drek, I was
determined not to laugh once through this cheap-looking documentary, but it
wore me down over time. I couldn’t help but chuckle by the end. Through
interviews and photos, the story of one prankster’s stolen spam becomes
clearer and clearer. It sounds dumb and that is the point. The joke here seems
to be on us for making it through the whole damn story. This “cheap” feeling I
mentioned only adds to the charm of the piece, you simply don’t expect how far
they are willing to take this joke about a can of spam ending up in different
locales across the globe. The piece is a little fat, could be cut down to
size. I could see this as a sketch on a late-night comedy show, that is if Mr.
Culham and friends have any other notes up their sleeves.</p>

<h4 id="cherchez-la-femme---dir-idit-dvir">Cherchez la femme - dir. Idit Dvir</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/chercezlafemme-300x190.jpg" alt="Chercez La Femme Still" />Comedy has a darker side
that is briefly explored in this short. A man dressed like a taco wants to
kill himself over a woman until he finds a friend in another suicidal man with
far different love troubles. Slowly we learn that the man’s wife cheats on him
while he is home, so the taco concocts a plot to kill her off. The film takes
too long to get to very little payoff, though one of the purest laughs during
the shorts program came out of the film. Once the murder is imminent, the
murderer must continue having sex with his victim through tears. As an
audience, we are left with no emotional output except laughter because our
other options simply won’t do given the rest of the film. This one laugh is
impressive, but it doesn’t make up for the slow pace of the rest of the film,
not to mention the pre-required misogyny one needs to find humor throughout.
Ms. Dvir assumes a lot about her audience’s beliefs: that walking tacos are
funny, that promiscuous women are sluts, and that murder is a natural
progression from anger. Focusing in on these muddled corners will help to make
better work in the future.</p>

<p>Sigh. I believe in film criticism as a tool to help filmmakers better their
work over time, but when I am given nothing to work with I feel there is
nothing I can offer. This is how I feel about <em>Tom’s Day Off</em>. It’s such a
mess that I would rather the filmmaker, Justin Stanley, go make something else
and bring it back so I can actually give some critique. Apparently, after
being dumped a lanky bank employee chooses to rob his place of business. Then
he ends up in the back seat of a student driver’s vehicle with no plan. There
are no laughs, no plot, no aesthetic quality to speak of. Mr. Stanley probably
thinks he’s a genius with his use of an inner monologue interspersed with
diegetic dialogue. The bigger question is what place this film has in any film
festival. The 10 minutes of space this took up could have been used so much
better.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/miracleinvestigators-300x202.jpg" alt="Miracle Investigators Still" />The program finished
off with this crowd pleaser. Overall, this is a lame mashup of kung fu action
and outdated church humor. Still, the laughs are there, and that is
respectable for a student film thrown into this mix. The film follows two
priests charged with meting out justice against perpetrators of false
miracles. Unfortunately, this goofy premise never really comes to fruition.
The film bumbles along from joke to joke with a plot that hardly makes any
sense. It seems that it didn’t matter since the laughs were there. The makers
of this film would do better to cut it down to about a 5 minute sketch and
really focus in on each joke. Nonetheless, a valiant effort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Andrew-
Windy-Boy.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/Andrew-Windy-Boy-
300x168.jpg" alt="Still from Our Spirits Don't Speak English" /></a>If you were paying close attention even in the most progressive
of U.S. public schools, odds are you were never made aware of the full extent
to which Native Americans have been maligned by their Euro-Christian
counterparts. Sure, you know it’s a bad history, a dark history, but that was
centuries ago, right? A sobering wake-up call could be found in Steven R.
Heape and Chip Richie’s <em>Our Spirits Don’t Speak English: Indian Boarding
Schools</em>.</p>

<p>The film is a straightforward educational documentary complete with
interviews, photos, re-enactments and the readings of historical texts. It
tells the tale of government and church financed boarding schools whose goal
was to reform Native Americans, to make them more like their white neighbors.
The facts are harrowing. In short, children were taken from their homes into
the schools where their hair was cut, they were forced to speak english, and
slowly the destruction of a culture set in for generations to come. If this is
a topic that interests you you should absolutely <a href="http://www.richheape.com/boarding-school.htm">check out the
film</a>. There isn’t the space
here to get too deep into the facts.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, the film is nothing special, which is fine because the goal is
to directly educate. The topic is so sweeping, so important, that it may be
too difficult for the filmmakers to build an emotional narrative. I won’t
excuse this as I believe this story would find a wider viewership if such a
task were undertaken. The interview with Andrew Windy Boy, pictured above, is
the strongest part of the piece. He spends much of his time on camera in
tears, remembering the darkest pockets of his childhood. Mr. Windy Boy alone
could fill a feature length documentary, but here he is only one piece of the
puzzle. ( I do not want to minimize the stories of the other interviewees by
any means, I am using Andrew as one example.)</p>

<p><em>Our Spirits Don’t Speak English</em> is an important film that reveals a story
that needs to be told before this generation of Native Americans can no longer
tell it. However, it does not feel like the kind of documentary that runs in
festivals. It reads like a book, not as much as a narrative docu. Perhaps I am
too demanding, or perhaps the art of the educational film is lost on me.
Regardless, I would recommend showing this film in schools across the country.
We need to know the extent of our misdeeds as a nation, and <em>Our Spirits Don’t
Speak English</em> exposes a great deal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The internet has been touch and go the past two days, and I’m on a friend’s
computer instead of my own, so I can’t add the usual flair you have come to
know and love to this post. Even with the fest completed, this continues to be
an intensely film-related vacation. After a buffet breakfast at a place called
Ingrid’s Kitchen, I headed over to the best bookstore in Oklahoma City, Full
Circle. Designed with all kinds of nooks and crannies and rolling ladders, it
is a store whose selection is not only Okie specific, but wide ranging. It’s
design encourages discovery and their staff are super friendly. No one paid me
to say that, seriously.</p>

<p>I went to Full Circle because my friend, Sunrise Tippeconnie, was signing a
book in which an essay of his is featured. The book is <em><a href="http://www.fortysixthstarpress.com/?page_id=265&amp;c
ategory=1&amp;product_id=5">Sooner Cinema:
Oklahoma Goes to the Movies</a></em> and I’m in the process of reading it. Quite
interesting. This state has a long history of making movies and being
portrayed in them. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p>The talk of the town right now is Michael Winterbottom’s <em>The Killer Inside
Me</em>, which is shooting here right now. The film has brought stars Casey
Affleck, Jessica Alba, and Ned Beatty. During the final day of deadCENTER they
had blocked off streets downtown and filled them with 1950s cars. Last night I
headed to Cookie’s, a tiny bar with a lot of heart, for the Cast and Crew
more-than-halfway-through-production party. It was a nice time with some
wonderful karaoke singers. The only celeb to show up was Mr. Beatty, and he
was a gentleman.</p>

<p>I love hanging out with film crews. They are so much more tolerable than
filmmakers because they rarely want to talk about movies. After the bar I went
straight to a Sonic for the second time today. For those of you who don’t know
about Sonic, well, you just have to drive until you find one. I got an Ocean
Water Slushie and some onion rings. They tasted delicious after drinking a
Pacifico cerveza.</p>

<p>We are off to the Wichita Mountains now, probably no more film to deal with
today. I still owe you all some reiews and you’ll get them, but probably not
until I’m back in New York. Poke around the site in the meantime, there’s a
lot going on here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 2009 deadCENTER Film Festival has come to an end. It’s been a fun ride
indeed. I saw some good films, I made some good friends, and I discovered a
town that I had never been to before. Oklahoma City is an interesting place
for film. There are many many makers out here and an increasing slate of
productions for people to find work on. The biggest gap to a thriving film
community here seems to be the availability of art house, fringe and repertory
film screening spaces. Once a year, when this festival rolls into town, the
citizens of Oklahoma City get a nice helping of the films that don’t get out
here. They need more, but the fest represents a nice start.</p>

<p>To be honest, I only went to 2 screenings yesterday which I will post about
either later today or tomorrow. It has been a whirlwind few days here and
there is finally a nice reprieve. I’ll be here a few more days touring around.
I will keep you all up to date, especially on film news. Interestingly, I’m
currently at a book signing at a local book store. The book, <em>Sooner Cinema:
Oklahoma Goes to the Movies</em>, features an essay fro my good friend (and future
candler contributor, watch for it) Sunrise Tippeconnie. The book just came
out, otherwise I would have read it in advance to help understand this state a
little better. No matter, as more film related info comes to me, you’ll get
it. Here are some pics from closing night, enjoy.</p>
