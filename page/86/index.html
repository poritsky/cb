  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a month ago I entered a short film into a contest hosted by
culture/event blog <a href="http://www.flavorpill.com">Flavorpill </a>and literary
magazine <a href="http://www.granta.com">GRANTA</a>. The idea was to make a film that
encapsulates the idea of life as a rehearsal. The film I submitted, <em>Process</em>,
managed to win the contest. <a href="http://flavorwire.com/30712/the-rehearsal-project-short-film-contest-
winner-announced">They gave me a lovely writeup for the
film</a>. Watch it here.</p>

<p>I made the film a few months ago from footage I took a few months before.
While hanging out with my friend Nazy, I broke out my Nikon D90 and started
filming her. She thought I was going to take a still photo any minute, not
realizing at first that I was recording our conversation. From about 15
minutes of footage I snipped together this little piece. (Nazy consented to
all this, so don’t be afraid to hang out with me while I have my camera)</p>

<p>The candler blog is specifically a site about film by filmmakers, so I thought
you might like to see a bit of what I do when I’m not picking apart
blockbusters or dolling out career advice. I would love to hear your thoughts
on the piece in the comments, and will happily field any questions about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Farewell, Ben Silverman. I have no doubt that whatever business venture you
and Barry Diller are cooking up will be, if not successful, something that
will generate a great deal of conversation. At the candler blog, we don’t
usually get into the muck and dirt of Hollywood biz talk, so let’s change that
for a brief moment.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mr. Silverman announced his resignation as co-chairman of NBC
Entertainment and NBC Universal TV Studios, a job he has had only two years.
His is an interesting story, the center of which isn’t even the NBC gig at
all, but a company called Reville Productions. Founded in 2002 by Mr.
Silverman, the company has spawned some serious money-makers for a number of
networks. Some big hits include “Ugly Betty”, “The Tudors”, and “The Biggest
Loser”. In a very short amount of time he managed to produce hit after hit,
garnering Emmys and prestige along the way.</p>

<p>But it was a short-run midseason replacement that aired in 2005 that set Mr.
Silverman apart as a power-producer. “The Office” wasn’t an instant hit when
it went on the air, but after the smashing success of <em>The 40-Year Old Virgin</em>
that summer, star Steve Carell became an instant household name. America
wanted more of him and Silverman had his ace in the hole.</p>

<p>After “Friends” went off the air in 2004, it was viewed as the final nail in
the coffin for NBC’s Thursday Night programming. Fondly referred to as Must
See TV through the 1990s, NBC’s late week programming was an unstoppable
juggernaut of success. “ER”, “Seinfeld”, “The Cosby Show”, “Cheers”, “Mad
About You”, and others all found a home on Thursday nights. But as reality TV
took hold with NBC sticking to it’s sitcom guns, as the last decade began the
evening’s popularity waned. Without an institution like “Friends” anymore,
NBC’s Thursday future seemed grim.</p>

<p>“The Office”, on the other hand, managed to buoy both Mr. Silverman’s
prominence and the network’s chances of restoring its former glory. The show
is smart, funny and current. It’s documentary style, a mainstay of the
original UK version, lends an immediacy to the action that audiences have
become so used to in reality programming. Nixing a laugh track and a live
audience lends a sense of purity to the humor: we will laugh when we want to.
This is the sitcom, evolved.</p>

<p>I don’t want to wax poetic too hard on “The Office”. It is, after all, only
building on what the brilliant Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created for
the BBC. Plus other American shows beat it to the punch, specifically
“Arrested Development”, whose intellectual pace became a liability for the
show, leading to cancellation. Unlike that show, “The Office” has found an
audience, and it is huge. Greg Daniels deserves the creative credit for
bringing “The Office” to fruition, but Mr. Silverman’s gift was in getting
into the homes of millions. It was an incredible coup for those longing for
smart situational comedy. Mr. Silverman landed a sweet position at the top of
NBC because of this success, and now he’s on to bigger and better things.</p>

<p>So where are we now? “30 Rock” now makes a nice sandwich of Thursday nights.
After 3 seasons, with a 4th on the way, the show has won the hearts of critics
and Emmy voters alike, but it is still slowly finding the right footing with
the American public. To his credit, Ben Silverman stayed strong and kept
ordering full seasons of this scruffy little show, which is paying off at
least in mindshare. Smarter shows bring smarter viewers, who may be inclined
to stay and buy expensive things.</p>

<p>“Kath &amp; Kim”, another Reville production, was a rather unsuccessful show this
year; it won’t be back, thankfully. The new “Parks &amp; Recreation” (what’s up
with the ampersand in that time slot, right?) starring Amy Poehler showed some
promise in its midseason premiere, but it smacks of mimeographed comedy from
“The Office”. It was also created by Greg Daniels. Probably Mr. Silverman’s
most interesting decision during his tenure was giving an hour long show to
Jay Leno at 10:00pm after his resignation from the Tonight Show. When the
show, whose format is still unclear, premieres this fall, we’ll see whether or
not this maverick move pays off.</p>

<p>Ben Silverman is a very young executive who came to the once number one NBC
two years ago with a single task: raise the network out of fourth place (read:
last place). After two years of trying to bring smarter content to the
airwaves, and in my opinion bringing back the creative energy of the 1990s,
NBC remains in fourth place. The numbers don’t lie, but with a promising fall
schedule orchestrated by the exiting Silverman, we will have to see who gets
to have the last laugh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><img src="http://moviesmedia.ign.com/movies/image/article/937/937389/the-ugly-
truth-20081210040155497_640w.jpg" alt="" />The Ugly Truth</em> is a romantic comedy that is
meant to be a vehicle for Katherine Heigl’s comedic talents. Unfortunately,
she is grossly upstagesd by Gerard Butler’s deft skill in the laughs
department. Instead of driving this pony, she is more often (literally) the
butt of every joke. The film follows Heigl as Abby, an uptight control freak
television producer, who meets her match in Mr. Butler as Mike, a misogynistic
slob who lands a position on her show. Believe it or not, this boring redux of
every other rom com you’ve ever seen is actually an attempt at a smarter kind
of comedy. Going out on a limb, the film keeps the dirt in to earn an R
rating, rendering this a raunchy sex-comedy tailor made for proper ladies. We
know that boys will go see R-rated romps, but will women? Yes, but they’re
going to need something a little more substantial than <em>The Ugly Truth.</em></p>

<p>Written by veterans Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith as well as newcomer
Nicole Eastman, the script saves almost all of the good lines for Mr. Butler’s
chauvinist pig. I can only imagine how they must have relished banging out
lines like “Well thank your pussy for me” for the British beefcake. On the
other hand, they handed Ms. Heigl the word “cock” and asked her to run with
it. As the slick Mike dips behind a couch before Abby answers her door in her
new My-Fair-Lady-ed skin, he calls her back at the last second, only to smack
her ass for an uproarious laugh. He is the power broker here, he is the funny
one.</p>

<p>Ms. Lutz and Ms. Smith are well regarded in the film biz for the spectacular
number they did on Reese Witherspooon’s career with the brilliant <em>Legally
Blonde</em>. Director Robert Luketic was also on-board for that project. The
difference between the two films is not really laughs (they are both chock
full), but rather a seriousness of character. With the Witherspoon film, bimbo
Elle Woods is a dumbass who the writers take very seriously, fine-tuning the
tiniest little laughs that surround her. Here, Abby is just your run of the
mill stuck-up producer type, something that is getting very very tired in this
genre. On the other hand, Mike is the obvious voice of reason wrapped in a
thick layer of angry tirades. It is unfortunate that he is such a strong
voice, I’d rather our protagonist learn something more than a fake orgasm.</p>

<p>Where the film does win is in being a nice adult respite from the kid-centric
summer madness. If you’re tired of things getting all blow’d up everywhere,
<em>The Ugly Truth</em> is certainly a nice way to spend 90 minutes. And hey, it’s
actually about two notches above completely stupid, plus the R-rating will
keep the brats out of the theater. Adults rejoice! We’ve almost got a reason
to head to the movies.</p>

<p>P.S. Its in 2.35:1 cinemascope. What the hell, Mr. Luketic? Let’s fit some of
those laughs in vertically, pal. You lose 2 points for unmotivated choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.weeklyblurb.com/storage/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-
prince2.jpg" alt="" />When adapting a novel to the screen, a director may choose one of
two routes: stick to the facts, especially the plot points, of the original
work, or follow the same emotional arc as the literary forbear, perhaps
treading over a few accuracies along the way. David Yates has opted for the
former in <em>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</em>, but only just so. While
the digital wizards were busy making sure audiences leave the theater
thoroughly wowed, the overall story of this sixth installment seems to have
been left by the wayside.</p>

<p><em>Half-Blood Prince</em> spends most of its time in the troubled world of
adolescent love instead of, you know, that whole end-of-days wizarding war
that’s been going on. Sure there are death eaters and imminent danger and
wands-out moments of intensity, but this film seems to be all about the
snogging gossip around the halls of Hogwarts. It’s not that I don’t care for
these bits of the plot, it’s that these amorous sidelines were always
supplemental to the magic, not fore-fronted.</p>

<p>Our three young stars, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron, and
Emma Watson as Hermione, try their darndest to keep the story moving. They
don’t seem to have been given enough direction to spin memorable performances
out of the choppy screenplay. In six films, the dust on their roles is
beginning to show. The film plays as if they showed up to work each day and
went through the motions. In fairness, these are the roles they’ve been
playing their entire careers; boredom has to set in eventually. Hopefully, as
the cycle draws to a close in the coming years, each will find a way to
reinvent, reinvigorate his or her role.</p>

<p>Just as he did on the previous film, <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix</em>, Mr. Yates delves deeper into the dark side of celluloid. Using a
palette that is mostly black, green and blue (‘cause those colors are scary,
boogey boogey boogey), the point is driven home that the fun and games are
over for our young heroes. The thing is, we knew that already. We got that
from the last one, and it’s been building for years, right?</p>

<p>The <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise of films has become almost like a television
series, not only in terms of its frequency of production but in the tired feel
that permeates the lengthy runtimes. People from all departments appear to be
phoning it in. The special effects are unoriginal and the directing is all
over the place. It is an unfortunate fact that box office success determines a
director’s staying power in any big screen franchise. Given the financial
windfall that has welcomed both films directed by Mr. Yates, we will be forced
to endure at least one more installment as bombastically misguided as <em>Harry
Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>. Another franchise, down the tubes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/07/JLM_crop.jpg" alt="John-Luke Montias Still" />As a blogger, I don’t actually have an
office in which to conduct business and interviews. So when the opportunity
arose to meet with multi-hyphenate John-Luke Montias, the first sport that
came to mind was Central Park near the Upper West Side. Being the sport that
he is, Mr. Montias trucked over to meet me. Waiting on the corner by a hot dog
stand on a warm July day, I began to wonder if so serene a spot was proper for
meeting a man whose film deals in sex-slavery, gangsterism, money laundering,
and grand theft auto. Then I remembered, this is New York City; we’re all in
the soup.</p>

<p>John-Luke studied acting at New York University. After school he did what he
refers to as the whole actor-bartender thing: “I got tired of waiting for the
phone to ring, I was working at a bar in Hell’s Kitchen that had some really
crazy ass characters. I would hear a lot of crazy stories whether I wanted to
or not. Then it dawned on me that this was a great opportunity, so I started
writing.” That compilation of stories would eventually become the director’s
first film, <em>Bobby G Can’t Swim</em>, but he admits that those stories still
permeate his work. From listening to him, you can tell that his ears were
well-chewed during his days serving drinks.</p>

<p>” For that project (<em>Bobby G</em>), I really wanted to hire a director, I just
didn’t know any at the time.” In hopes that the script would actually get
made, Mr. Montias decided he could try a crack at helming. In an effort to
look like he knew what he was doing, he took a course at NYU’s School of
Continuing and Professional Studies in filmmaking. In the end, that film went
on to win numerous awards at festivals around the country.</p>

<p>But, as is the way of life, John-Luke had to drop out of the filmmaking game
for a bit due to family illness and death. “I felt kind of beaten up by the
powers that be. <em>Off Jackson Avenue</em> comes from the feelings that I was
experiencing during that period. As you can see in the film, none of the
characters has an easy time of it. Maybe I was just taking out my frustration
on the poor characters in the movie.” This is certainly accurate. The film
follows a Mexican woman who is sold into prostitution, a Japanese hitman whose
mother is fatally ill, and a bright-eyed hood, played by Mr. Montias, who
dreams of going legit.</p>

<p>More than anything else, <em>Off Jackson Avenue</em> feels like a local film. Too
often we (viewers, not locals) forget that while New York City is an
international center of business, fashion and food (ahhh the food), it is also
a place where people live, work, and do all the same things that rural
Americans do every day. “That’s something I was really striving for,
especially with some of the nooks and crannies in Brooklyn and Queens that
appear in the film. A lot of the places in the film are just places I’ve hung
out in or driven by over the years. For example, the spot where Joey keeps
going to inspect his stolen cars; I used to ride my bike by that building
every day and say ‘Damn, I really should shoot something here’.” He’s
referring to a spot below the BQE in Brooklyn Heights, in case anyone wants to
take an <em>OJA</em> walking tour.</p>

<p>Up next for Mr. Montias is a film called <em>Mother’s Day</em>, about a Brooklynite
who gets in a scuffle with some badies and has to hideout upstate with his
mother who has alzheimer’s. For now, he is promoting <em>Off Jackson Avenue</em>. He
admits that the violent nature of the film has turned off some audiences, but
he is hoping that people will begin to see past that to what is beneath. “Who
knows, it could do really well on DVD,” he says with a smile.</p>

<p>Successful or not, it is his second feature and he has another one in the
works. To me, that translates to a man with a film career. “Acting really
holds no interest for me anymore. I really want to continue writing and
directing.” I ask why he has had a role in all of his films. “Well, you know,
if we need to shoot more, I’m not going anywhere.”</p>

<p><em>Off Jackson Avenue opens July 17th at the Quad Cinema New York.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.worstpreviews.com/images/publicenemies.jpg" alt="" />Too often, we as
viewers fall into filmic ruts. We convince ourselves that our understanding of
a particular topic, character or time period has been perfected; questioning
such concepts would be blasphemy, or at the very least uninteresting.
Collectively, we must be shocked out of such beliefs. With <em>Public Enemies</em>,
director Michael Mann has taken everything we thought we knew about the
gangster film, deconstructed it, and put it back together into something
wholly different and occasionally successful.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp slips into the bad boy role of bank robber John Dillinger. An
opening title card informs us that he was enjoying the golden age of bank
robbing, though this is hardly a heist film. There is some talk of a big
“score” early on, but instead of any major planning going into the robberies,
Dillinger and his partners rob as often as needed to pay the bills. The film
plays more like a biopic than  anything else, but that doesn’t mean it is
wholly impotent in the shoot ‘em up department.</p>

<p>After last summer’s <em>The Dark Knight</em> received praise from all critical
outlets, the citation that seemed to come up most often as a creative
influence was Mr. Mann’s 1995 film <em>Heat</em>. The only thing the two films seemed
to share was a violent acuity, the ability to nimbly bounce between any man’s
ability to invoke pain on bystanders while evoking compassion in the viewer.
Not a small feat on either account, but it seems that the elder director is
back to school us once again on the importance of immediacy in an action film.
What makes Depp’s Dillinger so foreboding is not his physical prowess or his
intellectual superiority, it is his ability to use the tools at his disposal
at any given moments to get precisely what he needs from people.</p>

<p>In one of <em>Public Enemies</em> most brilliant sequences, Dillinger stages a prison
escape that is ingenious only by virtue of its simplicity. With each step that
he takes, Mr. Depp becomes more and more fierce, slowly working his way from
guard to guard, from door to door, until freedom is his. The scene occurs
mostly in a single take, which impels us to become submerged in this moment.
Privy to the act, are we not just as guilty?</p>

<p>Now seems like a good point to bring up Mr. Mann’s insistence on shooting
_Enemies _on HD video instead of film. This is the third consecutive film that
he has shot on video. It still feels like a learning experience for Mann and
company, but one for which future generations of filmmakers will benefit. The
immediacy that I spoke of earlier permeates the screen in three dimensions. To
its core, the image on screen is unpredictable. Feeling almost like a reality
TV show at points, we are stimulated on a level that we normally ignore while
watching a film.</p>

<p>During one of the film’s most violent fits, this visual style plays an
incredible role. After holing up in a cabin in the woods, a gun fight erupts
between the FBI and the gangsters within, resulting in a late night chase
through the woods. Under dark cover, the fluid camera comes along for the
ride. This almost feels like a period version of <em>“Cops” _but plays as less of
a gimmick. Mr. Mann is offering a new way to look at well trodden ground. It
seems that ever since _The G__odfather: Part II</em>, in which cinematographer
Gordon Willis gave early twentieth century Italy and New York a gold sheen, we
have been led to believe that olden times necessitate an olden feel which is
somehow defined cinematically by a clean, classical image. Even if you don’t
think this, we have grown accustomed to it as a film culture. Thank goodness
for renegades like Michael Mann who try to shock us out of such silly
dispositions.</p>

<p><em>Ed. Note: I didn’t mention Christian Bale’s performance in this article
because anyone could have played his part (kind of like in Terminator:
Salvation, snap). Marion Cotillard is wonderful, but there’s only so much I
can write about in one post. Leave added thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/07/thehurtlocker_10.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/07/thehurtlocker_10.jpg" alt="Still from The Hurt Locker" /></a>There are many kinds of war
films. Those that celebrate the heroism of men and women who rise to the
occasion and those that examine the absurd event that is conflict; those that
glorify the gory action on the ground and those that question the human event
in its bloodiest hour. <em>The Hurt Locker</em> manages, quite impressively, to check
off all of the above and then some. It is a heart-stopping thriller set amidst
the modern quagmire that is Baghdad that never lingers long enough to feel
preachy yet manages to suspend you in moments of extreme tension for what
seems like eternity. In other words, it’s a bad ass good time.</p>

<p>Director Kathryn Bigelow, probably most well known for the 1991 surf action
film <em>Point Break</em>, decided to stem the intellectual deconstruction of the war
in Iraq that has hampered most recent attempts to bring the conflict to the
big screen. Instead, she has no bones about making a first rate action
thriller. The opening scene alone, in which a radio controlled robot breaks
just before it can detonate an IED, is worth the price of popcorn. If you
can’t handle it straight away, leave the theater.</p>

<p>In need of a new Bomb Tech on their team, Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist
Owen Eldridge find themselves under the command of Staff Sergeant William
James. James is a reckless cowboy who rarely lets the others in on his half-
cocked plans as they traverse Iraq in search of bombs. The relationship that
the three form is complicated to say the least. In Sanborn we find a
rationalist who offers us a moral grounding. Eldridge is more complex, a man-
child thrown into the war probably trying to prove his strength.</p>

<p>But the most interesting character is certainly Sergeant James, played with
boyish bravado by Jeremy Renner. Acting as if he is an army of one, James
always seems to come out in one piece no matter how stupid his plans seem to
be. As soon as we feel we know him and understand his motivation, he goes and
does something even crazier. Not quite a patriot nor a mercenary, his
character slowly unravels and we begin to see an incredibly strong
deconstruction of modern masculinity. I don’t want to get into the details
because it is the little things in this movie that become shocking to you as
it progresses.</p>

<p>Ms. Bigelow has done what many of Hollywood’s biggest guns have failed to do:
make an interesting film about Iraq that people will actually watch. Steering
clear of political statements, she has crafted a solid character study amidst
the most important international issue our nation is embroiled in. It’s the
Iraq movie we have been waiting for, but we hardly notice that fact as we wipe
the sweat from our brow and stand up from the edge of our seat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/07/otheroscardunce.jpg" alt="Other Oscar Dunce" />I’m sorry, but I am going to have
to hike up my crotchity old man pants and whip my suspenders; it’s time to do
a little ranting about the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
(AMPAS).</p>

<p>Recently, outgoing President Sid Ganis announced that next years Oscar
ceremony will feature 10 Best Picture nominations instead of 5. This
unprecedented (at least in 60 years) announcement was followed by a few lesser
publicized changes. The rules for Best Original Song are now such that there
may not even be an award every year and supplemental awards, such as the
Thalberg or the Honorary Oscar, will be distributed at a separate event. It is
great to see AMPAS blow the dust off of the arcane rule book they have been
following for nearly a century, but other changes are needed. Like what, you
may ask? Good thing you came to the candler blog.</p>

<h3 id="axe-the-best-animated-feature-category-and-fast">Axe the Best Animated Feature Category, and Fast</h3>

<p>Part of the thinking behind expanding the Best Pic pool is to give films that
rarely make it into the running a fighting chance. Comedies, summer
blockbusters and animated features are rarely nominated, but only one of those
genres has been pushed out of the running completely. Instituted in 2001, with
the first award going to <em>Shrek</em>, the Best Animated Feature award was meant to
get gold into the hands of animated filmmakers whose work accounts for an
incredible amount of box office grosses yet is rarely honored at the annual
ceremony. Instead, it has pigeonholed all animated films into one giant lump
that is out of the running of the Academy’s top honor.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, Hollywood and audiences have taken note of animation
auteurs. So many people are required to make an animated film, the makers
often get lost in the shuffle. However, Brad Bird has now become a marketable
name, as have Andrew Stanton and John Lasseter. (These are all Pixar guys, I
know, but hey, they’re the major studio) As films become more closely linked
to specific names, they start to feel more like works of art rather than DVDs
to keep the kids happy in the back seat. **With a bigger Best Pic pool, there
is no longer a need to push animators into a corner with this useless,
offensive award. **</p>

<h3 id="fix-the-foreign-language-film"><strong>Fix the Foreign Language Film</strong></h3>

<p>Over the years the essence of the Foreign Language film seems to have been
lost. Given out officially since 1956, the award is meant to showcase films
that do not open in the U.S. during their initial run, thus bringing greater
attention to world cinema. The film must play in theaters overseas and be in a
language other than English. Fair enough, but technology keeps making the
world smaller, so we run into snags along the way.</p>

<p>Each nation must select an official film which AMPAS then whittles down to 5
nominees. There are obvious political issues that erupt in each country which
the Academy can neither control nor anticipate, but there are rules that could
be changed to allow more films into the fold.For films to be eligible they
must be primarily in the language of the country of origin. In 2008,
<em>Beaufort</em> was Israel’s official selection, though a controversy brewed over
another favorite from that country, <em>Bikur Ha-Tizmoret (The Band’s Visit)</em>,
which is in English, Hebrew and Arabic. Rumors swirled that <em>Beaufort’s</em>
producers brought to the selection committee’s attention the exact length of
spoken English in <em>The Band’s Visit</em>, which happened to be too long for
eligibility, thus securing a spot for the nod. The latter film, which was
critically well-received the world over, should have been eligible regardless.
Though the outdated rules AMPAS has set up forbid it, culturally speaking it
is a film that should have every right to compete on behalf of its nation.</p>

<p>Also, for some unknown reason, a film can be nominated both for Best Foreign
Language Film and Best Picture like Roberto Benigni’s <em>La vita è bella (Life
is Beautiful)</em> was in 1998. This is particularly vexing considering the fact
that if, say, a documentary film wants to try for the top award, the producers
must pull it from the Best Documentary running. Why is it that this award can
have it both ways yet other categories must make some tough choices? I think
it’s pretty clear that the rules in general need to be revamped from the
ground up.</p>

<h3 id="eliminate-redundant-nominees">Eliminate Redundant Nominees</h3>

<p>It is an incredible honor for anyone to be nominated for an Oscar, so to be
nominated twice in the same category would be an even greater honor, right?
Well, if you ask Steven Soderbergh, who won Best Director for <em>Traffic</em> in
2001 while he was also nominated for <em>Erin Brockovich</em>, yes, it is pretty
great. But ask Roger Deakins, a cinematographer who has racked up an
incredible 8 nominations in his career, two for Best Cinematography in 2008
(<em>No Country for Old Men, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward
Robert Ford</em>) and you might get a different answer. Mr. Deakins has never
taken home gold, and in 2008 the theory is that he outdid himself. If voters
who would support his work wanted to vote for him, they split their vote in
two different places making it actually that much more difficult for him to
win.</p>

<p>That same year, songwriters Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz racked up 3
nominations for songs they wrote for Disney’s <em>Enchanted</em>. There was only one
other film with a song in the running, (<em>August Rush)</em> <em>Once</em>, and it went
home the victor. Again, the vote was probably split between all three of the
artists’ songs.</p>

<p>Now, I realize that the actual quality of a given piece plays a huge part in
the actual choice of an actual winner. Still, nominees should compete against
each other, not themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/transformers_2_shia_labeouf.jpg" alt="Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Still" /><em>As my
<a href="https://twitter.com/poritsky/status/2319109811">twitter</a> followers may know,
I dragged my bones to the IMAX at 2 am last Wednesday to check out
_Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.</em> It has taken me longer than usual to
sit down and review the film mainly because the airwaves are clouded by so
much of the same everywhere. In an effort to speed things along and get the
candler blog back on track, I have decided to simply offer up my opinion on
the film in short bullet points. Is this a cop out? Yes. Will you forgive me?
I hope! _</p>

<p><em>Is _Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</em> a good film?_</p>

<p>In short, no. However, it is not the worst film ever. I would say it beats out
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/08/review-x
-men-origins-wolverine/"><em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em></a> for overall watchability. The plot is almost non-
existent and clunky at it’s most coherent points. Though the film may have
generated an incredible amount of box office receipts, it does not stand out
as a great action film to say the least. There are too many characters and the
camera is always moving in a manner that makes it impossible to focus on
anything. But don’t worry, there is a choice soundtrack to ground your
auditory senses at least.</p>

<p><em>Are there any memorable performances in the film?</em></p>

<p>Shia LaBeouf proves once again why he deserves the spotlight in studio
tentpoles. He is not a great action hero but he has an incredible ability to
ease any scene. His comic timing timing is impeccable, and there is no off
switch for the sincere laughs he brings. Hand him lemons and he manages to
make lemonade time and time again. Megan Fox almost becomes more than a pretty
face (read: tuchus), but the script doesn’t give her much chance. John
Turturro is a little blander than he was the last go-around, but that can be
said across the boards in this sequel.</p>

<p><em>Are the characters of Skids and Mudflap racist?</em></p>

<p>Absolutely, but that’s the wrong question to ask. The internet is abuzz with
talk of these two “jive-talking” characters.  Why? Because it is easy to make
a story out of this issue. The characters are absolutely stereotypes of urban
street culture who never do much of anything in the film besides talk. Should
you be offended? Hell yes. Is this new? Absolutely not, and I’m not saying
this just hearkens back to D.W. Griffith days. Black characters are still
maligned to a great extent in Hollywood films, look at, well look at pretty
much anything. It seems that the easy target of a summer blockbuster <em>and</em>
Michael Bay have simply boiled these emotions over. Great! But to all you
writers out there who squawked about this last week, I hope you keep the convo
up up in the future and don’t just drop race issues like any other meme.</p>

<p><em>Is it worth seeing this movie on the IMAX?</em></p>

<p>Yes. Just like last summer’s <a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/2008/08/07/review-the-dark-knight/"><em>The Dark
Knight</em></a>,
<em>Revenge</em> features scenes captured on actual IMAX 65mm film. The metallic bots
rendered out at that size look gorgeous so it is definitely worth a peek. As
with any 35mm to IMAX blowup, you are actually losing picture quality for more
than 90% of the film, but at least it will sound amazing in that big ass
theater! Also, of the two IMAX specific scenes in the film, neither of them
are actually cut 100% IMAX. Believe it or not, while you’re watching these
expansive scenes unfold, suddenly there will be 35mm film inter-cut at a
different aspect ratio. This is most offensive when the shot that is cut in is
fully animation and lasts all of 4 seconds at most. What the hell?! At $200+
million you couldn’t afford to keep the film in one aspect ratio at a time!?
Which brings us to the final question…</p>

<p><em>Is Michael Bay the worst filmmaker/person ever?</em></p>

<p>Nah, we’ll keep him. His main issue is that he has no regard for cinema. Mr.
Bay really just goes ahead and does pretty much whatever he wants. If he sat
down and asked himself some very simple questions about whatever film he is
making, I imagine his answers would look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it a good film? Who cares, it’s entertaining. Am I maybe being a little
racist? Nah, I’m not a racist, I have black friends. What will people say
about my film in 10 years? It made a lot of money. Does my film have a
message? Why would it need one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, I honestly believe that he learned all he needed to a long time ago
with <em>The Rock</em>, his best film to date. After that he has been convinced that
he can show up and make a great film. I think if he retracted into a smaller
action film, maybe a <em>Bad Boys 3</em>, he would find a way to make some sense of
it. With all of this noise and hubbub surrounding the Transformers franchise,
you get what you pay for: a lot of noise and hubbub.</p>
