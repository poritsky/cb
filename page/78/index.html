melodrama nor the exploitive horrors that are common in domestic abuse
thrillers, but a more realistic drafting of the possibilities of subtle daily
domestic violence. As a first feature, <em>1 in 3</em> is prone to raw craft, but it
is the passion and careful intention of the film’s depiction of fear in
domestic violence that allows the film to convey its message of strength and
validate social advocacy.</p>

<p>An initial courtroom scene between Sydell, social service advocate, and her
domestic violence client Angie defines several key concepts behind the film.
As the judge hears another case, Sydell and Angie share a private dialogue
through the passing of paper and pen. What Angie reveals is a fear of her
abusive husband despite the safety of legal decisions. Though she may
recognize the authority of the legal procedures, the fact remains that Angie’s
voice is denied and the ramifications of this moment extend beyond the
courtroom of rules. Angie’s husband not only proves the limits of legal
restrictions when he pulls out a gun in a later scene, but also ignites the
recognition of the realities behind Sydell’s job: a legal resolution does not
stop the possibilities of violence, and perhaps forces an unintended silence
of victims. While this sequence of events results in dramatic violence at the
hands of a male aggressor and gunplay, the film reveals the forms of violence
only begin with the physical and extend into one’s own complicity when fears
become the driving force of daily decisions.</p>

<p>Sydell and Angie are two of three women the film follows, and upper-class
married Ophelia is the third. While Sydell confronts issues with intelligent
contemplation and smart retort, Ophelia is a character of action. Battle
preparations of hidden car keys and pill bottles anticipate her husband’s
violent outbursts, just as they also reveal her acceptance of this violence as
habit. Natasha Barron’s articulate performance of subtle gesture and hidden
thought provide a believable character who’s torn between the love of her
family and the painful relationship she’s had to endure. While it is Barron’s
command as an actress that allows for a believable confrontation between the
two strong characters Ophelia and Sydell, Davis has not drafted enough scenes
of Ophelia’s struggle between the love for a husband when he is good and the
horror of an abuser when he is bad. Such scenes would heighten and clarify the
reasons behind the difficulty of leaving a spouse, especially if they are an
abuser.</p>

<p>All shortcomings aside, the strength of the film is how Davis conveys the
complicity that one’s own fear plays in the role of victim in any problematic
relationship. While Sydell does not have a history of domestic violence, she
is able to strongly advocate for the validity of a victim’s emotions as well
as support their acceptance of violence in their own lives – both key
necessities of domestic violence advocates. Though Sydell is strong in her
beliefs, only once Ophelia questions her authority in group therapy does
Sydell appear to be hypocritical. Sydell’s own fears inhibit her decision
making process when it comes to letting her guard down when finding a mate. As
Sydell comes to recognize her internalization of fear has blocked her ability
to find happiness, the viewer is able to identify Sydell as struggling with
the same inhibitions Ophelia does when asked to verbally recognize her own
abuse. These two women suddenly share a similar struggle of fear’s powerful
grasp over one’s identity, and close the bridge between Ophelia’s question of
authority and Sydell’s limited domestic violence memory. This conflicted
depiction of Sydell breaks down the often either/or cinematic depiction of the
social worker as an overly emotional bleeding heart or the cold-hearted lover
of government red-tape. This bridge between Sydell and Ophelia should
hopefully instill a comfort for those victims who question the sympathy of
their advocates, suggesting they too are overtaken by the fragile nature of
one’s fear and guilt.</p>

content/uploads/2010/06/matt-hoffman-flys-
590x418-300x212.jpg" alt="The Birth of Big Air Still" /></a>Although the dominance of ESPN over the concept
of this documentary is so powerful, <em>Jackass</em> director Jeff Tremaine and
editor Seth Casriel found ways to both defy and utilize the network’s clean
format and structure while also presenting some incredible historical footage
that places Matt Hoffman’s BMX footage into new light, and perhaps brings us
the closest to the mortality of Hoffman’s unique biking style.</p>

<p>One of the most unique kinds of video work is hardcore bike and skate videos,
one of my favorite genre of filmmaking. Such works impart a true love of a
craft (in this case, biking) and often become overlooked by those who don’t
share the same interest, nor know exactly at what it is they’re looking when
such footage is presented to them without context. Yet, there is little that
rivals such work in its ability to capture the harsh truths and intense
passion of any particular, and fleeting, “moment”. While Tremaine and Casriel
are able to incorporate such amazing footage, it is the way in which they are
able to craft the reasons for such footage’s appeal that makes this
documentary shine beyond a possibly rigid talking-head format.</p>

<p>Matt Hoffman, the BMX mad-man/sports star upon who’s career story the
documentary focuses, is someone who defines the documentary’s structure in his
proclamation that with any successful highs comes the possibilities of a hard
landing. As soon as we’re introduced to this philosophy, we find some amazing
trick jumps through some very incredibly captured documentation. The stunts
become entrancing, and the ability to predict the physical outcome becomes
tantamount in these moments. Often when shots are about to display a landing
we cut to another successful jump. The implicit feeling of achievement,
success, and unhindered possibilities are at the forefront of the
documentary’s first third. Only once we feel a sense of Hoffman’s
invincibility are we introduced to the falls that come with these jumps, and
with each clip we find more and more footage depicts a hand land or crash.
While this footage seems more of the harsh reality of physics, it is also an
expected element of any great bike video. The successful ramp slides and jumps
are contrasted with the real moments of impending mortality, suddenly it’s
clear what Hoffman is attempting to escape –not necessarily his own historical
records, nor even the limits of his own sport: it is feeling of freedom from
the pain and suffrage that comes in a moment after the fall.</p>

<p>This incredible footage also becomes the expected truth through Hoffman’s
actual practice footage, footage that was before publicly unseen. This footage
brings forth an intimacy not only with Hoffman’s personal practice routine,
but with the real possibility of pain in a crash or fall. With the clean and
smooth footage of ESPN coverage, or a news crew documentation, comes the
safety of a sport’s completion. There’s always the possibility of another take
or immediate medical assistance at an event at which participants have spent
months practicing. Stripped of these safeties, these practice videos get us so
close to the moments of possible failure that Hoffman’s mortality becomes our
own –will he make the jump when he’s still yet figuring out the trick? Such
incredible moments provide for a real connection that goes beyond ESPN
historical footage. These moments are such a treasure for such a notable
figure.</p>

<p>As well as his practice footage, we are given a moment-by-moment account
surrounding one of Hoffman’s most painful landings that results in extreme
physical aftershock from an attempt to jump a thirty-foot ramp before
television crews in the early 2000s. The strict ESPN structure and format are
suddenly broken down in a moment so clearly captured that all talking heads
are forgotten, and all we are left with are the real fears of Hoffman’s life,
perhaps the closest we’ll possibly come to grasping the real fears that occur
within the head of a biker after the height of a world record jump.</p>

<p>Tremaine has crafted together many great interviews, but what contrasts these
clean, and almost overly sterile moments, are some amazingly personal footage
and moments that define not only the highs of a careers, but the pains that
comes with these humanizing lows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t make much secret about being an avid reader of the New York Times
movie reviews. Though my blogging brethren (and <a href="http://www.askoxford
.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/brethren?view=uk">sistren</a>) offer prime insight, I
came of age as a critic reading A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, oscillating
between loving and hating them as my allegiances and beliefs have grown over
the years. This week, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/movies/06dargis.html">Manohla added to the
conversation</a>
surrounding <em>Sex and the City 2</em>, which was reviewed for the Times by Mr.
Scott. We rarely get to see the opinion of both critics save for year-end
roundups, so this is an extra treat so close to release.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen <em>SATC2</em> yet, so one really ought to take my thoughts with a
grain of salt. I’ve enjoyed the smattering of episodes of the series that I’ve
seen and I found the first film funny, if grating. New York on film holds a
place dear to my heart. It seems even its most gifted celluloid sculptors have
had trouble reproducing it in the last decade (I’m talking to you, Woody
Allen). The dialogue around this latest fantasia, as Ms. Dargis points out, is
largely related to questions of ethnocentricity and racial sensitivities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To borrow a tactic from the TV show, which invariably featured Carrie posing
the week’s Big Question to her readers: Was “Sex” actually 50 percent worse
the second time around? Not from where I was seated, though I happily concede
that the sequel is about as bad as the original. They’re just lousy in
different ways. The new sex puns (“Lawrence of my labia”) are as wince
inducing as the old, and Mr. King’s direction remains strictly small screen.
What has changed are the locations: in the first film, the friends visit
Mexico (funny!), but this time, they yuk it up in the Middle East (not
funny!). But what has really changed? The characters, the critics, the
context: how quickly yesterday’s pleasure can pop, just like an economic
bubble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to agree with her. Like Michael Bay’s <em>Transformers 2</em> before it, this
film makes the perfect target for any number of derisions. Mexico is funny
because we don’t mind getting a little racist when it comes to our neighbors
to the south. When it comes to the Middle East, we tread softly because of
national tensions and, honestly, personal fears. So I’ll give Manohla, and
this film, that much.</p>

<p>Where I get annoyed, however, is in her closing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This and other scenes of the women with Muslims are often awkward, though
that’s partly a function of Mr. King’s direction. Yet there’s also something
touching about a few of these encounters, as when the women wonder how you eat
fries when you’re wearing a veil, a question that strikes me as an
uncharacteristically honest admission of difference in a mainstream American
movie. Too bad the women weren’t guys and went to Las Vegas, where they could
have indulged in the kind of critically sanctioned masculine political
incorrectness that made “The Hangover” such a darling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-
hangover/">I did not like </a><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-
hangover/">The Hangover</a></em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/07/review-the-
hangover/"> all that much</a>, and I completely agree with her sentiment that masculine stupidity
often goes unquestioned onscreen. However, that doesn’t exactly make for much
of an excuse. The first <em>Sex and the City</em> film was lauded for its ability to
rake in millions while boasting a cast of female leads, a rarity in this
business. The same goes for the show, though it should be noted that today
(not in 1998 when the show first aired) women are in control of television
programming in a big way. Phenomena like <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> and <em>Desperate
Housewives</em> are a testament to this shift.</p>

<p>Regardless, does the status of Carrie and pals offer leeway on their level of
political correctness? For my part, no. Nor should it let <em>The Hangover</em> guys
off the hook, but the difference there seems to be that that film knew exactly
what it wanted to be. If <em>SATC2</em> actually is a bad film, then hopefully it is
a bad film on merit alone. We should not forget that we now live in a world
where a woman has won an Oscar for Best Director, and for a film with no
female leads. I think it is short sighted to chalk negative reactions up to
critical sexism.</p>

<p>But I haven’t seen the film and I’m a dude, so what do I know?</p>

/boxeeondroid-195x300.png" alt="Boxee on Android" /></a>Last week, Google announced a new
product called <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">GoogleTV</a>, a software platform that
lets you watch video from the web on your big shiny television in the living
room. This is something I’ve been doing since late 2008 by plugging my laptop
into my TV and launching <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a>, a free piece of
software that does almost exactly what GoogleTV purports to do. This past
February I had a <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/02/24/candlercast-9-thinking-out-of-
the-boxee-with-andrew-kippen/">great chat with Andrew Kippen of
Boxee</a> about their software and the future of media
delivery. As I digested Google’s announcement, I couldn’t help but wonder what
Boxee was thinking about this. So I emailed Andrew, and this is what he had to
say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We obviously followed the [GoogleTV] announcement and the demo. We think
that it would be great to see an open OS such as Android gain market share in
the living room. It would enable users to download Boxee on their TV (we will
be building an Android-based App) and start using it without the hassle of
connecting their computer to the TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have somewhat of a different view of browsing the web on TV. While it was
a big part of the Google Demo we believe browsing the web as-is makes more
sense on laptops and mobile devices (due to their personal nature, the screen
size and the input device) than it does on TV. We look forward to playing with
the TV and working with them to bringing Boxee to Android devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to make sure I read that correctly. I’ve heard they are working on an
Android remote app similar to the one they have on the iPhone, but this sounds
like something different:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You read correctly.  if there’s a TV platform running on TVs that can
deliver a great Boxee experience then we want to be there. <strong>That</strong>**
<strong>**means</strong>** <strong>**we’re</strong>** <strong>**looking</strong>** <strong>**at</strong>** <strong>**developing</strong>**
<strong>**an</strong>** <strong>**Android</strong>** <strong>**App</strong>** <strong>**version</strong>** <strong>**of</strong>**
<strong>**Boxee</strong>** <strong>**for</strong>** <strong>**the</strong>** <strong>**upcoming</strong>** <strong>**Google</strong>**
<strong>**TV</strong><strong>.</strong> [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa. That’s kind of a big surprise, and an exciting one for both consumers
and content makers. Google announced partnerships with Dish, Sony, Adobe,
Logitech, Intel and Best Buy, so it may seem as though Boxee is facing an
insurmountable foe. However it is important to remember the company’s history.
The software gained prominence once it found its way onto the AppleTV, which
at first was a questionable install (it is still only supported by a third
party). Boxee essentially beat Apple, one of the most powerful and litigious
tech companies around, at its own game by bringing internet video to the
television set. Andrew’s assurance that they will bring the software to the
Android platform is an indication that history will repeat itself. Boxee will
be anywhere where software can run and consumers will be able to choose how
they want to view content. Now that I know that, I am far more excited for
this new platform.</p>

Logo)</p>

content/uploads/2010/04/tesuothebulletman-
300x182.jpg" alt="Tesuo: The Bullet Man Still" /></a>In preparation for this year’s
Tribeca Film Festival, I cozied up with a copy of <em>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</em>,
director Shinya Tsukamoto’s 1989 sci-fi mindfuck. The film holds its own as a
low budget visual masterpiece, sporting only a handful of dialogue, impressive
prosthetics and a phenomenal, pounding soundtrack. With the third film in the
series, <em>Tetsuo: The Bullet Man</em>, Tsukamoto keeps the material anything but
stale, but his form has suffered gravely over the years. While the film’s
concept is solid (man turns into gun) there is far too much time wasted on
narrative, an odd complaint to say the least.</p>

<p>In general, I deride films for poor narrative structure (a festival disease,
if you ask me), but the thing about the original <em>Tetsuo</em> is that the story is
told so vividly through the visuals, that things like character and plot
development rightfully fall to the wayside. Fantastic, horrific events just
occur in front of you, inexplicably. There was an arc, but it manifested
itself in the amount of iron that sprung out of the hero’s body.</p>

<p><em>Tetsuo: The Bullet Man</em> gets off to a clean start. Anthony, our hero, is
obviously going through some kind of mechanical change. After the death of his
son, he turns into a gun, meaning if you get him angry enough, rounds of
bullets shoot out of his chest. Since assassins are chasing him, he gets angry
a lot, so he turns into an even bigger gun. The “bullet man” costume is nice.
It is all mechanical, with only a few (possibly) digital flourishes towards
the end of the film. It’s impossible to explain what the iron and brimstone
costume actually looks like, but it’s quite wonderful.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem. This film is mired in back story, for no reason! It truly
is enough to know that Anthony is slowly turning into a monster, but we spend
more than half the film building up his history. Why is he turning into a gun?
He’s basically an android love child…blah blah blah. There is a ridiculous
amount of time spent on this, leaving us with only about twenty decent minutes
of movie. Now it’s true that those minutes are pretty great, but the remainder
is completely boring.</p>

<p>All that being said, <em>Tetsuo: The Bullet Man</em> does stand as a pretty decent
example of what a low budget sci-fi looks like in 2010. Tsukamoto makes
excellent use of a rolling video shutter and snap zooms, giving us a frenetic
look that couldn’t exist a decade ago. There is no questions that he took
great strides to push his limits, but the slow and confused narrative makes it
a tough 74 minutes to sit through. If you are a <em>Tetsuo</em> fan, you’ll still
fine something to love nonetheless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to jot down a few quick thoughts on Todd McCarthy’s recent
announcement that he is <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/welcome_todd_mccarthy/">joining the indieWIRE blog
network</a>. As you may
recall, <a href="http://blogs.indiew
ire.com/thompsononhollywood/2010/03/08/variety_lays_off_its_lifes_blood_critic
s_mccarthy_and_rooney/">Todd lost his job as Variety’s chief film critic</a> the day after the Oscars this year. As a result, the
press exploded with opinions on the death of film criticism, with the usual
culprit being the online blogger/critic. Now, Todd has found a home online,
the very land that supposedly caused his undoing.</p>

<p>Bet you idiots feel pretty stupid now.</p>

<p>There really is no better fit for Mr. McCarthy than indieWIRE, a network that
has defined and redefined the online cinema magazine/trade publication time
and time again. The real loser here is Variety, who has taken nearly every
misstep possible in the age of internet journalism. Their pay wall will
eventually be their undoing, but by literally handing their golden boy to the
free competition, Variety seems to have put the nail in their own coffin.</p>

<p>Mainly, I would like to say welcome, Todd; the ‘net is happy to have you. I
have no doubt that you will enjoy an online career as exciting as <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/">Roger
Ebert</a> or <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/">David
Bordwell</a>. Film journalism, and especially
criticism, is not dead but alive and well online. If ever we see a weakening
in the art of film writing, we can only blame ourselves. The internet has
nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>(If you’ve been wondering where I am, all my film writing is at <a href="http://candlerblog.com">the candler
blog</a>, but you can also see my work peppered on
<a href="http://guru.greencine.com">Greencine Guru</a>, <a href="http://www.heebmagazine.com">Heeb

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The British film <em>The Infidel</em> just reached American shores this week at the
Tribeca Film Festival here in New York City. The irreverent comedy is about a
Muslim who learns he is adopted and his parents are in fact Jewish. What
ensues is a delightful comedy of errors that delves into the murkier depths of
religious and ethnic stereotypes. You can read my full review <a href="http://www.heebmagazine.com/chosen-film-_the-infidel_/">over at Heeb
Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>I was able to get some face time with four people connected to the film. Josh
Appignanesi is the film’s director and David Baddiel wrote the script. The two
offered up some deadpan wisdom on the weighty subject their film deals with.
The bulk of my questions (as you’ll hear) focus on reactions to the film and
whether or not it is controversial. Both Baddiel and Appignanesi are
passionate about their creative choices and the power of comedy in the most
uncomfortable of social conversations. They say it better, so definitely check
it out.</p>

<p>Omid Djalili and Richard Schiff, the film’s stars, are similarly serious when
it comes to discussing <em>The Infidel</em>. Schiff, who is most well known in the
states for his role as Toby Ziegler on <em>The West Wing</em>, takes particular
offense at having any of his roles, including that of Lenny in <em>The Infidel</em>,
labeled as stereotypically Jewish. The two exhude a comic energy that made it
difficult for me to keep a straight face while chatting them up. Especially at
the end of our talk, the two go off on the provenance of a few racial
epithets. It is quite hilarious.</p>

<p>As always, I’ve said too much. Just click play already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/04/spork_still.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04
/spork_still-300x176.jpg" alt="Spork Still" /></a>Much like the film’s protagonist,
<em>Spork</em> is a movie with a serious identity crisis. A veritable mashup of
<em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> and <em>Strictly Ballroom</em>, director J.B. Ghuman, Jr. riffs
on style but forgets to add the substance in this story a frizzy haired
hermaphrodite who comes of age on the dance floor. It’s not quite a musical, a
dance film or a hipster treasure trove, but instead a watered down version of
all three at once.</p>

<p>Spork (Savannah Stehlin), so nicknamed because she isn’t quite a spoon or a
fork (get it?), lives in a trailer park with her older brother. Her father
left long ago and her mother is buried in the yard. Her best pal, Tootsie Roll
(Sydney Park), lives in the trailer next door. Tootsie’s got a big mouth and
the dance moves to back it up, but she rolls with a crowd of fly girls, which
leaves Spork on her own once they get to school.</p>

<p>Betsy Byotch (Rachel G. Fox ), pronounced bee-otch, a blonde haired little
snoot who worships Britney Spears, runs a clique of white girls whose arch
enemies are Tootsie’s group of black girls. The racism and sexism that is
manifested into childish taunting is accurate, if intentionally over the top
in this film. When Byotch calls Tootsie “colored” it sounds as natural as if
she had chosen a tamer, more common epithet, but she wears her racism on her
sleeve. Byotch hates black people…and hermaphrodites…for some reason.</p>

<p>Much of the film’s visual flair seems to come from a fantasia of the 1980s; of
the bits from that era we look upon nostalgically as “cool”. Paper 3D glasses?
Very cool. Splatter pants? Way hip. Over-moussed bangs? You betcha! Part of
the problem is that the film doesn’t necessarily take place in the 1980s as
there are modern references peppered throughout. I’m all for anachronisms, but
this creative choice is a lot to swallow without any kind of emotional
justification. I asked myself the whole time “How does this move our story
forward?” Without an answer, the only explanation I could come up with is that
J.B. Ghuman has a deep nostalgia for the 1980s and is banking that the rest of
us do too.</p>

<p>I would prescribe a healthy dose of Dennis Potter to Mr. Ghuman. The British
television writer became a master of using what he called “cheap” music in
series like “The Singing Detective” and “Pennies from Heaven”. Thematically,
<em>Spork</em> seems like it might share more with these pieces than the over-
stylized works this film has been culled from. Potter always found a way to
bring recognizable tunes into the story in a manner that (I hate to harp on
this) moved the story forward. Instead, we are just mired in the perceived
“coolness” of this music as we wait for the next scene to pick up.</p>

<p>I could imagine reading the script for <em>Spork</em> and seeing its merit. The main
character has an interesting back story and the simplicity of junior high
level conflicts (winning a dance-off really is the most important thing in the
world) certainly make for a nice canvas. Unfortunately, the waters have been
muddied by overly glitzy white noise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/04/Brooklyn-Street-Art-Exit-Through-The-Giftshop-Banksy-
Still-Jan2010.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/04/Brooklyn-Street-Art-Exit-Through-The-Giftshop-Banksy-
Still-Jan2010-300x168.jpg" alt="Banksy in his Exit Through the Gift Shop" /></a>Ever since its dubious premiere at Sundance earlier this
year, Banksy’s <em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em> has exploded with discussion about
its validity. Is it a real documentary, or is it staged? Is Banksy one person,
or a collective? Is Thierry Guetta, the film’s pudgy protagonist, a diehard
street art sidekick or a figment of Banksy’s twisted imagination? The truth is
that it doesn’t really matter all that much either way. It’s a solid
documentary whose mysterious existence only add to the fun.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Banksy is an irreverent street artist whose work has
been celebrated (and in some cases, reviled) the world over. From graffiti
stencils to off-the-wall sculptures to painted elephants, there is basically
nothing that he won’t try. Add to that list filmmaking, or so we assume.
Though <em>Exit</em> has a clear and proper title, in discussion most people will
refer to it as “the Banksy film”, which is interesting because his credit
reads, somewhat nebulously, “A Banksy Film”. That he appears on camera early
on, be-shrouded and his voice modulated, as more of a subject than an auteur
is our first sign that something may be amiss.</p>

<p>Banksy tells us that this is a film about Thierry, a Los Angeles Frenchman who
had the nasty habit of filming everything around him. The story goes that once
Thierry started filming his cousin the artist known as Invader, he began
earning his stripes enough to be considered something of a documentarian even
though he never had anything to show for all of his adventures. After an awful
cut of his supposed documentary is shown to Banksy, the artist asks to take a
crack at cutting the footage together into something workable. The film we
see, supposedly, is the result of that handoff.</p>

<p>Thierry goes on to host his own art show as Mister Brainwash, an invented
persona. It is a wild success even though his work is basically stolen from
Banksy, Warhol and other artists. The public, high on hype, didn’t seem to
care as Thierry sold over a million dollars worth of art when the show opened.
Overnight, he became a success in the public’s eye, a fact which Banksy
apologizes for unleashing on the world.</p>

<p>But is it real? If it isn’t, then the lengths that many people had to go to to
pull this off were extraordinary. The truth is that the more we speculate on
the validity of the film, the more valid it becomes. If it is a hoax, then it
is a very real and very clever hoax that would outpace anything Andy Kaufman
ever attempted. Banksy’s street art has the ability to make the ordinary
extraordinary. A telephone booth becomes a lounging character in his world; so
too does this widely released film become an interactive piece that promotes
involved discussion when the audience goes home.</p>

<p>If we take all of that away, however, and assume that it is all a true tale,
then it is in fact a very ordinary documentary. It has sit-down interviews,
cheeky narration from the actor, Rhys Ifans, and a catchy soundtrack that
audiences of all ages should be able to enjoy. There aren’t too many chances
being taken here cinematically, but I can understand why. Street art, by its
very nature, is accessible; you have no choice but to encounter it. By making
an accessible film, Banksy will be able to get most audiences to jibe with his
narrative before flipping the story over on them. By the time the “what is
art?” question comes up, you have grown so close to Thierry that you feel
almost betrayed when he becomes a hack. It is very slick the way in which the
wool is pulled over our eyes.</p>

<p>Or else it is all fake. Which means it isn’t even a documentary. What are
documentaries? And around we go.</p>

<p>The only film you don’t get in this deal is the finest piece of Americana we
have. The greatest American movie ever made is the only disc left out of this,
but you probably already own it anyway. Christopher Nolan’s masterpiece, <em>The
Dark Knight</em>, will not be included in this deal because Amazon assumes every
American already got is as a gift last hanukkah.</p>
