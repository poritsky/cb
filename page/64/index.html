  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of you who read this site may not know the ins and outs of Jewish publishing. Frankly, neither do I, but, as a writer and editor at <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/author/Poritsky">Heeb</a>, I’m close enough to the metal that I can set the stage for you.</p>

<p>Tablet Magazine is a wonderful online project with a talented staff and a formidable stable of guest writers. It’s <em>The New Yorker</em> of the Jewish publishing world. Jewcy is a youth-centric blog that was acquired by JDub Records, the label that gave the world Matisyahu, in 2009. JDub also partnered with Tablet in late 2009 but <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/07/12/3088520/innovative-new-jewish-music-nonprofit-jdub-is-closing">folded</a> earlier this year. Yesterday it was announced that the seemingly homeless Jewcy will now be published by Tablet.</p>

<p>Mazel tov!</p>

<p>All would be well and good if not for a slight by Tablet’s intrepid blogger, Marc Tracy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Here he is <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/83280/please-welcome-jewcy-to-tablet/">welcoming Jewcy</a> into his family:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five years ago today, Jewcy was born. Since then, the online-only Jewish magazine that many of you probably already read has gone through several evolutions and changes of management, with, to my reading, one constant: a dedication to engaging young Jews who may not think of themselves as the likeliest readers of a Jewish magazine, and doing so by winking at the conventions of what a Jewish magazine should be without undermining those conventions to the point of standing for nothing at all. (Cough.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his original post, the word cough was linked to Heeb’s main page. Unprovoked, he took the opportunity to winkingly call Heeb out for, if I’m following this correctly, undermining the conventions of a Jewish magazine “to the point of standing for nothing at all.” The joke, by my read, goes past the point of rib-poking. It’s a mean jab that seems out of place in an otherwise meaningful post. I can take it, but I can volley back, nu?</p>

<p>The first thing worth noting is that Heeb predates all the other publications involved here. Perhaps it’s ancient history, but when I hear the words “conventions of a Jewish magazine” my mind immediately goes to Heeb. Before I was a writer I was a reader, and no Jewish publication, not a one, went as far into the mainstream as Heeb did. It was revolutionary. Ultimately, Jewcy and Tablet are taking the road that Heeb paved a decade ago.</p>

<p>But yes, that <em>is</em> ancient history. Things have changed in our little world. Jewcy rose to prominence a few years back (though they’ve been dropping consistently for a year) and Tablet is now one of the dominant forces online. That’s okay, there’s room for a lot of voices, but to suggest that Heeb stands for “nothing at all” is patently false. Our goals are simply different.</p>

<p>We have no interest in seeing a return on our investment by way of Jewish marriages, Jewish babies, Jewish love for Israel or any of the other “goals” that a Jewish magazine <em>could</em> stand for. We don’t prescribe what Jewish life should be. All we aim to do is provide thought provoking writing about the Jewish experience in relation to whatever else is happening in the world. It can be funny, it can be offensive, it can be whatever we want. Former publisher Josh Neuman put it best when we <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/so-much-for-controlling-the-media">suspended print last summer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Heeb Magazine</em> has never been about making Jewish “cool.” What we are big believers in, however, is making Jewish fun. We believe that in a world in which Jewish periodicals outdo themselves in attempting to highlight just how endangered Jews are, there should be one Jewish media outlet that actually makes its readers smile.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t have an agenda, a fact that has hurt us over the years. Damn near killed us, actually. Heeb is viewed as a double-edged sword in the Jewish publishing world. We have the young, unaffiliated audience that none of the other sites can seem to pin down, but we don’t conform to the standards of a hip synagogue newsletter. We take chances and, every so often, we go too far. Sometimes, that makes Jews look bad. But hey, so does tossing an editorial swipe into what amounts to a press release.</p>

<p>Marc, we can talk until we’re blue in the face about what role Heeb should play, what it stands for, what Jewcy stands for, etc. We can argue which site has better content and which reaches what audience. There’s no point though. You’re one of the hardest working writers online and one of my favorite to read to boot. I can’t wrap my head around how many words you get right every single day and I applaud you for it. But this one word, this “cough,” was wrong and you know it. Dick move.</p>

<p>So let’s see how things go for Jewcy under Tablet. Can’t wait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m really enjoying using Hog Bay Software’s <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom 3.0</a> which launched one week ago. One of the new features is the ability to configure multiple themes and share them with other users. I certainly love fiddling with my many (multitudinous, countless, umpteen, etc.) text editors, so of course the first thing I did was go and look for available themes online. Alas, none were to be found, so I made some of my own and I’d like to share them with you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m not sure what the party was for, but I distinctly remember finding myself
at the house of a screenwriter who lived in my area growing up. It was one of
those fancy parties that kids probably shouldn’t be brought along to but are
anyway. The owner split his time between coasts, wheeling and dealing in
Hollywood while finding a place to lay his hat in his suburban Philadelphia
manse.</p>

<p>There was never a time in my life that I didn’t want to work in movies. My
parents always encouraged and broadcast my aspirations. Perhaps this was why I
was brought along; to forge a relationship with someone in the industry. In
fact, the screenwriter did his best to needle me in the right direction,
though, being just a kid, I didn’t always follow along.</p>

<p>The first thing this kindly writer showed off to me was a small cupboard near
the front door of his house. Inside was a stack of home entertainment gear.
Amplifiers, receivers, radios; wondrous gear with all manner of digital
displays and knobs and switches. This was the control room for an
entertainment system that was piped through the whole house. The dining room
had recessed speakers hidden below molding. There were speakers in nearly
every room, even some outside. Was this a sound system with a house built
around it, or the other way around?</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” he told me.</p>

<p>As I recall it, we then all gathered into the living room, adults and children
alike. The screenwriter flipped on his big-screen television (rear-projection,
of course). He wanted to share something special with us, a justification of
his aural investment. Naturally, he put on the Tyrannosaurus Rex scene from
<em>Jurassic Park</em>, that most famous sequence that starts with a rumble and ends
with a car mirror. I melted listening to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/fullcredits#sound_department">incredible, layered
soundtrack</a>
of the 1993 film.</p>

<p>I had forgotten about this party and this experience, but it all came rushing
back to me while reading <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7155904/the-cult-jurassic-park">Bryan Curtis’s
article</a>
about the cult of the dino franchise over at Grantland. Earlier in the week I
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/28/the-best-jurassic-park-
article-youll-read-this-week/">excerpted</a> his piece on this site, but it’s worth
reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Jurassic Park</em>, along with <em>The Abyss</em> (1989) and <em>Terminator 2</em> (1991),
were the stars of an amazing in-between period of summer-movie history. An
interesting couple of years between the Analogue Era and the Computer Era. We
were charging headfirst into the movie future, but we hadn’t quite left the
past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of what keeps me coming back to this particular film is nostalgia. I long
for the days when I was a boy whose socks could still get knocked off from
even the cheapest of tricks. But there is something more at play here.</p>

<p><em>Jurassic Park</em> and its antecedents were created for the big screen, but there was a certain magic to these films that allowed for them to be enjoyed brilliantly in the home. The technological advances of the 1990s were not limited to the theatrical experience. Where the “home theater” was once the playground of the über-rich, it has become an attainable reality for many. While prices haven’t hit rock bottom, the quality on the dollar you can get in your living room these days is far more reasonable than at any other point.<br />
When I hear film people talk about home viewing it is usually in the context
of the death of the theatrical experience. Usually, I’m inclined to agree; I
love nothing more than sitting in a darkened room with a bunch of strangers,
ogling whatever bogeymen or beauties slink across the screen. Still, I have
had many (many, many) great experiences on the couch, in bed, sprawled on a
floor or otherwise irregularly comfortable in my own or another’s home. Is
that so bad?</p>

<p>The memory described here is important because it was <em>special</em>. Sure, I only
watched a single scene and the purpose of the showing was more a braggadocious
muscle-flex than a celebration of cinema, but that didn’t stop me from
entering the world of the film. Spielberg’s film is enduring for a number of
reasons, all covered in Curtis’s excellent aforelinked article. One that he
skips, however, is its ability to suck you in even at home. The throw pillows
and microwaved popcorn disappear right from the film’s opening lines
(“Gatekeeper, step forward!”), allowing us to re-enter the deadly Isla Nublar
time and time again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both as a film festival programmer and as a university instructor, I have seen how, all too often, art direction (much like sound design!) is neglected in first films and student films. It’s easy to spot an amateur effort when gangsters are wearing Converse One-Stars (yep, I’ve actually seen this) or an <a href="http://trueslant.com/childers/2010/04/21/after-last-season-the- avant-garde-of-incompetence/">MRI machine is made out of cardboard</a> (<em>After Last Season</em>, anyone?).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As always, smart, useful information from one of my favorite filmmaking blogs. Great kicker at the end too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can make the story world credible or incredible, real or surreal. What’s more essential than that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More from Netflix’s shareholders letter from Monday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are various ways to evaluate the content of a video‐streaming service. One way is to focus purely on quantity, but that leads to the licensing of thousands of rarely watched titles. At the other extreme is concentrating solely on quality, as measured by the number of Oscar‐nominated or Emmy‐nominated titles we have. Instead, we think about the value of our content as a function of how much a given movie or TV series gets watched relative to other titles, for how long and by how many members. From that perspective, an Oscar‐nominated film may be of less value to Netflix subscribers than “Pawn Stars,” because subs are watching the reality show more than the Oscar‐nominated movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re definition of quality seems tacitly incorrect<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I’m willing to let it slide for now. What concerns me is the last part of of this paragraph regarding the value of Netflix’s content. There’s some circular reasoning going on at the company that is going to be a big problem for movie lovers as the company begins its “comeback.”</p>

<p>Netflix’s thought process in one sentence: People aren’t watching the movies we don’t have, therefore they don’t want to watch them.</p>

<p>This ideology stems from the fact that Netflix wants to be a television network that you get through the Internet instead of through a cable company. This is what led to their acquisition of David Fincher’s “House of Cards.” They explicitly state this intention elsewhere in the shareholders letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In episodic television, exclusives are also the norm. Netflix doesn’t license “Deadwood” from HBO because they see strategic value in keeping it exclusive. Netflix licenses “Mad Men” and “House of Cards” exclusively for much the same reason.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>They want to be in the original programming business; they want to follow the traditional network model. The only way they can figure out what to stream is to figure out what people are watching. Think of them as a channel, just like HBO, and you’ll start to see that the idea of Netflix as a gateway to every film available isn’t their business model anymore. The Netflix we once knew, that massive video rental store in the cloud, is gone. Or at least their executives wish it were.</p>

<p>The reason why it hurts to move into acceptance of this fact is that we all jumped aboard Netflix at the expense of our local video stores. Those little red envelopes destroyed the rental industry and there is blood on our hands. The war is over but the game has changed. Is this what we signed up for?</p>

<p>Netflix’s streaming library will, likely, never be analogous to its disc library. They’re getting out of the rental business they killed. What are the rest of us to do? I’m not sure yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There’s plenty to talk about in yesterday’s earnings letter from Netflix
(embedded below). The big number is 810,000, the amount of subscribers the
company lost last quarter. The shareholders’ letter is grim, repeatedly
referring to the recent customer exits as a “wave”. The language sounds as
though the company is bloodied and limping towards a revival. The starkest
line, in my view, is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the U.S., we’ll build back our brand the same way we built it in the
first place: no grand gestures, just amazing service day‐after‐day, for an
incredibly low price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Build back? This is not the language of, as is the company’s stated
aspiration, the “best streaming video subscription service on the planet.”
Their stock is plummeting, customers are exiting en masse and new competitors
are cropping up. Is this the end of Netflix? Not exactly.</p>

<p>There is a silver lining for the company. Domesitc revenues were up year-over-
year, as were their profit margins compared to the last quarter. The reason?
Less DVD shipments and, of course, the increased price of DVD-only plans. In
other words, their goal of being the best streaming service is meetable; DVD
and Blu-Ray seekers are marginal. If physical discs are your preferred method
of watching films, Netflix doesn’t care about you anymore.</p>

<p>I know this specifically <em>because</em> of this “no grand gestures” line. <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/10/qwikster-goeth/">I have
said before</a> CEO Reed
Hastings should have dealt with this issue more like Steve Jobs dealt with the
iPhone 4 “antenna-gate”; with a sweeping good-will deed (free bumpers!) that
made customers content enough to stick around. Though Netflix’s letter has a
plain-spokenness to it, there are also bits that sound delusional. The above
“incredibly low price” is a start, but elsewhere they complain of being
perceived as “greedy” in light of the price increase. The problem, Hastings
asserts, is that they did a poor job of explaining the pricing changes.</p>

<p>The letter is also dubious about the threat of competition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our $7.99 pricing is a full 20% lower than our nearest unlimited DVD‐by‐mail
competitor, and our service is better because we have more distribution
centers and, as such, faster delivery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are right about the leg-up on delivery speed, but the pricing comparison
with (I assume) Blockbuster is misleading. Yes, Blockbuster’s cheapest plan is
$9.99 a month, but it includes Blu-ray discs and videogames. The monthly price
for a single unlimited Blu-ray plan from Netflix? $9.99.</p>

<p>As a Netflix customer I have this much to say to Reed and CFO David Wells: you
are wrong. The time for chest-thumping bravado is over. We have had nothing
but excuses since you announced the price increase this summer. People aren’t
leaving because of a botched e-mail, it’s because you have proven that there
is a wide swath of customers you have no regard for. We are waiting for you to
make a move that says you are not abandoning lovers of physical discs, which
is to say lovers of library completeness and audiovisual quality. We are all
waiting for that grand gesture. Until we can’t wait anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Josef Adalian reports for New York Magazine’s <a href="http://nymag.com/daily
/entertainment/2011/10/nbc_will_try_to_bridge_the_dif.html">Vulture</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are American TV viewers ready to flock to a network sitcom that explores
questions of faith and ethnic identity, not to mention the often tense
relationship between Muslims and Jews? …Vulture hears the Peacock is working
with Avalon Television to develop a small-screen adaptation of last year’s
British comedy film <em>The Infidel</em>, which had its U.S. debut at Tribeca and
then played here largely via cable video on demand platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got to see the comedy when it came to New York for the Tribeca Film
Festival. Here’s what I had to <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/chosen-
film-_the-infidel_/5496">say at Heeb</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comedy should be confrontational, and <em>The Infidel</em> crosses the line more
than a few times. Still, the light style somehow keeps even touchy political
and religious conflicts breezy. Like <em>Bend it Like Beckham</em>, the moral is “Be
yourself, hey, but blend just a tad.” That wrap-up might be a little too
simple for some, but without it the film would devolve into the same old
arguments that both peoples have been warring over for millennia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question as to whether or not American audiences are ready for a comedy
about religious strife on television is a valid one. After all, <em>The Infidel</em>
played in New York on the eve of the furor that was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park51#Controversy">Park51/Cordoba House
project in lower Manhattan</a>,
one of the most volatile issues during the summer of 2010. During the
festival, I had sit-down interviews with director Josh Appignanesi, writer
David Baddiel and stars Omid Djalili and Richard Schiff.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> You can <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/04/29/candlercast-16-a
-conversation-with-the-infidel-team/">listen
to the full interview</a>, but I think some of the excerpts below
shed some light on their approach to perceived controversy.</p>

<p>involved](http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/nbc-developing-comedy-series-
version-of-british-film-the-infidel-starring-omid-djalili/) in the development
of the NBC project.</p>

<p>I suggested to both Appignanesi and Baddiel that the film goes too far in
terms of controversial imagery, specifically one scene in which Djalili
appears in a concentration camp uniform. They had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>David Baddiel:</strong> If you actually deconstruct that particular gag, it’s not
a guy who just appears in a concentration camp outfit and the audience laughs
because he’s in a concentration camp outfit. It’s a Muslim who’s having a
nightmare about the idea that he is Jewish. His subconscious, comically, is
projecting himself as various Jewish monstrosities. To me, the one you’re
going to end on there is that one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Josh Appignanesi:</strong> What’s particularly funny about that is that the
monstrous things that you might imagine Jews to be involve them being the
worst victims of the twentieth century. There’s kind of quite an inverted joke
if you look at it closely and it’s quite a subversive joke.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DB:</strong> It’s also about an anxiety. When he goes to the computer and puts
the word Jew [in a search engine] and gets a lod of hate back at him, that is
real. Google had to change it because there was so much anti-semitism that
came off the web. The point is with Mahmud it’s something that hasn’t really
occurred to him. First he finds out that he’s Jewish and that’s a problem for
his identity, then he has to deal with the fact that, if you’re Jewish, you
will have anti-semitism to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JA:</strong> And you’ll have the Holocaust as part of your history.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DB:</strong> For me, with any joke, it’s not just like “Okay, you can’t make
jokes about that thing.” I <em>never</em> think that. What I think is that you have
to look at the individual joke and the context of that individual joke and
say, “Okay; or not.” There’s still going to be people that think it’s not okay
because they think some subjects are untouchable. All subjects are touchable
within contextual grounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked whether or not it had met much resistance in the UK.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JA:</strong> People keep saying, “It’s controversial,” but then, actually, it’s
not really clear where the controversy is. They sort of think it will be
somewhere else but not for them. They might feel, “A bit edgy. That was maybe
a bit close to the bone, but I don’t find it really problematic. I liked it.”
Then who do they think will find it problematic? It usually ends up [they
think] Muslims will find it problematic because they might kill you, because
of Salman Rushdie, because of whatever. Because of South Park now<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, because
there are reactive parts of 1.1 billion people. There are a lot of Muslims out
there, some of them are bound to be nutters.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the UK we had some worries because [neither myself nor David] are Muslim.
We had some Muslim people helping out on the film…producers, consultants for
the script and stuff, but we didn’t know for sure and we were a little
worried. They’ve embraced it more than anyone. That’s our big immigrant
population is essentially Muslim or if not Muslim then “brown” people who get
stopped at airports because of what’s been happening in the world and so
identify with this character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>had received a death threat](http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-
radio/2010/apr/22/south-park-censored-fatwa-muhammad) from an extremist Muslim
Web site based out of New York.</p>

<p>What became clear instantly is how seriously the creative team took this
material. The reason the film feels “breezy” is because they didn’t just run
with the same joke for the film’s duration. The idea of a Muslim man waking up
to find he is a Jew could easily be both offensive and funny, but they didn’t
create the film to push people’s buttons.</p>

<p>But will it play on American television, especially after the film hardly
played in the US? I think it can work, and Baddiel’s involvement in the
project is certainly reassuring. However, it’s tough to forget how divided we
are in this country on issues of religion. The Park51 incidents of 2010 and
this year’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/asia/02afg
hanistan.html?pagewanted=all">Koran burning</a> by Florida pastor Terry Jones don’t bode well
for an American public primed to comically approach its differences.</p>

<p>I’ll bet that Jews and Muslims would be the least offended by the actual
material if they saw it. More likely, as Appignanesi mentioned, it will be
condemned on the grounds that the Muslims will blow us up for it. Thankfully,
these guys realize that a powder-keg that big <em>must</em> be confronted. Why not in
sitcom form?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week we saw the introduction of the first commercially available light field camera, the <a href="https://www.lytro.com/camera">Lytro</a>. But what’s a light field? From the company’s site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The light field is a core concept in imaging science….It is the amount of light traveling in every direction through every point in space….</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recording light fields requires an innovative, entirely new kind of sensor called a light field sensor. The light field sensor captures the color, intensity and vector direction of the rays of light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the Lytro camera can record all of the available light in a scene, it can capture all possible focal points. When you use it to take a picture, you just click and you’re done. Worry about focusing the photo later.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample. Click around the frame to refocus the image:</p>

<iframe align="center" width="460" height="477" src="https://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/279/embed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The technology here is pretty incredible, but it’s based on the premise that taking the time to focus a photo while shooting is time wasted. The light field camera takes the concept of point and shoot to its most literal level. Changing the focus after the shot has been taken isn’t just a tool to correct poorly focused shots. One major feature of the Lytro is that you can share your photos with an embedded viewer like the one above, allowing anyone to change the focus of the photograph. Manipulating the focal point then becomes part of the experience of viewing the photo; the viewer can become the photographer.</p>

<p>Focus is a funny thing. It wasn’t so long ago that photographers were unsure whether or not they could trust the autofocus engines in their cameras. Some even wrote it off as a fad. Autofocusing lenses are bigger, louder and heavier than their manual counterparts and they suck up more battery life to boot. The trick of the technology, the real magic of it, is that it can figure out what you want to focus on. Every time the shutter button is half-depressed, the camera processes thousands of conceivable photographic setups, matching those against the color and contrast of the light coming through the lens and using that information to figure out where the likely focal point is. Then it whips the lens’s elements into the correct position for a sharp focus. All of this happens in an instant. The faster the better.</p>

<p>The trouble with auto-focus is that it doesn’t <em>always</em> know the look you’re going for. It gets uncannily close most of the time for most types of photos, but what about more stylized scenes, when an unnatural focus is part of the photo’s allure? What about when focus is used by the photographer to obscure or frame the photo’s subject?</p>

<p>Every image is a narrative, its many parts selected, for better or worse, by the person behind the camera. Framing, focus, exposure and a host of other factors lead to a finished image. Depending on how dense your image is, there can be a bevy of focal points from which to choose from. The photographer’s decision to choose what is in focus and what isn’t is all part of the creative process. The question will now become, if focus doesn’t matter in the moment, what do you take a picture of?</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a photo whose narrative could be completely altered by the use of a light field camera:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/JFK-DNC-1960.jpg" title="John F. Kennedy, Democratic National Convention, 1960. Garry Winogrand" />

<div align="center"><em>John F. Kennedy, Democratic National Convention, 1960</em>. Garry Winogrand</div>
</p>

<p>Here we have three or four relative focal lengths. Each one tells a different story. There is the rail-work in the foreground, which helps set the stage but is mostly set-dressing. Then we have the television set with John F. Kennedy’s face, followed immediately by the candidate’s backside. Then we have the abyss, the crowd and the television cameras and the (other) photographers. Would we have anything to gain by being able to post-process this photo and move the focal point? The narrative would definitely change if Kennedy were obscured and the crowd in focus, but to what end?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/4425.jpg" title="&#34;Boy With the Bottles&#34; Rue Mouffetard, Paris, 1954. Henri Cartier-Bresson." alt="&#34;Boy With the Bottles&#34; Rue Mouffetard, Paris, 1954. Henri Cartier-Bresson." />

<div align="center"><em>&#8220;Boy With the Bottles&#8221; Rue Mouffetard, Paris, 1954</em>. Henri Cartier-Bresson.</div>
</p>

<p>Take this Henri Cartier-Bresson photo of a boy carrying wine bottles. Imagine changing the focus to the girl in the background. It would change the photo’s story, but would it be a better one? Would having the ability to see both focal points enhance the photo? I’m not sure, but it’s worth considering.</p>

<p>I imagine that photographers will quickly realize that the best light field photos are ones that have multiple narratives depending on where the viewer chooses to set the focal point. The above embedded image is a great example of this style, showing off how a photo’s layers can change how you feel about the image. Otherwise, why should anyone take the time to refocus the picture themselves?</p>

<p>Allowing those who view your work refocus the image makes them part of the photographic process. Does this then mean that artists will be able to be less deliberate since the audience can correct for their mistakes in the image? Has focus just been a nuisance, a means to an end, all these years? Or must photographers now be more deliberate in order to make the photos worth tinkering with?</p>

<p>I can’t help but wonder what the implications of the Lytro are for cinema. If this technology were able to be applied to the moving image, perhaps one day audiences will be able to change the focus of a scene while viewing a film. Each viewer would have an active, unique experience while watching the film. Again, to what end? Imagine being able to change the focus in the tent scene in David Lean’s <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>. Below are stills from a single shot in the seminal sequence.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LofA-animated-looped1.gif" title="Lawrence of Arabia Animated Tent Sequence" /></p>

<p>The examples I’ve used here are from a bygone era, long before light field sensors would make it possible to shoot without focusing. Perhaps finite focus isn’t a problem that needs correcting. Or maybe we’re moving into a completely new era in photography. Either way, I can’t wait to see what creative photos people come up with once the Lytros start shipping.</p>
