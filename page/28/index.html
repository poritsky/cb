  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hog Bay Software just released a <a href="http://blog.hogbaysoftware.com/post/33706483983/foldingtext-1-0">new app</a> that’s been in public beta for some time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FoldingText combines the best of what we’ve learned from <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> and <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a> into a new tool for plain text productivity. The foundation is a plain text outliner that uses Markdown formatting. But that’s just the start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I toyed with the beta a few times but never knew some of the awesome capabilities of FoldingText. The timers and to-do lists illustrated in the promotional video are pretty amazing. I may need to give this one another look.</p>

<p>FoldingText is on sale for $14.99 right now. If you use <a href="http://bit.ly/TqzR71">this link</a> to buy it I’ll get a few pennies to help keep the lights on here at the candler blog. I thank you in advance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning Boxee unveiled their followup to the Boxee Box: <a href="http://boxee.tumblr.com/post/33687492774/introducing-boxee-tv">Boxee TV</a>. It’s $99 and comes with an antenna built in, allowing you to watch live, over-the-air broadcasts.</p>

<p>But the real secret sauce is their “No Limits DVR,” a $14.99/month service that they describe like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of storing your recording on a local hard-drive, Boxee TV uploads your recordings to the cloud. It means there are no limits to how much you can record and no limits to where you watch - on your laptop, tablet and, of course, your TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon launch in November, No Limits DVR will be available in eight markets and rolling out to more in 2013. We’ll see about that…this is the same company that, back in 2010, <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2010/11/11/boxee-box-launches-in-nyc-promises-to-bring-tons-of-video-to-the-living-room/">promised to add Hulu Plus</a> to the Boxee Box in similar “sometime next year” fashion, a promise that remains unfulfilled.</p>

<p>But the price is right to compete.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jason Del Rey at Ad Age <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/microsoft-prepping-1-5-billion-windows-8-marketing-campaign/237737/">follows the money</a> on a claim that Microsoft will spend between $1.5 and $1.8 billion on its Windows 8 ad campaign, a figure cited as fact by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/microsoft-to-go-all-in-with-1-5b-windows-8-marketing-blitz">TechCrunch</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3492648/windows-8-marketing-campaign-ads-rumor">The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The outlet cited for that estimate? Forbes. Which is kinda, sorta true.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/netapp/2012/10/11/windows-8-release-date-tablet-microsoft-cloud/2/">A post on Forbes.com by Dave Einstein</a> does indeed say that Microsoft “will roll out with a marketing campaign estimated at $1.5 to $1.8 billion.” But Mr. Einstein isn’t a Forbes journalist; he’s a freelancer hired by data-storage company – and Forbes advertiser – NetApp to write for NetApp’s blog on Forbes.com, part of Forbes’ BrandVoice (formerly AdVoice) program, for which <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/forbes-advoice-takers-revenue-impact-unclear/236533/">advertisers pay to publish posts</a> on the site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Del Rey chalks this up to the “new, new world of media,” but I’d say this is simply a journalistic failure on all accounts. Einstein’s piece <em>does</em> appear under the Forbes banner, a dicy game for Forbes’ editorial wing. Of course, there is a nice little icon for BrandVoice with a helpful drop-down that states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forbes BrandVoice™ allows marketers to connect directly with the Forbes audience by enabling them to create content – and participate in the conversation – on the Forbes digital publishing platform. Each BrandVoice™ is written, edited and produced by the marketer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tiniest bit of elbow-grease from any one of the outlets that cited Einstein’s post would have revealed that Forbes <em>did not</em> break this news, which of course throws into question its veracity.</p>

<p>But anyway, I need to just fall in line with the new, new media, I guess, where anyone with a big enough check can fool bloggers into thinking an ad is actually news.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nicholas D. Kristof’s column in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/a-possibly-fatal-mistake.html?pagewanted=all">this Sunday’s <em>New York Times</em> went live online today</a>. In it he recounts the recent health struggles of his Harvard roommate, Scott Androes, who is battling prostate cancer without insurance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all make mistakes, and a humane government tries to compensate for our misjudgments. That’s why highways have guardrails, why drivers must wear seat belts, why police officers pull over speeders, why we have fire codes. In other modern countries, Scott would have been insured, and his cancer would have been much more likely to be detected in time for effective treatment.</p>

  <p>Is that a nanny state? No, it’s a civilized one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marco Arment, creator of <a href="http://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, is probably public enemy number one in the publishing industry, and he’s at it again. Today he is introducing <a href="http://the-magazine.org/">The Magazine</a>, an iOS app and fortnightly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> publication. Four articles every two weeks, $1.99 a month.</p>

<p>I’m downloading the app and will spend some time with it tonight, but perhaps the most interesting bit is Marco’s approach to acquiring great content. From the <a href="http://the-magazine.org/1/foreword">foreword of Issue 1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…The Magazine operates under liberal author terms: authors retain ownership of their writing, and they may republish it on their own sites just one month after it appears here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is basically a pay wall wrapped in an app, and it may well work. I wonder, though, whether this boon to authors might not be detrimental to the outlet itself. The Magazine covers “meaningful editorial and big-picture articles.” That’s the stuff we can all wait a month to read.</p>

<p>But Marco views this as an experiment, and is putting his chips on the table:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it doesn’t turn a profit within two months — just four issues — I’ll shut it down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet it turns a profit this week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great post on <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/9457207028/what-is-mobile-photography-kawasaki">Connect</a>, a new site from the makers of <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the reality is that photography has been changing and evolving for nearly two centuries, from its crude beginnings and complicated chemical processes only handled by professionals to the instantaneous and much more accessible digital world we’re living in today. The latest evolution of the medium, what’s been dubbed ‘mobile photography,’ is perhaps the most radical change to be seen yet – as it doesn’t just involve a change in how (and what) photos are taken, but also in the growing number of people taking them, and how they are now shared, consumed and ultimately viewed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DPReview has been my go-to resource for all things photographic since before I got into DSLR photography. Glad to see they’re moving into mobile, just like photographers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve grown quite fond of TextExpander over the past year, but never more so than when I’m blogging with Octopress. Slowly I’ve built up an arsenal of snippets to make writing posts easier. Allow me to explain the thinking behind a few.</p>

<p>If you’re impatient just head to the bottom of the article for download info. And if you’re uninterested in this blogging from blogging, I’ll see you at the next post.</p>

<h3 id="rake-what-rake">Rake? What Rake?</h3>

<p>The fastest way to start up a new post is to <code>cd</code> into your Octopress install in a Terminal and type <code>rake new_post["Post Title"]</code>. This generates a brand new <code>.markdown</code> file in your <code>/source/_posts/</code> directory with filled in YAML front matter. So with my sample rake just a few sentences back, we would get a new file called <code>2012-10-10-post-title.markdown</code> pre-populated with the following:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">---
</span><span class="line">layout: post
</span><span class="line">title: "Post Title"
</span><span class="line">date: 2012-10-10 12:54
</span><span class="line">comments: true
</span><span class="line">categories: 
</span><span class="line">---</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I never really enjoyed having to go to the command line just to start a new post. Worse, I usually don’t know what I want to call a post, nor what the URL should be right away, but I like getting that YAML filled in nonetheless. Lucky for me, all I need to do is create a file in the <code>/source/_posts/</code> folder with the proper file naming convention and YAML filled in. Enter TextExpander.</p>

<h3 id="editing-text-via-ftp">Editing Text via FTP</h3>

<p>Quick sidebar here. Back in August, Gabe over at Macdrifter gave an excellent overview of <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/working-remotely-with-sublime-text-and-bbedit-ftp-access.html">how he edits text via FTP</a>. He provides detailed instructions to set up both Sublime Text 2 and BBEdit to work with text on an FTP server. I’ve tried both but prefer the latter, with one difference: I use <a href="http://www.textwrangler.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>.</p>

<p>TextWrangler is probably the best bargain on the Mac inasmuch as it’s free. It’s essentially a stripped down version of BBEdit, but the features it’s missing hardly hamper it, if you ask me. For example, it still connects via FTP or SFTP to the server and directory of your choosing.</p>

<p>Following Gabe’s instructions, I set up a path right to my <code>source/_posts</code> directory. Now, I can open from (⌘^O) or save to (⌘^S) my server right from the keyboard. Now all I need to do is properly format that YAML and URL.</p>

<p>Let me get this URL thingamajig out of the way. Here’s what the TextExpander snippet looks like:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">%Y-%m-%d-%|.markdown</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>That gives you a file with today’s date and your cursor correctly placed so you can start typing the filename. Remember, all lowercase and no spaces. I use <code>uurl</code> to call this one when I’m saving a file.</p>

<p>Now, as to the YAML front matter. I’ve got a basic one that I call with <code>yyaml</code>. You can dig into the snippet at the bottom to really see what’s going on, but basically it gives you a blank YAML with the time and date pre-populated and the cursor positioned to give the post a title.</p>

<p>Most of my posts on the candler blog, however, are link posts. For those I have to add a line to my YAML for <code>external-url</code>. For that I now turn to an AppleScript snippet that fills in almost everything I need to post right away.</p>

<p>The groundwork for this was <a href="http://canadian-fury.com/2012/09/06/applescript-and-friends-octopress-textexpander-and-ruby/">laid by Doug Stephen</a> with his snippet to strip out some oddities from a URL and create a new link blog type post from it. In his method he actually modified his rake task to create link posts when he entered a title with a specific format, but that’s all command line-y, so it’s no good for me. The brilliance in his work was actually stripping out the long, useless additions URLs, especially from RSS feeds, tend to have. All of that has been retained in my tweak here.</p>

<p>So here’s the workflow I was looking for (and have actually achieved):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a cool story I want to link in Safari.</li>
  <li>Select the text I plan to quote.</li>
  <li>Fire up a blank TextWrangler document, type TextExpander snippet.</li>
  <li>Editorialize as needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following AppleScript, when saved as a snippet, does all of that, though it’s not the snippet I prefer.</p>

<p>It works excellently, as advertised. And thanks to Doug Stephen’s work cluttered URLs come across clean. My one gripe was that, since the whole snippet is an AppleScript, the cursor cannot be placed within the YAML text. But I found a workaround.</p>

<h3 id="snippets-all-the-way-down">Snippets All the Way Down</h3>

<p>Until just yesterday, I had no idea one could embed a TextExpander snippet inside a TextExpander snippet. Let me say that again: <strong>you can embed a TextExpander snippet inside a TextExpander</strong>. And as many times as you like. It’s as easy as adding putting in a snippet placeholder.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I created separate snippets from the AppleScript above to get the page title, the URL and the selected text; three separate AppleScript snippets. Then I created my snippet for link post YAML front matter incorporating the snippets for title, URL and quoted text appropriately.</p>

<p>The main advantage here is that users of other static blogging engines can incorporate the AppleScript to fit their YAML template. Additionally, it’s much easier to change the text output from within TextExpander than to modify the ray AppleScript.</p>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>I’m using <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/Brett-s-TextExpander-Snippets">Brett Terpstra’s nifty TextExpander tool</a> to help you make some sense of the snippets I’ve listed above. You can see them all laid out <a href="http://poritsky.com/te-snippets/">here</a>. Please note that I haven’t implemented Brett’s “prefix” system here, so the expansion abbreviations won’t change if you add commas as a prefix. I recommend downloading the snippets and adjusting their abbreviations as needed. Here’s <a href="http://poritsky.com/te-snippets/te-download.php?group=Octopress%20Snippets&amp;prefix=%2C%2C">the download link</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s about it. Happy blogging.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Other World Computing <a href="http://blog.macsales.com/15036-a-closer-look-at-thunderbolt-external-storage">dives into the pros and cons of Thunderbolt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To paraphrase though, ‘with great power comes greater complexity’. This complexity is both in the implementation of Thunderbolt as well as considerations for when Thunderbolt is truly the ideal solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got my 2011 iMac specifically because of the advent of Thunderbolt, and have felt like a dope ever since. My thinking was that I would use my iPad for all mobile computing and the iMac will be there for heavy lifting, like video and audio editing. Thunderbolt seemed to be the interface stopgap; <em>if</em> I needed fast drives or to hook up a deck, it would be there for me.</p>

<p>But Thunderbolt drives remain overpriced and hard to find. USB 3.0 SSDs are more reasonable and best my trusty FireWire 800, but now I need to get a Thunderbolt hub, none of which have shipped as promised.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you’re annoyed (like me) that Thunderbolt isn’t yet the way of the future, OWC offers some sound advice on how to stay calm and carry on.</p>
