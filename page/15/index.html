  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, hours before its funding window closed, <a href="http://caseymalone.com/post/53339539674/this-is-not-fucking-harmless">comedian Casey Malone discovered</a> that a fully funded Kickstarter project, “Above the Game,” purporting to be a manual on meeting women actually contained offensive, abusive material; a blank check to go out an sexually assault any woman you meet. In a <a href="http://caseymalone.com/post/53394156872/hey-everyone-if-youre-here-its-probably">follow-up</a>, Kickstarter told him that, under their current guidelines, the project would have to be funded. I discussed this at length on <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/2013/06/21/the-crowdcrowd-podcast-episode-5/">The CrowdCrowd podcast</a> Thursday evening, but by the time our episode posted Kickstarter had already issued <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/we-were-wrong">an apology</a> for their handling of the matter.</p>

<p>Under the headline “We were wrong,” the team lays bare why they didn’t pull the funding and how they intend to prevent similar projects getting funding in the future. I am content with this response.</p>

<p>Ben Brooks, someone I would say was a <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/12/glif-review/">onetime</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/04/dark-sky-review/">influential</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/elevation-dock/">booster</a> of Kickstarter, is <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/06/good-for-nothing-chickenshits/">not so happy</a>. He calls out the company for being “chicken shits” and draws his line in the sand (again: <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/06/kickstarter-allowed-funding-for-a-sexual-assault-manual/">1</a>,<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/09/ks-conundrum/">2</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…I won’t ever fund a project, or promote one, on KickStarter again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I respect Ben’s opinion, and I agree with him to a point. As I said on The CrowdCrowd, I really don’t care about the headache this caused for any employee at Kickstarter. If I worry about anything at all, it’s the community of striving artists and creators, not the maintainers of the service who take a cut on the work of others (including “Above the Game”). But Ben’s not telling the whole story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They were chicken shits and allowed the funding to go through, while knowing it was wrong. Then the story got too big and they coughed up $25k to a great charity, but still allowed a manual on sexual assault to be funded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like the sort of papering over of scandals we’ve grown accustomed to from politicians and conglomorates. That <em>would</em> be a chicken shit move if that’s all Kickstarter did. But it’s not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…we are prohibiting “seduction guides,” or anything similar, effective immediately. This material encourages misogynistic behavior and is inconsistent with our mission of funding creative works. These things do not belong on Kickstarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not the stuff of a non-apology. This is actual change; a real preventative measure.</p>

<p>We live on the Web now. New ideas, new communities will continue to endure terrible growing pains. <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/factsheet">Craigslist</a> has <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/craigslist-killer-death-penalty-article-1.1307856">facilitated</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/us/22indict.html">murder</a>. <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> propogates a culture of <a href="http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web">misogyny</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/11/william-shatner-reddit_n_2661932.html">racism</a> and <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/demand-reddit-remove-subreddits-that-promote-violent-behavior-and-severe-discrimination">violence</a> on a scale never before conceived. And yet both sites have much to offer the world. There is ugliness everywhere; it’s how we handle it that matters.</p>

<p>Kickstarter fucked up, but they did so in the name of their benefit-of-the-doubt ethos that creatives know best how to make great work that enriches the world. We’re all learning how to do this together. I’m pleased they’re making an effort to do better in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon, writer <a href="http://cargocollective.com/kenlowery">Ken Lowery</a> took to Twitter to vent a bit about movie criticism and the reliance on box office as a conversation point. It’s an insightful read.</p>

<p>I’ve compiled his tweets over at <a href="http://storify.com/poritsky/ken-lowery-on-box-office">Storify</a> and organized them below (with permission). The sentences are linked to corresponding tweets. Taken together, they tell the story of the perversion of criticism and fandom into formidable marketing tools. It makes for a great read.</p>

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345238568941260800">I think you guys know I love movie criticism. I really do. I take it seriously and value arts criticism in general as absolutely necessary.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345238640009551872">But Rotten Tomatoes is the fucking pits. Find critics you like and/or trust (for variable definitions of “trust”); read them; be content.</a></p>

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345238692400599040">It’s not a game. It’s not a race. Do not let studios make you foot soldiers in their dick-measuring wars.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345238921803866113">Box office does not matter. Aggregate percentages and star ratings – and no critic worth their salt likes those things – do not matter.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239142076141568">What did it do to you? That is what matters.</a></p>

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239350709198848">I will hate Harry Knowles forever because he was INSTRUMENTAL in getting sentimental nerds turned into street teams for movie PR machines.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239496792612865">Why the FUCK should we care about opening weekend B.O.?

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239819770789889">I get it – getting into the guts of why something moved you how it did is hard work, and arguments about quantities are so much easier.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239918064316416">We can theorize and bullshit about same-day foreign premieres or whatever-the-balls because it’s something like hard data.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239959948652544">(It isn’t, really, but it FEELS like hard data, which makes it easier to compare A to B.)</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kenlowery/status/345239981574475776">I swear to you: NONE OF THAT MATTERS.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/06/mos-mutes.png" title="Mute Filters" /></p>

<p>At exactly 10pm CDT this past Monday, the review embargo for <em>Man of Steel</em> was lifted, allowing any site to publish articles about the film a full 73 hours before the public at large would be able to see it. This feels a bit early to me, <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> though certainly not the earliest of late.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Most of the people I follow on Twitter (or on any network) are critics. I love reading their snap reactions to films, following the links to interesting things they share and generally basking in the wash of cinematic writings available to us at this unique moment in the history of information. But by 10:05pm on Monday I&rsquo;d had enough. The moment the embargo lifted a number of people I follow unleashed their reviews and the conversation amongst those who had seen the film began. At 10:17pm I switched Twitter clients to <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> (from my preferred <a href="http://twitterrific.com/ios">Twitterrific</a>) so I could set up <a href="https://twitter.com/poritsky/status/344292566289768448">search filters</a> to excise <em>Man of Steel</em> tweets from my timeline.</p>

<p>I feel confident saying that today, in the US at least, there are more self-identifying (and duly credentialed) film critics and journalists than at any point in the history of the movies.  Criticism isn&rsquo;t dying by any stretch, in fact it&rsquo;s flourishing. Yet it feels like, as a community, we are insulating ourselves from the rest of the world. A lot of the criticism I see feels as though it is aimed at the same crowd that produces it. Critics writing for critics; the rest of the world can watch if they like.</p>

<p>When the <em>Man of Steel</em> embargo lifted, suddenly hundreds (thousands?) of people privy to advance screenings were all in the same place (Twitter) at the same time, ready to discuss it. Personally, I&rsquo;m not worried about spotting a spoiler. I just don&rsquo;t like being on the outside of a conversation of a film I won&rsquo;t be seeing the film until it opens. I could barely make it 5 minutes on Twitter without getting burned out of hearing about it. And I&rsquo;m part of this community. I can only imagine what it&rsquo;s like for someone else, on the outside looking in.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that film critics have less sway on audiences than ever before, that binary watchdogs like Rotten Tomatoes have become the barometers of quality for the masses? The more critics write for themselves the more they cut themselves off from the rest of the world.  But the community is so big now, who cares? Who needs non-critics in a world where your closest friends have already seen the movie you want to talk about 73 hours before the plebes even can?</p>

<p>A word on embargoes. Press screenings come with a caveat: journalists can&rsquo;t write about the film they&rsquo;ve seen until a set date a time. Publicists and marketers set when the embargo will lift. The consequence for publishing early is burning the bridge with the studio and/or publicist that set the embargo. In general they&rsquo;re a mostly reasonable thing that allows all outlets to operate on an even playing field, but make no mistake: embargoes are a marketing tool devised to ensure maximum press saturation.</p>

<p>Back in 2011, when <em>New Yorker</em> critic David Denby broke an embargo by publishing his <em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em> review two weeks early, producer Scott Rudin told him <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-scott-rudin-replies-to-david-denbys-embargo-break-of-dragon-tattoo-in-the-new-yorker">in an email</a> he &ldquo;very badly damaged&rdquo; the film. What he meant was that Denby upended Sony&rsquo;s carefully timed marketing campaign. An embargo is set so that no one is talking about your film before the studio wants them to, but there is nothing that says you have to publish the moment the embargo lifts.</p>

<p>Which brings us to 10pm CDT, Monday June 10, 2013, when my feed was firebombed with <em>Man of Steel</em> reviews.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As of this writing (61 hours after the embargo lifted), the <em>New York Times</em>, which in my opinion retains one of the steadiest hands in the business of film criticism, is yet to publish a review of the film. I doubt it&rsquo;s because one of their critics hasn&rsquo;t written one. They publish reviews the night before a film&rsquo;s New York or nationwide release; a studio&rsquo;s preference doesn&rsquo;t change the schedule.</p>

<p>Of course, the <em>Times</em> doesn&rsquo;t need to elbow for page-views; the readers actually come for the criticism. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a lesson there.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I bought <a href="http://readkitapp.com">ReadKit</a>, an app that’s only been around since January but nonetheless made the jump to 2.0 this week. Fundamentally, ReadKit is a Mac client for <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, <a href="http://readability.com">Readability</a>, <a href="https://delicious.com">Delicious</a> and <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>. Or rather it was.</p>

<p>This update turns ReadKit into an RSS client, including sync capabilities for <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.newsblur.com">NewsBlur</a>. As a Fever user myself, this was the main feature that got me to plunk down $5. Currently I have a <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid</a> app for Fever, which works well, though I’d rather have a native app for reading RSS. ReadKit seemed like a bargain as a catch-all app.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, right now ReadKit is unusable as a Mac Fever RSS client for me. I’ve got 251 feeds; trying to get one sync to complete took an inordinate amount of time. I don’t know where the bottleneck occurs. It could be my server, Fever’s API or ReadKit itself. This isn’t the first Fever client I’ve had issues getting sync to work with though, so I imagine it’s a combination of all three.</p>

<p>That said, ReadKit is a brilliant Instapaper client. Overnight it has changed the way I use the service. I can’t recommend it highly enough on this front.</p>

<p>I first got Instapaper Free way back in January 2009. I used the service constantly to queue up morning reads on the subway. When the iPad came out (and I bought one) I finally made the upgrade to Instapaper Pro, and it is without question the best $5 (!) I’ve ever spent. I’ve tried the competition, but Marco Arment, Instapaper’s creator, always did an amazing job at heading off the other apps and making a simply great app for reading articles on a digital device.</p>

<p>In the four years since I started using Instapaper, I never thought to clean it up. I would save articles to it, and maybe I would read them, maybe not. Usually not. For the past many months (years?) I’ve become overwhelmed with the unending stream of unread articles in the app. I would open it up on my iPad and want to read everything but not know where to start, so I’d close it and go do something else. When I fly, I ritualistically load it up with long reads to keep me occupied en route, instead of, you know, reading the months’ worth of great articles already there. And so it has gotten bloated.</p>

<p>ReadKit to the rescue.</p>

<p>I basically decided to declare Instapaper bankruptcy and admit that I probably won’t read the thousands of unread articles in my account. Making sure I wasn’t going to do any irreparable damage, I exported my bookmarks (limited to the most recent 2000 articles) out of Instapaper and imported them into Pinboard.</p>

<p>Because why not? Pinboard is the safe deposit box of my Internet wanderings, my cold storage, if you will. I don’t mind loading it up with superfluous (and probably redundant) bookmarks. Instapaper, in contrast, <em>should</em> be the place I go to read interesting things, the sort of beaten path along which I travel. But it had become the cold storage over time. Now, back to how I changed that.</p>

<p>Once I knew my bookmarks were mostly backed up to Pinboard, I used one of ReadKit’s new power features: Smart Folders. Just like the smart folders in Mail, ReadKit allows you to create extremely powerful folders based on granular searches of the content you have loaded into the app. I’ve barely scratched the surface of their potential, but they pack a punch. Smart Folders can search across accounts, so you could have quick access to any article that had, say, “movies” in the headline or body in all of your accounts. They can even trigger notifications, which could be useful if you’re waiting for specific news via RSS.</p>

<p>The Smart Folder that I created to clean up Instapaper was very simple: collect any unread article in Instapaper that hasn’t been added in the last month. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/05/readkit-smarts.png" title="Older than 1 Month" /> </p>

<p>The Unread folder under ReadKit’s Instapaper header is limited to 500 articles at a time (by Instapaper). So at any given time this smart folder had some 470 articles in it. At first I started filing away articles I know I want to revisit soon into folders (which I also reorganized, but you don’t want to hear about that) and spent some time deleting obviously superfluous articles. I even read a few of them as I went through this process. Anything I didn’t know what to do with got archived, which is as simple as selecting and typing A in ReadKit.</p>

<p>Once that was done for the first set of articles, I’d simply reload and do it again for the next set of 500, going all the way back to 2009. Reload, select all, archive, repeat. I did this until my Unread folder was down to only the articles added in the past month. From there it was just a matter of going through the past month’s worth of articles, filing and archiving those I had read and deleting what didn’t belong. Now I’m down to a svelte 17 articles I actually <em>want</em> to read. And I will.</p>

<p>Yesterday I read more long pieces from the Internet than I have in too long a time. It was nice to open Instapaper and be able to quickly pick a worthy piece to read. As a result I’m also more careful about what I put into Instapaper and why. Things I want to read should go to Instapaper; things I need to save go to Pinboard. It sounds simple but for the longest time I used the services interchangeably. Without ReadKit I may not have been able to find a way to clean up Instapaper and rediscover it.</p>

<p>A few more words on ReadKit itself. Visually it’s a simple, stunning app. I like all of the themes for reading text, and I’m glad that I’m able to pick which typeface my articles appear in. It’s just customizable enough, but not to the point of being overwhelming. I loaded up my Pinboard account, but personally I prefer the Pinboard site to any native tools. However, I may find better uses for it in the near future. One other nice touch in ReadKit is its ability to “save and restore” your reading position. This sort of works with Instapaper’s own progress syncing, though mostly it’s useful for retaining your place while navigating away from an article. It’s an optional feature but a pleasant one.</p>

<p>One request would be to add some form of word count to the app. I was hoping there would be a way to set a word count threshold for Smart Folders so I could sift out the really long reads from the short ones. When I sit down to pick which article I read, article length is the first metric I check, cleverly made visible in Instapaper’s iOS app by a series of dots below the headline. Perhaps in time this will be added, but of course it would be a luxury.</p>

<p>ReadKit 2 is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readkit/id588726889?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">$4.99 on the Mac App Store</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Go get it. You won’t be sorry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a sport that clings to its traditions — from managers wearing uniforms to the playing of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” during the seventh-inning stretch — one time-honored feature at the ballpark has taken an absurd turn, at least for the game’s purists: the ceremonial first pitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m torn. The first pitch <em>is</em> a time-honored tradition that is being sullied by corporate sponsorship. On the other hand, the Phillie Phanatic’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW-ljrm7a6g">Hatfield hot dog launcher</a> holds a special place in my heart and has nothing to do with the game either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With so many lens flares, you’d be sipping on your drink about eight times per minute. At this rate, neither men nor women would make it out alive. But because body weight plays a big role in [blood alcohol content], men would at least make it past the first act before their breathing fails. Men make it 85 minutes before trekking into darkness while women only make it about half that. That’s what happens when you beam over five liters of alcohol into your system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like the look of Omnifocus 2 but it’s not ready for everyday use so I decided to make a theme for OF1 with the renewed look.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve had access to the OmniFocus 2 “private test” for about a month, but right now it’s not usable on a daily basis (for me, at least). This theme <em>really</em> dresses OF1 up like OF2 in a way that is, surprisingly, nice. If you want to get a feel for where Omni is taking the design but retain the functionality you’re used to, this theme works quite nicely.</p>

  <p>…leaving the theatre after “Upstream Color,” I felt reasonably confident that I understood what had happened, plotwise. “But what’s it about?” my husband asked. I felt much less sure about that, but as I thought it over in the days that followed, and as I pulled a few transcendentalist classics off the shelf, I began to wonder if I’d been watching a movie by the premier Thoreauvian of our time.</p>

<p>This is easily the best piece of writing on Shane Carruth’s film yet.</p>
