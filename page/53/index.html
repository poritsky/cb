  <div class="entry-content"><p>After months of buildup and failed launches, Readability’s <a href="http://www.readability.com/ios">iOS app</a> is finally here. I downloaded it this morning and started tossing articles in it. So, how does it stack up?</p>

<p>While I recognize that there is a cottage industry of “read later” apps on iOS, to me, the gold standard against which all are measured is <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">Instapaper</a>. I’ve been using Instapaper for a few years now and it has completely changed the way I approach browsing the web.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s unfair to judge a new app in the shadow of a well established one, but for me, and I’m guessing many other iPad and iPhone/iPod Touch owners, whether or not Readability stays installed hinges on the question, “Is it better than Instapaper?” So, is it?</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/02/paper-css.jpg" title="Paper Jokes" /></p>

<p>The other day, I sat down to write but nothing was coming. I loaded up my document in <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s excellent Markdown live preview (and so much more) app. As I flipped through my collection of custom stylesheets to preview the paltry paragraph with, I decided I wanted something a little different. So I fired up TextMate and started whipping up a new design.</p>

<p>HTML and CSS, by their nature, have to be released out in the open. Want to know how someone made a site you like? Well, the source code is right there if you know where to look. As a result, the Internet is littered with snippets of code shared by many the kind-hearted souls in the design community.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like HTML all that much. It has been a long slog from my first Web site (um, 15 years ago?) to my current level of head-above-water-ness. I do, however, <em>love</em> to tinker with CSS. That&rsquo;s where the real fun happens. Marked outputs some solid HTML5, much better than what I&rsquo;d start off with from scratch. Since it&rsquo;s based on Webkit (i.e. Safari) there are a bevy of CSS3 tricks you can throw at it.</p>

<p>One feature that has become indispensable as I help write the custom CSS for <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/02/08/fountain-for-marked/">Fountain for Marked</a> is the ability to track CSS changes. If you&rsquo;re using a Custom stylesheet in Marked, you can edit the CSS and the changes will refresh every time you hit save. Change the color of an element, save it, and, boom, there it is in Marked.</p>

<p>Now, back to me, trying to write but getting sidetracked writing a custom preview for Marked. I wanted to create a theme based on an early (ultimately foolhardy) Screenplay Markdown stylesheet that made the script look like a piece of paper. I figured I could throw it together in a new sheet pretty quickly.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I modified the custom sheet that comes with Marked and felt pretty good, but something was missing. So I did a little wandering around the web and found some neat CSS tricks that I wanted to try out but never had the chance to. </p>

<p>Everything I have ever learned about CSS I have learned by messing with code. There are so many creative folks out there coming up with new and interesting ways to use stylesheets<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> that it rarely seems worth waiting for a full-on project to play with the weirdest and wildest bits of code. I&rsquo;m loving just throwing CSS at Marked (like these <a href="http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/">beautiful patterns</a>), breaking it and figuring out how to tame it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Marked, besides being a great Markdown preview app, is also a great CSS playground, a place where you can go nuts and make a mess without any consequences. I don&rsquo;t have to track my changes or worry about breaking the way something works elsewhere on the site; I can just have fun and take the code for a spin. Hopefully, when I actually decide to work on a new design, my bag of tricks will have expanded.</p>

<p>Oh, and that custom stylesheet I decided to work on the other day is featured in the image at the top of this article. You can <a href="http://cl.ly/3a0j1K1k2H2R2u1Q1K2s">go grab it here</a>. Happy writing, if you ever get to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I noticed during Sunday’s Oscars (which <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/02/27/oscars-2012/">I rather liked</a>) was the abundance of movie-themed commercials ABC aired. Either I recognize this every year and simply forget to remember or they aired them in stronger numbers this year. It’s an entertaining little thing, making commercials geared toward movie-lovers.</p>

<p>I noticed a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN9LCARJyfw">new commercial</a> for the Samsung Galaxy Note, the company’s 5.3 inch, er, crossover phone/tablet.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It comes complete with a stylus, a marquis feature in Samsung’s book. Speaking as someone who mastered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)">Graffiti</a> on a Palm Pilot, it is my general experience that styli suck. They get lost, they’re imprecise and , more often than not, they give your hand cramps in the space of a minute or two.</p>

<p>Still, you’ve got to give it to Samsung for marketing their flagship 5.3 inch thingy-of-the-month as <em>the</em> device for the stylus crowd. They even gave the device a name that reflects a very paper and pen mentality: Note. This new ad pushes interesting uses for the stylus, including drawing messages over photos and adjusting a bar-graph.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The first thing they show anyone using the stylus for, though, is marking up a screenplay. Here’s the still from about 22 seconds in:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/02/galaxy-note-script.jpg" title="Samsung Galaxy Note Screenplay" /></p>

<p>The file is called “script.pdf” and we watch as our writer (or, more likely, reader) goes and highlights a character’s name in pink. This is the most compelling argument Samsung makes for a stylus. Stu Maschwitz <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2012/2/10/what-i-do-with-my-ipad-part-3-read-screenplays.html">recently laid out</a> the biggest challenge to reading scripts on a tablet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one reads a printed screenplay without a pen in hand. So a tablet that allows “reading” a PDF isn’t enough to replace a hardcopy for the work of reading a screenplay. We need digital dog-ears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kudos to Samsung for presenting a real-world problem and solution in their commercial. The other use-case scenarios they present don’t make much sense.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I have about a million questions to go along with the brief demo though, like how has the page been cropped, how do you turn pages, how do you change the highlight color of the stylus or make it into a pencil for annotation and does the apparently fine level of handwriting that appears on the screen happen at this zoom level or is it impossible to achieve that on the device in real-life?</p>

<p>I owned a <a href="http://www.tenonedesign.com/products.php">Pogo stylus</a> for a hot minute some time ago but found it to be a mostly useless addition to my iPad. A lot has changed since then (most apps now correct for your wrist touching the screen). The landscape of capacitive styli has grown with entrants like Studio Neat’s <a href="http://www.studioneat.com/products/cosmonaut">Cosmonaut</a> and Wacom’s <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Bamboo/BambooStylus.aspx">Bamboo Stylus</a>; maybe I should reconsider my stance on whether or not they fit into my workflow.</p>

<p>Regardless, I’m curious what app is featured in the Galaxy Note commercial and what users are saying about it. If anyone knows, please share in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cynicism seems to be the prevailing theme among Oscar commentators the morning after the big event. The awards went to the wrong people, the ceremony was stale, Billy Crystal was too old and out of touch, etc. Yawn. What seems old and staid to me is this Monday morning bitching, the tropes of which haven’t changed since Crystal last donned tails and took the stage.</p>

<p>Overall I enjoyed the 84th Academy Awards show. I don’t begrudge Crystal for rehashing old bits, though I wish he could have breathed new life into some of them. The opening montage was able to eek out a few inspired edits (<em>Moneyball’s</em> baseball scouts as “young” writers), however it would have benefitted from a through-line plot better than “Should I host again?” Never mind that Crystal landed the gig on a technicality thanks to Brett Ratner’s big mouth, a fact never mentioned or mocked.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The real crime of the show wasn’t creative, but technical. If anyone’s ears need rapping this morning it’s the sound crew. All night there was feedback from the microphones onstage, an annoying, echoed pitch that could be heard below everything. The stage mic even picked up Natalie Portman’s (admittedly misplaced) applauding fits as she presented the award for Best Actor. Worse, the sound was so horribly mixed that whenever there was music and speech at the same time, such as during Crystal’s medley or when the announcer shared facts about winners, dialogue was nearly inaudible. This is inexcusable. People can argue whether or not the show had any chops, but if you can’t hear the damn thing it doesn’t make a difference.</div>

<p>I have always found core photographic concepts difficult to understand in the digital realm. Buying different film stocks, for example, has always made more sense to me than committing to a single digital sensor. This video by Dylan Bennett does a great job of explaining digital for digital’s sake, that is without the context of legacy film analogies.</p>

<p>Clear, concise and useful. I just learned a lot about what actually happens when I boost my camera’s ISO.</p>

In two years, the group, which started as a drunken joke in a bar, has become the quickest-growing krewe in the city, and a center of the amateur costume culture in New Orleans.</p><footer><strong>-David Thier</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/us/wookiee-invasion-at-new-orleans-mardi-gras-parade.html">The New York Times</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>This article is riddled with all kinds of wonderful <em>Star Wars</em> puns, like the “Sci Fi Brass Band and the Wild Tchewbacchatoulas.” Sounds like a lot of fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I poke fun at Final Draft all the time, but I try to be nice and respectful. I’m done.</p>

<p>Fuck Final Draft.</p>

<p>Here’s what pushed me over the edge:</p>

<blockquote><p>As of 16 February 2012, telephone calls to their support line will cost a cool <strong><em>$25.00 per call</em></strong>. This new premium service replaces the previous per-minute billing systems which proved unpopular with many.</p><footer><strong>-MovieScope Magazine</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.moviescopemag.com/24-fps/final-draft-inc-announce-new-technical-support-policy/">February 17, 2012</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I had to read that a few times to wrap my head around it. $25 a phone call? Does it come with a lap dance? Final Draft costs $250 for goodness sake. They can’t field questions over the phone gratis for that kind of money?</p>

<p>What really upsets me is that Final Draft doesn’t seem to understand how much better other developers are able to approach customer service than they can. You know how I got involved with Screenplay Markdown for Marked in the first place? I <a href="http://twitter.com/poritsky/statuses/132857242004357122">whined</a> to Brett Terpstra on Twitter and he e-mailed me some code. I once had some file corruption in OmniFocus; an Omni Group support ninja e-mailed me a fixed copy of my database. LaCie, the hard drive manufacturer, once traded a series of e-mails with me over a bunk drive. None of those experiences cost me a penny.</p>

<p>I know, that kind of support doesn’t scale, but I have trouble believing that Final Draft has <em>that</em> many paying customers (with valid serial numbers) who would call in for support. What does $250 buy you, anyway?</p>

<p>It’s time to kill Final Draft.</p>

<p>If you can, don’t use it.</p>
