  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>Nintendo is the clear winner at this year’s E3 with the introduction of its
Wii U console as well as an innovative new touchscreen controller. For years,
Nintendo has been blowing Sony and Microsoft out of the water by going after
the casual gaming market. The original Wii was a runaway success despite the
fact that its low-powered innards only allowed for outmoded SD video and
somewhat blocky graphics. The Wii U will change that, offering full 1080p HD
video and markedly improved graphics. That alone would make Nintendo a winner,
but there’s more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve already told myself I’m not allowed to buy a Wii U, but I’ve got over a
year to reconsider.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>Fortunately, the new machine will output HD, so it’s a step up from the
Wii’s capabilities — and judging from the videos and stills we’ve seen of the
system’s graphics output so far, it’s a <em>big</em> step up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a new Wii, and that’s pretty awesome. But Nintendo’s new flagship
console has been overshadowed by its 6 inch touchscreen controller.
Personally, the last thing I need is another touchscreen thingamajig in my
living room. This would never happen, but I really just wish I could use my
iPad or iPhone as a Wii controller. No word on pricing yet; available “2012.”</p>

  <p>Apple announced a <em>lot</em> of news; there is much to talk and think about. But
the key line was when Steve Jobs, describing iCloud replacing iTunes as your
digital hub, said, “We’re going to demote the PC and the Mac to just be a
device.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>iCloud is the new iTunes. The tethered digital hub is dead; long live the
wireless digital hub. Apple sees iCloud as shaping the next ten years the way
the iTunes-on-your-Mac/PC digital hub shaped the last ten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A short, great piece from John Gruber aptly titled “Demoted”. That demotion of
the Mac and PC is certainly a point of concern, especially as we await a new
version of Final Cut Pro. Still, I think Apple is headed in a good direction,
and I have faith that the Pro Apps will be safe in an iCloud world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a writer in the digital age, my tools are ever changing. I am “that guy” who buys just about every app known to man in hopes of finding a better workflow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; an easier way to translate my thoughts into workable text. Personally, I see no reason to be terminally locked into a single method. Projects and needs change, so too do the tools that help us get things done.</p>

<p>Recently, the software developers The Soulmen released <a href="http://www.the-soulmen.com/daedalus">Daedalus Touch</a>, a plain text editor for the iPad that tries to harness the strongest aspects of touch-based interfaces while keeping their main focus on that one most basic and important task: writing. Gone is the file system and list of available documents. Daedalus tries to make writing on the iPad as un-computer-like as possible. Borrowing Apple’s parlance, the app’s marketing materials tout it as a “post-PC” text editor. It fulfills that role by introducing a (sort of) new paradigm for working with text known as the paper stack.</p>

<p>When you launch Daedalus, you are presented with “stacks” of papers. Each one, in PC terminology, is basically a folder. Swipe left to right to see as many stacks as you have created. Pinch out on a stack and you will reveal all of the “sheets” or documents (if you must) contained therein. Instead of a filename, each sheet features two areas of input: one for your title (which then acts as a filename on your computer) and one for your content. Swipe left to right to see all of your sheets, which extend infinitely toward the bottom of your iPad screen so you can see each one’s full contents. Tap, hold and drag a sheet to re-order your stack to your liking. The interface is extremely slick. It <em>feels</em> like an iPad app, more so than any other text editor that came before it.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times recently revived a monthly Q &amp; A column with co-chief film
critics A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis. Whatever you think of their answers,
they are definitely <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/movies/questions-for-the-film-
critics-scott-and-dargis.html">picking some good
questions</a>. The first question this weekend is about the
unavailability of decent art cinema in the reader’s home town multiplex;
basically a diatribe on how bad studio films have gotten.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The studios have always made filler and junk, but the quality of run-of-the-
mill movies at least had a base competency; if nothing else they were well
lighted, shot and recorded, which isn’t always the case now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dargis hits the nail on the head with the problem of major studio films these
days. Once upon a time they were competent exercises in film language. That’s
just not the case anymore.</p>

<p>The news that Hollywood defeatists (“There’s nothing good to see at the
movies; it’s all kid stuff”) hate to hear is that they are to blame for the
current slate at the multiplex. A.O. Scott offers the medicine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So here’s what you can do: go see Terrence Malick’s “Tree of Life” when it
opens Friday. You may not like it or “get” it, but it is in every way the
opposite of the stale, tedious, market-tested drivel you so rightly complain
about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dubious use of quotation marks aside (if you can watch a film, you can “get”
it) his point is simple: put your money where you mouth is; your ass where the
seats are. Hollywood follows the money. Now that they know they can make more
money off of a cheaper film <em>and</em> that there are filmmakers willing to put
their name on a cobbled together rushed-to-screen blockbuster (I’m looking at
you, Chris Weitz) they’re going to keep doing it until audiences start
demanding a higher class of cinema.</p>

<p>Next up is an even more fascinating question (I may need to break this off
into its own post some other time). Here it is in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do all other art forms laud repetition and exploration of themes
but movies disdain and dismiss them? Monet and his water lilies. Calder and
his mobiles. Dale Chihuly’s instantly recognized work. The new season presents
the same operas and musical compositions it did in the old season. And we’re
celebrating Mark Twain this year because he was Mark Twain. But in movies it’s
a (pejorative) remake, not a (positive) revival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question is on my mind whenever I think of the work of Woody Allen or
Steven Spielberg. When you look at their bodies of work, or even experience
them over the course of a lifetime, you begin to see the threads they are
pulling at, trying to perfect. This repetition of form, in my opinion,
enhances the work.</p>

<p>A better example, perhaps, would be Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who has been going
back to his steam-punk well on almost every outing. His latest <em>Micmacs</em>
hearkens back to his collaboration with Marc Caro on <em>Delicatessen</em>, but it is
still a film that is able to stand on its own. There is no question that it is
a Jeunet work; it’s what you signed up for even if it feels more iterative
than fresh and new. The same goes for the work of Tim Burton or Baz Luhrmann.
It’s not a negative that you can recognize their work from a mile away, but a
sign of their mark, their indelible stamp.</p>

<p>The following question is so-so, regarding what films critics would consider a
primer to begin work in the field of film writing. The final question is about
watching films on mobile phones and other devices, whether or not it is
considered an acceptable format. I have become a proponent of this kind of
viewing, though not for everything. To test my mobile mettle, a few years back
I loaded <em>The Searchers</em> on my iPhone and watched it across five or so subway
rides. The experience was different from watching it on my television or in a
packed movie-house, but so what?</p>

<p>It’s hard to explain. Watching a film while clutching a device is a more
active experience than sitting on a couch while it plays on the television. If
you go limp, you run the risk of dropping your device. I’m much more likely to
pass out watching a film on my couch than I am on the subway, so is it so bad
that I take my media with me? I have no illusions about it; I am fully aware
the experience doesn’t compare to going to the movies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fear is that the coming generation of gadget addicts will prefer
watching films on smaller screens. Hollywood still commands astounding box
office revenues, so <em>someone</em> is going to the movies. Based on the first
inquisitor in the New York Times’ column, it’s probably not older, more
sophisticated audiences that shell out barrels of cash on opening weekend,
it’s the same generation that is supposedly becoming obsessed with mobile
viewing.</p>

<p>I would say that the next generation simply consumes more media than any
before it. They want to wrap themselves up in bits, keeping a film on hand at
all times to stave off boredom. How could that be bad for the cinema? (A
loaded question; let’s revisit it soon.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted a piece over at Toro Magazine today about Lars von Trier’s Cannes
stir. There are a lot of moving parts surrounding the situation that erupted
over his poor-taste comments at the <em>Melancholia</em> press conference. Basically,
I don’t think he’s an anti-Semite or a Nazi and the Cannes board decided to
make an example of him. What’s weird is they don’t tend to make examples of
other criminals and malcontents. A joke gone awry turned into a mess, and
fast.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lars von Trier has long been known as a prankster and provocateur. His films
are bombastic elegies on the erosion of humanity. Even as he brings the rest
of us down (as in Dancer in the Dark, the most depressing musical you’ll ever
see) he never loses his sharp wit. He courts controversy like some kind of
cinematic jester. If it weren’t for his mastery of the form and obvious
brilliance as an artist, perhaps we wouldn’t stand for it. So here he comes to
Cannes and, in a tongue in cheek riff, says he’s a Nazi. The French won’t have
it. But what will the French have?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group will utilize the powerful Flixster
brand and technical expertise to launch a number of initiatives designed to

<p>“Studio-agnostic” my ass. Studios have never successfully launched a piece of
tech to market that is good for consumers or that has any semblance of a
manageable user-experience. Just look at the mess that is Blu-ray, which is
more about bloat than experience, to see what happens when the studios embrace
technology.</p>

<p>Consider this the end of Flixster and Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

  <p>INTERVIEWER &gt; &gt; I notice in your answers to my questions a kind of collage
element. You will often paste in long quotations, and that is also true of
your nonfiction and criticism. Can you explain your attraction to this
technique? &gt; MALCOLM &gt; Well, the most obvious attraction of quotation is that
it gives you a little vacation from writing—the other person is doing the
work. All you have to do is type. But there is a reason beyond sloth for my
liking of quotation at length. It permits you to show the thing itself rather
than the pale, and never quite right, simulacrum that paraphrase is. &gt; &gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from <em>The Paris Review No. 196</em></p>

<p>This interview by Katie Roiphe (available only in print) is full of
interesting bits, but I especially like this flourish on the use of quotation.
I like to share quotes here on the candler blog in part because it stands up
to criticism better than paraphrase, but also because, on a certain level, I
<em>am</em> lazy.</p>

<p>Why should I repeat what has been said better elsewhere? The idea is to
continue and hopefully enhance the conversation.</p>
