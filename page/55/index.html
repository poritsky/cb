  <div class="entry-content"><p>Austin’s Alamo Drafthouse is sure to win over hearts (even mine) <a href="http://drafthouse.com/blog/entry/alamo_drafthouse_unveils_signature_wine_line_the_bottle_of_wits">this Valentine’s Day</a> with a <em>Princess Bride</em>-themed menu to accompany a romantic screening of Rob Reiner’s 1987 film. Perhaps bigger news is that they are also launching two signature wines based on the film (“Inconceivable Cab” and “As You Wish White”). The wine, unlike the menu (which will only serve cinephiles and big-time nerds in Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Texas and Winchester, Virginia), will be available for order online <a href="http://princessbridewine.com/">sometime soon</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing says true love like a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, which is, of course, on the menu. No meal is too difficult for the Alamo kitchen to concoct. I learned this last year when, at a SXSW midnight screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1296373/"><em>The FP</em></a>, the wait staff brought out waffles and SpaghettiOs for everyone. That was an unwelcome surprise straight out of the movie. This, however, looks like a delightful way to spend a holiday that is too often short on cinematic creativity.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Check out the menu (and a clip I couldn’t help embedding) below.</p>

<p>Consider me excited for this “beta” of broadcast monitoring. Sounds like Apple is slowly (very slowly) filling in the gaps they left when they left behind Final Cut 7.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Michael Leddy really liked <em>The Artist</em>. Well, <a href="http://mleddy.blogspot.com/2012/01/artist-and-typography.html">he liked most of it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s only one false touch in the film, and I’m not embarrassed to point it out: the intertitles use straight (“dumb”) quotation marks (<code>" "</code>) around dialogue, not curved (“ ”) quotation marks, aka “book quotes” or “curly quotes” or “smart quotes” or “typographic quotation marks.” Glance through an assortment of <a href="http://silentintertitles.tumblr.com/">silent-film intertitles</a> and it’s easy to see that proper quotation marks were the norm.</p>
  <footer><strong>-Michael Leddy</strong> <cite><a href="http://mleddy.blogspot.com/2012/01/artist-and-typography.html">Orange Crate Art</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Technically, he’s right. Not all, but a great many silent films did use curly quotes, especially those that survive to this day. However, I think this kind of niggling misses the point of <em>The Artist</em>. Director Michel Hazanavicius is such a cinematic nerd I have little doubt his typographical choice was deliberate (unlike <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/01/25/brad-bird-responds-to-typographer/">Brad Bird’s</a>), or at the very least, considered.</p>

<p><em>The Artist</em> may be a silent film about the silent age, but formally it is cut from the anachronistic cloth of the 1940s and 1950s. Hazanavicius makes this as clear as possible with allusions to Citizen Kane and the <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/press-plays-vertigoed-contest-and-the-winners-are">now infamous</a> use of Bernard Herrmann’s <em>Vertigo</em> score. Historicity is the last thing he is trying to sell.</p>

<p>I am now left to wonder, however, what was the point of using “straight” or “dumb” quotes? If I concede that the director did so intentionally, surely he had a reason. Perhaps it was a statement on the utilitarianism of post-modernity; that the curlicued flourishes of yesteryear have washed away with the career of the film’s protagonist, George Valentin. Sure, we have our own forms of frippery leftover (tap-dancing and puppies) but in the end the machines have won. Our punctuation is without personality.</p>

<p>Or there’s nothing to this at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>David Bordwell’s <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/index.php?s=pandora%27s+digital+box">growing series</a> on the move from 35mm film to digital projection is absolutely stellar reading. In today’s entry, he tracks what the changeover is like for art house cinemas:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s comparatively easy for chains like Regal and AMC, which control 12,000 screens (nearly one-third of the US and Canadian total), to make the digital switchover efficiently. Solid capitalization and investment support, economies of scale, and cooperation with manufacturers allow the big chains to afford the upgrade. But what about other kinds of exhibition?</p><footer><strong>-David Bordwell</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/01/30/pandoras-digital-box-art-house-smart-house/">Pandora’s Digital Box: Art House, Smart House</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>The long piece includes crack reporting from the Art House Convergence that took place just before Sundance this year. By my read, Bordwell offers the clearest, most extensive account of the state of the digital transition available today.</p>

<p>One thing I didn’t know is that the major studios are attaching all sorts of requirements to theaters that accept a subsidy in order to hasten the transition to the Digital Cinema Package (DCP) format.</p>

<blockquote><p>More constraints appear if the exhibitor chooses to fund the changeover through the Virtual Print Fee. For example, VPFs oblige the exhibitor to screen only films supplied by the major companies–the ones that created the Digital Cinema Initiatives. If an exhibitor wants to play an independent distributor’s title on a DCP, that distributor needs to pay the fee, in effect helping to cover the theatre’s conversion. Other constraints are more obscure. I can’t report reliably on them because when joining a VPF program, the exhibitor signs a non-disclosure agreement pledging not to reveal details of the deal. But hints suggest that exhibitors could be prevented from “splitting,” that is showing two or more films in the same auditorium on one day. This is a practice that many art cinemas rely on because it allows them to vary programs in mid-week, or to compensate for having only one or two screens.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first sign of danger, in my opinion, is that the studios (who comprise the Digital Cinema Initiatives, or DCI, which oversees the DCP format) require a non-disclosure agreement at all. Sure, it’s their right, but they’re effectively the only game in town. What are they hiding?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/01/waves-still.jpg" title="Still from “Waves (Response to a Blog Post)”" /></p>

<p>I’d like to talk about Daniel Anderson’s short video essay, “Waves (Response to a Blog Post),” which he released a week ago on Vimeo. First, let’s take a look at it, shall we?</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/35552232?portrait=0" width="551" height="413" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>I first watched this film on my television, comfortably sitting on my couch. I tensed up almost immediately, succumbing to a kind of claustrophobia. This digital work, this “screencast,” is something I relate to viscerally. As a writer and, particularly, as a blogger, “Waves” illustrates the work I do on computers in a way I hadn’t conceived of before. It’s…frightening.</p>

<p>Here is Mr. Anderson’s description of the film:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is my response to the blog posting, The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality. See the mantra: you don’t study digital composing, you perform it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post in question was published on January 9 by <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/">Stanley Fish at the New York Times</a>. In it he discusses scholarship in the digital age and why he has opted to reframe his “column” as a “blog.” He ends his piece with a question or, perhaps, a challenge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pertinent challenge to this burgeoning field has been issued by one of its pioneer members, Jerome McGann of the University of Virginia. “The general field of humanities education and scholarship will not take up the use of digital technology in any significant way until one can clearly demonstrate that these tools have important contributions to make to the exploration and explanation of aesthetic works” (“<a href="http://www.ivanhoegame.org/">Ivanhoe Game</a> Summary,” 2002). What might those contributions be? Are they forthcoming? These are the questions I shall take up in the next column, oops, I mean blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Waves” appears to be the answer to that loaded question. Consider what the film is: it’s a window onto the desktop of a scholar who is mashing up and remixing the work of others in almost every conceivable way. The text, the music, the videos, the applications and even the graphical interface itself are wholly unoriginal, conceived not by the filmmaker but by other artists. Any one of us could replicate the work that Anderson performs in his film, but why would we?</p>

<p>Taking it further, we can talk about the way that Anderson released this work into the world. It was uploaded to Vimeo, where many would be watching it on a computer screen. The experience changes if you watch it on a tablet or on a television; it is completely different if you watch it windowed or fullscreen; and the experience of watching this either on a Mac or a Windows machine alters the viewer’s perspective even further. The portal through which we view the work completely changes the experience. If the challenge is that scholarship will ignore digital technology “until one can clearly demonstrate that these tools have important contributions to make to the exploration and explanation of aesthetic works,” then I’d say that burden has been met.</p>

<p>I spend a great deal of time in front of screens. When I’m not in front of a computer, I am usually watching television or tapping away on my iPad or iPhone. Digital tools surround me because I like them and they enhance the way I work and live. No matter what the screen, I am always aware of my surroundings. The coins and papers on my desk, the subway train on which I clack away on my iPad, the park from which I am tweeting, etc. The screencast, however, disembodies the act of making a digital work. Anderson’s film feels corpse-like, a computer almost running itself for its own amusement and gains. Like I said, it is frightening, but I can’t look away.</p>

<p>According to his <a href="http://iamdananderson.net/">Web site</a>, Daniel Anderson is an English professor at the University of North Carolina where he studies “new media composing and instructional technology.” His aim here may have been academic, but I would argue that the outcome is entirely cinematic. There are a severe amount of interpretations that “Waves” is open to which only adds to the joy of experiencing it. Plop ten people down in front of this film and you’ll get at least ten different explanations, maybe more. Now that’s cinema.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night on Reddit, redditor <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Shiftia">Shiftia</a> took to the site to open a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p18qa/iama_movie_theater_projectionist_in_a_few_weeks/">conversation about the death of film projection</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>IAMA movie theater projectionist. In a few weeks, my job will no longer exist.</p><p>In less than a month, all theaters are being forced to use purely digital projectors. Projection itself has become a dying art.</p><p>Feel free to ask me anything about projection, movies, or working at a theater in general! :)</p></blockquote>

<p>770 comments at the time I’m posting this and still growing. The top comment is by a digital projectionist who points out that there is still an art to operating new, digital projectors.</p>

<blockquote><p>As someone who worked in a digital projection multiplex&#8230; your job isn&#8217;t going to be gone for long.</p><p>A multitude of things can go wrong with digital projectors&#8230; they&#8217;re computers!</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am happy to announce that the candler blog is now a part of the InfluAds advertising network. You may have gotten the impression that I hate ads when I took <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/16/on-hulu-and-respect/">Hulu to task</a> recently, but that’s not the case. I hate crappy content, and ads are undeniably content.</p>

<p>When I started the candler blog back in 2009, I signed up for Google Adsense. I had zero control over what which ad appeared on my site and limited options to determine what it looked like. For most of the time I had a Google Adsense ad on my site, it actually didn’t fit in my sidebar, but I left there because, hey, I needed the money.</p>

<p>Only I never got a check from Google. The rates Google pays make it difficult for a small site to reach the minimum for them to cut a check. You can game the system by covering your site in ads but that’s not why I started doing this. Fed up, I killed the ad.</p>

<p>InfluAds is different. They call themselves “The Quality-Only Advertising Network” and, so far, I think that’s a pretty apt description. It’s simple: one good-looking ad per page. No obtrusive banners, no whack-a-mole animation, no “stay at home mom discovers weight loss secret” bullshit. They even give me some design control over the ad. Everything but the graphic itself can be modified with CSS, so <strong>I can make the ad look the way I want it to.</strong> It is my site, after all.</p>

<p>And that’s it. Editorially, nothing is changing around here. The only thing the advertisers want me to do is to make the best site I can. As I’ve said before, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/13/the-story-i-want-to-tell/">I hope I’m up to it</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Meanwhile, at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/01/27/comedian-rob-corddry-talks-about-how-macs-helped-dig-him-out-of-a-creative-hole/">Macworld</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of much interest to Corddry was the fact that developer Brett Terpstra, Jonathan Poritsky, Stu Maschwitz and Martin Vilcans on bringing Stu’s Screenplay Markdown proposal to his popular Markdown editor Marked. Terpstra announced, in a quick back-and-forth with Corddry that they were also working on getting a Markdown exporter working for Final Draft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, now that’s exciting! I can’t say I’m surprised. It was Corddry who, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/08/17/back-to-work-29/">in conversation with Merlin Mann</a>, said, “We are slaves to the worst piece of software ever created: Final Draft.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whoa:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Oscars are looming. So we thought it might be great to produce some amazing, hand-curated data on Hollywood films.</p><p>Our ultra-comprehensive dataset lifts the lid on opening weekends, worldwide gross, budgets, storylines, review scores – everything – <strong>for every Hollywood film released in the last five years</strong>.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Our challenge to you is, as ever, VISUALIZE.</p><footer><strong>The Information is Beautiful Awards</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/">2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>The fine geeks at Information is Beautiful have culled data on every film released since 2007 from <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/">The Numbers</a>, <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/">Box Office Mojo</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>. They’ve placed it all nice and neat into a <a href="http://bit.ly/hollywoodbudgets">Google Docs spreadsheet</a>. Entrants have until February 6th to take the data and either create a static graphical representation of it or build a webapp.</p>

<p>If my <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/12/31/2011-box-office-in-review/">2011 Box Office in Review</a> didn’t tip you off, I love playing with data. When I was parsing out the numbers myself, I created a spreadsheet on my own and it took forever. This dataset is nice to have even if you don’t want to make a neat infographic out of it. But you do; obviously you do.</p>

<p>They <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2012/hollywood-budgets-extended-deadline/">extended the contest deadline</a> to widen the pool of entrants:</p>

<blockquote><p>We’ve had loads of great entries already. And some amazingly creative ideas are popping up.</p><p>Like, <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2012/01/23/hollywood-data/">Jermone Cukier</a>‘s explorations of the dollar value of individual features of a plot. He cross-referenced keywords for each movie on IMDb with box office return. The result? A price tag for each plot element.</p><p>Having an explosion in your film could earn you $150m, he finds. A love triangle $37m. And a psychopath – just $32m.</p></blockquote>

<p>I cannot begin to explain how excited I am to see what people come up with. I may have to enter myself.</p>
