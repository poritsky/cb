<blockquote>
  <p>If a site consistently links to Kottke or Daring Fireball, then that site’s market share is going to get pretty small. Most people are either already reading Kottke and Gruber or a hundred other sites will link to them anyway. But if I find a site that links to something truly out of the ordinary, I’m going to give them some of my attention. If they say smart things about those links I’ll probably give them a great deal of my attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I link therefore I am.</p>

<p>Wait…no. Scratch that. I write link posts because I like to.</p>

<p>When I stop to ponder this site’s place in the grand fabric of the Internet I usually slow down posting (which may give you a little insight as to how I’ve been spending my January).</p>

<p>So instead of wondering why I write link posts I’d rather get back to piecing together <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/13/the-story-i-want-to-tell/">the story I want to tell</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Speaking of <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/01/29/eagle-hox-funds-tuition/">lessons in monetizing video content</a>, here’s Jason Del Rey <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/">at Ad Age</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>YouTube has reached out to a small group of channel producers and asked them to submit applications to create channels that users would have to pay to access. As of now it appears that the first paid channels will cost somewhere between $1 and $5 a month, two of these people said. In addition to episodic content, YouTube is also considering charging for content libraries and access to live events, a la pay-per-view, as well as self-help or financial advice shows.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/19/vimeo-monetization/">Vimeo’s Tip Jar and forthcoming pay-to-view service</a>? Like I said back in September, 2013 is shaping up to be a big year in this space.</p>

  <p>The viral video of the eagle, which was created by students at Montreal’s Centre NAD, has received international media attention and had more than 41 million views on YouTube since it was posted on Dec. 18.</p>

  <p>And the school says it’s also generated a few bucks that will go toward a scholarship for a deserving student at the 3D animation and digital design school.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/">Courier Prime</a> is a new typeface from Alan Dague-Greene created for John August and Quote-Unquote Apps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the beginning, screenplays have been written in Courier. Its uniformity allows filmmakers to make handy comparisons and estimates, such as 1 page = 1 minute of screen time.</p>

  <p>But there’s no reason Courier has to look terrible. We set out to make the best damn Courier ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes only an instant to see that it’s the best damn free Courier around. The italic lowercase “i” and “f” in particular are a beautiful touch none of the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/11/which-courier/">alternatives</a> possess.</p>

<p>I’ve been using Kris Sowersby’s <a href="http://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/">Pitch</a> as my monospace of choice these last few months (I’m a sucker for that double-story lowercase “g”) but it’s a pricy typeface. Courier Prime is gorgeous, well thought out, available in all essential weights (Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic) and best of all free. <a href="http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/">Go get it</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE:</em></strong> John August’s post introducing Courier Prime is definitely <a href="http://johnaugust.com/2013/introducing-courier-prime">worth a read</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks once again to the New York Film Academy for sponsoring the candler blog this past week.</em></p>

<p>Has the proliferation of documentaries, reality TV and faux-documentary television programming (e.g.,
NBC-TV’s The Office) in any way diminished the film-journalism genre?</p>

<p>It doesn’t appear to be the case. If anything, the appetite for non-fictional video narratives is on the
increase: No fewer than 20 top-tier cable television channels carry documentaries 24/7 in the U.S.,
while online cyber-docs and webisodes offer additional and unlimited distribution venues. The
spectacular success of documentary filmmakers Marilyn Agrelo, Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock now
illustrate that big audiences like and respond to documentaries.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/documentary-school/" rel="nofollow">Documentary School</a> at the
New York Film Academy’s 6-week, one-year and Master of Fine Arts programs provide more than a vocational
education to its very international student body. Aspiring documentarians are exposed to some of the
biggest names in documentaries who visit the program, lecture and provide real-world learning
experiences for students. These budding filmmakers hear first-hand about the power that documentaries
have on <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/" rel="nofollow">education</a> and social change – launching
fulfilling careers, documenting the world as they see it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is just a general practice for both Facebook and Instagram to request photo IDs for verification purposes depending on what type of violation may have occurred,” a spokesperson for Facebook told TPM. “Unfortunately, I can’t share more with you beyond that as we don’t go into details beyond that.”</p>

  <p>Facebook declined to state exactly why a number of users would collectively receive notifications to provide government issued IDs this week or what specific violations of terms prompted the notifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</p>

<p>I’ll admit that when I <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/12/18/instagone/">nuked my Instagram account</a> recently I worried that maybe I should loosen my tin-foil hat a bit, but this makes my trepidation that they’d sell my photos seem quaint.</p>

<p>No Web service is worth this kind of intrusion into your private life; no private company should insist on seeing a government issued ID and not be able to tell you why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kitchen utensil and houseware maker OXO came under fire last week from rival company Quirky. The dispute was over the design of a dustpan with teeth, with Quirky claiming OXO lifted the idea from their designer.</p>

<p>Looks more like an ad-campaign in hidsight now, though, with Quirky painting itself as a defender of original design across social media. <a href="http://www.oxo.com/quirkyresponse.aspx">OXO took to their corporate site to respond</a> with a devastating defense of the product in question and some words of advice to inventors the world over.</p>

<p>On patents, they had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideas are limitless and patents expire for a reason: to encourage competition, innovation, and the evolution of new ideas that ultimately benefit the end user. If patents never expired, we would have only one car company, and the cars they develop would likely not be readily available and affordable to so many people all over the world. Imagine that.</p>

  <p>At OXO, we either invent or improve. In this instance, we improved upon Mr. Kelley’s patent. Many other innovators do this as well. Apple did not invent the Walkman. They did not invent the cell phone. They did not invent the tablet computer. Their designers improved each and now millions of people enjoy the fruits of their improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The patent in question belongs to Addison F. Kelley, and it expired in 1936.</p>

<p>I’d say Quirky’s social media campaign just failed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some inside the network argued that its reporters — who had initially been put onto the story by Tom Condon, Te’o’s agent — had enough material to justify publishing an article. Others were less sure and pushed to get an interview with Te’o, something that might happen as soon as the next day. For them, it was a question of journalistic standards. They did not want to be wrong.</p>

  <p>“We were very close,” said Vince Doria, ESPN’s chief for news. “We wanted to be very careful.”</p>

  <p>ESPN held the story, and then lost it.</p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20. They wanted an exclusive interview to break the news, so they waited. And they blew it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, no, we have no choice but to be scared. The thing is, terrors like cancer or bankruptcy or loneliness can’t be outrun. You can’t get on your bike and fly down a dark road, adrenalin spiking, desperately hoping to leave them behind. They’re on the bike <em>with</em> you, riding on the saddle while you stand on the pedals, with their claws holding firmly to your jacket, and their smile is more like a silent scream. Fear is our co-pilot, and always will be.</p>

  <p>That’s why we need a substitute; a surrogate thing-from-the-graveyard. Something we can deal with directly, and that we can <em>escape</em>. Maybe something with claws, and wings, that can move impossibly fast. For me, that’s what spooky stories are about - what’s dismissively called “horror fiction”, and more properly (in my opinion) called supernatural literature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks to the New York Film Academy for sponsoring the candler blog this week.</em></p>

<p>Do you think video games are all about smash, shoot, bash and run? If you do, please rethink.</p>

<p>Digital games are now used by at least 135 million Americans at least once a month. Many are in the
action thriller genre, but one-on-one and one-on-many games across all available digital formats –
including and especially mobile smartphones and tablets – have gone way beyond. The growth of games such
as Words With Friends and “serious” games used in schools, in workplaces and for military training are
the new explosion in gaming.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/game-design-school/" rel="nofollow">Game Design School</a> at the New
York Film Academy is training the next generation of game designers. With degrees at the Associates,
Bachelors and Masters levels, as well as a one-year conservatory program, the school turns game
enthusiasts into game leaders.</p>

<p>Operated within a performing <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/" rel="nofollow">arts school</a>, the NYFA
game design program includes a class in improvisational acting. Why? Improv is much like interactive
game play.</p>
