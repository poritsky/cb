  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quentin Hardy reporting on Intel <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/technology/intel-downgrades-sales-expectations.html">for The New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company, often cited as a bellwether for technology firms, also said the worsening market meant its gross profit margin would fall to 62 percent, from an earlier expectation of 63 percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bummer. But what do the analysts think?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PC market has been weak for much of the year, but analysts had previously expected a recovery in the final quarter, after Microsoft releases a new version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 8. The new version of Windows has been delayed from its original release date.</p>

  <p>In addition, Intel had hoped to take on the growing market for tablet computers, which today often do not use Intel chips, with lightweight laptop computers called ultrabooks. Few of these have hit the market yet, however, and sales have been modest relative to tablets like Apple’s iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight: Windows 8’s delay, the slow start of the “ultrabook” market and the runaway success of the iPad are bringing down the world’s largest chip-maker’s bottom line, and yet it’s <em>Intel</em> that’s the industry bellwether? Got it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember reading Ben Brooks’s <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/failure/">takedown of <em>The Verge</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in December and thinking he was on to something, but that I wasn’t quite ready to call bullshit on the site and its writers. Now I am.</p>

<p>It’s been a bad week for <a href="http://www.theverge.com/"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the tech news clearinghouse started by former-Engadget staffers last year and part of the growing <a href="http://www.voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> empire. With a slick “magazine-like” layout and loads of ways to interact with the site, the team there has undoubtedly built an incredible online presence. Their video content is second-to-none, their forums are full of informed nerdy-types and their long-form feature pieces look amazing in a Web browser. The trouble is the content itself, which this week proved to be weak, shameful, unconscionable or all of the above. So I’m done with them.</p>

<h3 id="weak">Weak</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/verge-hed-1.jpg" title="The Paperwhite &#34;Exclusive&#34;" alt="The Paperwhite &#34;Exclusive&#34;" /></p>

<p>Let’s start with the pieces leading up to Amazon’s Kindle announcement this week. The first red flag for me was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3280770/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-display/in/3061995">this August 30th piece</a> by Chris Ziegler with the headline “Exclusive: meet the Amazon Kindle with ‘Paperwhite’ backlit display.” I was excited to see this headline because, well <em>The Verge</em> is a big-time outlet and Chris, who I’ve been reading for years, is a real-deal tech journalist. So I was confused when I got to the page and saw 200 words with an image gallery containing seven images, each with “<em>The Verge</em>” burned into the corner.</p>

<p>My first problem was the use of the word exclusive. I’m used to film outlets abusing the term, but I wasn’t prepared for <em>The Verge</em> to play fast and loose with it. To me, and really to english-speaking readers the world over, exclusive in a headline means more than just images, but analysis and original writing you won’t find anywhere else. And the rest of the headline? When I “meet” a new device I usually get more than some pics and a glorified caption.</p>

<p>Worst of all was Ziegler’s content, which said nothing. Where did the images come from? How did <em>The Verge</em> obtain them? Why aren’t they in English? Nothing. Not even a passing reference. Which is everything. When I didn’t see any form of sourcing in the short piece, my first thought was that Amazon “leaked” the images to <em>The Verge</em>, and if that’s the case, then, as journalists, they failed me as a reader. If they have a source and a scoop they have an obligation to share as much information as they can get their hands on.</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I am not accusing Ziegler or <em>The Verge</em> of regurgitating a fake leak from Amazon. However, without their own explanation of the images’ provenance, as a reader I am left to my own devices to assume where they came from. Without anything of value in Chris’s copy, what am I to think?</p>

<h3 id="shameful">Shameful</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/verge-hed-2.jpg" title="The Amazon Phone &#34;Exclusive&#34;" alt="The Amazon Phone &#34;Exclusive&#34;" /></p>

<p>Then came <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/5/3294569/exclusive-amazon-phone-confirmed-could-be-announced-tomorrow">Nilay Patel’s head-scratcher</a> this past Wednesday: “Exclusive: Amazon phone confirmed, could be announced tomorrow.” This heavy-handed (and impossible) headline was followed by a mere 182 words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multiple sources have confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that Amazon is working on a smartphone that runs a variant of the Kindle Fire’s Android-based operating system, and we’re now hearing that the device will be shown to the press tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That headline is shameful. It treats us, as readers, like complete idiots whose clicks need to be bilked out of us at all costs. The “Exclusive” at the front is annoying even if warranted (though of course I would like to read a more in depth-piece). The trouble is that the headline indicates two different pieces of information that aren’t exactly backed up in Patel’s copy, and one of which isn’t confirmed at all.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about that confirmation for a moment. The headline says, “Amazon phone confirmed,” but the piece says “Multiple sources have confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that Amazon is working on a smartphone.” <em>Working</em>. Nilay is, ostensibly, confirming nothing. Companies work on all kinds of devices that never see the light of day. Patel squandered a more interesting angle (<em>what</em> are they working on?) to get a flashy headline out there.</p>

<p>And that whole “could be” thing? I don’t think I need to explain why saying, consecutively, “confirmed, could be” needs to be explained away. And the copy says “we’re now hearing that the device will be shown to the press tomorrow,” which sounds like as much of a confirmation as the angle on the phone’s existence. So the piece doesn’t even back up the headline.</p>

<p>Why does this bother me? Alone, it’s a sad case of link-bait, but combine it with Ziegler’s previous “exclusive” and the hamster in my head gets back on his wheel. How does one outlet get two non-starter exclusives from the same company in one week? The only conclusion I can think of is that Amazon is leaking them stories they want out there. Again, I have no proof of this and this is not an accusation. But <em>The Verge</em> isn’t giving me a better narrative. </p>

<h3 id="unconscionable">Unconscionable</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/verge-hed-3.jpg" title="The Looper Hyperbole" /></p>

<p>Finally, yesterday afternoon <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3295978/film-review-looper">Bryan Bishop published the most hyperbolic headline yet</a>: “Film review: ‘Looper’ reinvents the sci-fi film with a mix of humanity and adventure.” It’s all fun and games when <em>The Verge</em> disappoints me while covering the tech space, but now they’re covering movies too?</p>

<p>I’ll be seeing the film soon at Fantastic Fest and I’m avoiding reviews, so I haven’t read Bishop’s take, but the headline is preposterous on its face because he isn’t a film critic <em>and</em> he’s not writing for a film outlet. As such, it’s impossible to trust his word that a film could reinvent any genre.</p>

<p>Annoying. But it gets worse.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half after publication, <em>Verge</em> reader “slipslip” posted <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3295978/film-review-looper#113773349">this comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since it is somewhat unusual for The Verge to review and cover movies (even sci-fi ones), it seems like it might be appropriate for Bryan to add a “full disclosure” addendum to the article about his personal friendship with the director, which I believe was mentioned in The Verge’s post featuring the interview with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bishop concurred:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I agree, slipslip, I’ve just added one. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And added this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Full disclosure: Bryan Bishop and Mr. Johnson attended college together, a topic we discuss in our interview with the director.]<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, it’s discouraged for film critics to do interview pieces for films they plan to review, even when they didn’t go to college with the filmmaker. Secondly, “thanks for the suggestion”? On what planet is disclosure a suggestion? Bishop had an obligation to tell the readers his relationship to the filmmaker from the get-go, and no, linking to another piece where he drops that bit of info (and not in a disclosure, mind you) doesn’t count.</p>

<p>Do I need to do the math on this? <em>The Verge</em> doesn’t regularly do movie reviews. When they do it’s a glowing review of one their News Manager’s college pals. This is more than dubious, it’s downright scandalous. Shame on the site’s entire staff for allowing this to be published under their logo without disclosure.</p>

<h3 id="im-done">I’m Done</h3>

<p>The journalistic standards <em>The Verge’s</em> staff have displayed in the past week have been, collectively, the last straw. I don’t need the site in my life to begin with, but they have now broken the one thing a news outlet must preserve in order to keep a reader: trust. I have lost faith in the endeavor completely; I can’t trust anything I read on the site anymore.</p>

<p>So I’m done with <em>The Verge</em>. They may not miss one reader. That’s fine. I won’t miss them either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/kindle.jpg" title="Whispersync for Voice" /></p>

<p>Amazon introduced a slew of new tablets and e-readers yesterday. If you want to learn more about them, I recommend checking our their product pages, because I’m not going to discuss them here.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/RjAD9X">New Kindle</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/OW0VeJ">Kindle Paperwhite</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/Q9mbgB">Kindle Fire HD</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/SqgsZu">Kindle Fire HD 8.9”</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="its-the-software-stupid">It’s the Software, Stupid</h3>

<p>At yesterday’s press event, there was a slide that exemplified what it is that makes Amazon. “Invention does not stop with the hardware.” Amazon is, first and foremost, a software company. Hardware, really any physical aspect of selling goods, is an obstacle Jeff Bezos and friends seek to mitigate.</p>

<p>First Amazon took over the book-selling industry, then they took over selling everything else. Now, as our lives move into the digital realm, they want to sell bits, every bit, really. Bezos put it best: <strong>“We want to make money when people <em>use</em> our devices, not when they <em>buy</em> our devices.”</strong></p>

<p>This mantra makes it clear as day what it is that separates them from Apple, who wants to sell you devices, Microsoft, who wants to sell you software licenses, and Google, who wants to sell you to advertisers. Amazon’s prime directive is to sell you content, and the only way they can do that is if you have devices on which to experience them.</p>

<h3 id="shh">Shh</h3>

<p>The backbone of Amazon’s digital machinations is called Whispersync<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Initially, all Whispersync could do was keep all of your Kindle devices on the same page. Do a little reading on your e-ink Kindle, then open up Kindle for iPhone and (boom) the furthest read page would be in sync. In my experience, this syncing has worked well enough,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> but the secret sauce is in Amazon’s ecosystem of apps. No matter what kind of smartphone, tablet, computer or Web Browser you have, you’re likely able to access your entire Kindle library and keep everything you’re reading in sync.</p>

<p>And today, Amazon expanded their range of sync services with two new offerings: Whispersync for Voice and Whispersync for Games.</p>

<h3 id="glossing-over-games">Glossing Over Games</h3>

<p>Whispersync for Games is basically iOS Game Center or Xbox Live but for games you buy on your Kindle. Got it? Great.</p>

<h3 id="digital-immersion">Digital Immersion</h3>

<p>Whispersync for Voice is very cool. Watch the video:</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ujWsgmdal58" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In short, it keeps your page in sync across not only Kindle books, but their Audible audiobook counterpart. This calls for a hearty <em>finally</em>. After all, Amazon owns Audible, it was only a matter of time.</p>

<p>I have long wanted this feature. I don’t listen to audiobooks often, but in my experience I prefer listening to non-fiction when I do. The trouble is that most non-fiction that I read (or hear) usually contains little bits of information I would like to someday reference. With ebooks I can search the text for what I’m looking for, and with a physical book I can usually feel my to the right passage. But with an audiobook? In one ear and out the other. Once the Whispersync for Voice library grows, I think I’ll actually get back into audiobooks again.</p>

<p>But this innovation points to much more than a boon to my edge-case quirkiness.</p>

<p>There are a handful of really annoying buzzwords that have been floating around the past few years. Second Screen Experience! Social TV! Basically, viewers are using a second screen (iPad, laptop or smartphone) while they watch television. Media companies are trying to figure out how to get their full attention on more than one screen at a time (usually to them sell hair cream and laundry detergent). It’s still the wild west, but I think Amazon has cracked part of the nut, here.</p>

<p>Most second screen implementations, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SquGfDqaRhA">Microsoft’s Xbox Smart Glass</a>, focus on enhancing the primary content with extras on your tablet.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Whispersync for Voice is different because users are actually buying two complete products, two different versions of the same book that they can use with or without its counterpart. That, I think, is something that is actually <em>useful</em> for consumers.</p>

<p>The possibilities for this kind of content syncing are endless, though some may seem more outlandish than others. Imagine, for example, being able to watch a film and have the screenplay stay in sync in front of you on your Kindle. Consider being able to tie the disparate strands of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe together by being able to sync up the story-lines of the films and books, or at least keep them readily accessible if ever timings overlap. Or perhaps sync up relevant film history books to the film you are currently watching.</p>

<p>Not everything Amazon does is a success (remember Silk?), but I have trouble believing consumers will shun Whispersync for Voice. My hope is that it becomes prevalent enough that content makers, of all formats, will be able to put together packages that will make media consumption of the future look like, well, the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://furbo.org/2012/09/05/the-first-apple-channel/">Craig Hockenberry</a> is one astute dude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the month of September, Apple is letting customers view live shows through a combination of <a href="http://www.itunesfestival.com/gb/live">apps, the web, and Apple TV</a>. It’s the fourth year of the <a href="http://londonist.com/2012/09/live-music-preview-itunes-festival-2012.php">iTunes Festival in London</a>, but this is the first year that it’s been broadcast via iTunes. […]</p>

  <p>Could this be akin to HBO creating premium content for it’s subscribers? Or Netflix producing its own shows to make it’s streaming service more desirable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smart.</p>

<p>I don’t see a world where Apple cuts Netflix-sized checks for original content, but I do see one where filmmakers <em>give</em> Apple their content in exchange for access to the vast iTunes audience. Just look at the Podcasting community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mysterious kogonada, who has been anonymously posting supercuts/video essays to Vimeo all year, most recently “<a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/08/29/kubrick-supercut/">Kubrick // One-Point Perspective</a>,” was kind enough to talk with me for a piece <a href="http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/supercut-film-school-qa-with-anonymous-video-essayist-kogonada">over at The Creators Project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How did you come upon this form?</strong><br />
I never really came upon it specifically. I think, like everyone, I’ve noticed that online videos have become increasingly more original and engaging. In the past, there’s never been a popular place for short pieces, outside of commercials and music videos. They existed in museums or film festivals, but now more than ever there’s an appetite and a place for shorts, whether they’re narratives, docs, essays, experimental pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the whole thing. Kogonada has a unique perspective on cinema and the Internet, I could talk to him<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> all day.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>We conversed over email. I honestly have no idea if Kogonada is a man or a woman, but I can only go so long without using a pronoun.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year since I started the candler blog I make the foolhardy decision to redesign the site, almost <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/10/more-than-a-new-design/">like clockwork around New Years</a>. This year I even went so far as to switch from Wordpress to Octopress. Well, I don’t know why but I recently felt the need to change things up around here a bit.</p>

<p>Maybe I felt that <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/07/06/goodbye-new-york/">moving halfway across the country</a> wasn’t enough of a change. Maybe I was jealous that Gabe over at Macdrifter was having <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/moving-to-pelican-design-planning.html">all the static redesigning fun</a>. I don’t know. But I do know that Monday’s post, “<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/03/practice/">Practice Makes Better</a>,” was the result of me trying to pump myself up to finally take on the challenge of moving things around here. For the longest time I figured that, if the site is working as-is, why mess with it? Because I can, because I want to and because, if and when I break it, I can always fix it.</p>

<p>So, welcome to the new candler blog. And if this is your first time joining, please take a look at what it looked like this morning:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/old-design.jpg" title="Old Candler Design" /></p>

<p>I know there are parts of the site that may look off for now. If you run into any problems or have suggestions, please don’t hesitate to let me know in the comments or <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/contact">in an email</a>.</p>

<p>And please enjoy the site. Plenty more to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was growing up, my father was the drummer in a wedding and Bar Mitzvah band. At their peak the band played 60-70 gigs a year, mostly on weekends. That’s a lot of challah.</p>

<p>I used to go on gigs with him. I’d don my little tux and learn the ropes of the whole “I’m with the band” ethos: getting there early to see social halls and gymnasiums transformed into luxurious party rooms, scoring franks in a blanket<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and scarfing them out by a loading dock, watch grown adults act like children whining about the music being too loud, etc. My dad let me play all manor of small instruments, like the tambourine or maracas, anything that made a bit of noise but wouldn’t bring down the whole affair if I screwed up.</p>

<p>Once I got older, it was time to learn my own instrument. At first I tried the drums, but I quit after only a few lessons.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Instead I chose what I (correctly) believed to be the coolest of all instruments: the saxophone. In fourth grade I started playing alto sax.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Once I was able to make it through a freilach, I started bringing it with me to gigs.</p>

<p>Now, I was pretty good. I could read the music and feel the beat, plus these were Jewish standards I grew up with, so all it took was a phrase or two for me to get in the groove and start noodling. In our basement, playing along with a cassette tape, I could power through most of the band’s regular set. It was in public that I had trouble.</p>

<p>I guess you could say I had stage fright. The trouble with playing Bar Mitzvahs, as I explained to my father, was that I was worried I would ruin the party. If I missed a note I would probably just stop, but what if I started honking nonsense? Wouldn’t it cause some kind of aural damage to the guests and possibly spoil an otherwise joyous occasion?</p>

<p>My dad told me to calm down and listen to the keyboardist play a song. He was one of my dad’s childhood friends and part of the reason the band had survived three decades. In my eyes, he was everything a keyboardist should be and more. But I took a moment to listen closely to his performance and noticed something: he messed up, a lot. He’d miss notes or fat-finger some extra keys. His voice was decent but inconsistent and had a limited range; if ever he had to hold a note, he’d wobble in and out of tune. But if he made a mistake he’d just keep going and get back on track.</p>

<p>From then on, I got a little bolder with how many songs I would play at events, and I started playing louder. I even went so far as to start improvising, jazzing up the hora just a bit. When I made mistakes I kept going, and as a result I became a better musician.</p>

<p>Everything I do is a process. This site is a process. I will fail many times, but what’s important is what I do with those failures. On the sax, I learned to keep going into the next phrase and get better. If I stopped playing, then I stopped being a part of the band, and that was always the bigger failure.</p>

      <p>I can still play, but in general I don’t, a fact I constantly regret. Perhaps I should break it out again and challenge <a href="http://macsparky.com/2011/8/22/mpu-55-lonely-sandwich-and-5by5.html">David Sparks</a> to a duel.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
