  <div class="entry-content"><p>I landed at Will Rogers Aiport here in Oklahoma City at around 10:00pm last
night, which was just late enough for me to miss the outdoor screening of
Bradley Beesley’s <em>Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo</em>. We pulled up to a closed
off street in downtown Oklahoma City. People in lawn chairs listened
attentively as Mr. Beesley, a local filmmaker, answered questions alongside
his the stars of the documentary. It was a crowd hit, and the party that
followed was abuzz with praise. I won’t be able to see it until tomorrow
evening, but I am very excited to check it out.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/3617844768_82d498f498_b.jpg" alt="Film in Oklahoma Sticker" />Most of today has been
spent driving around in search or Route 66 which seems to have eluded myself
and my gracious host. I’m told that the infamous interstate is known to do
this, showing itself only when needed. That photograph of a Colorado ad taped
over with the word Oklahoma, was taken on the set of <em>The Killer Inside Me</em>, a
new Michael Winterbottom film being shot here. The sticker, which is on the
back of a lighting truck, somewhat sums up the kind of film community that
thrives out here. Oklahoma has a long history of not being other places. While
sipping a Maker’s and soda at a cigar bar, a local told me that Oklahomans are
much like salmon: they always come back home eventually.</p>

<p>Last night, I had a nice little chat with Paul Osborne, director of the film
<em>Official Rejection</em>. He told me that deadCENTER really is the fest to be at,
and this would be the guy to ask. He assured me that while this may not be a
farm for “the next big thing” in Hollywood, it is the place to see some really
great filmmakers getting exposure. Since I haven’t seen any films, I can’t
tell you if I agree or not, but the vibe is electric so far. There is a lot of
excitement over the local films that are playing here, which really is the
next big American film movement. Local films are really the “way of the
future”, to quote a DiCaprio’d Howard Hughes.</p>

<p>I’ve got a great deal of work to do. I will probably see 3 films this evening,
and of course let you know all about them. I’m not positive which one’s I’ll
hit, but I will definitely have to miss a few films I really want to see;
there are just so many on the schedule. Keep checking back for more deadCENTER
coverage than you can shake a roll of gaff tape at. Official Rejection trailer
below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow, my day will begin around 5am in Manhattan (NY, not Kansas) but it
will end, most likely, in an Oklahoma City back alley somewhere around 2am.
After landing, I’m going to rush to try to see the third act of this opening
film at the 9th Annual Deadcenter Film Festival, <em>Sweethearts of the Prison
Rodeo</em>. (Don’t worry, I’ll squeeze in a full screening somewhere in there).
This documentary feature by Bradley Beesley tells the story of female inmates
participating in the Oklahoma State Prison Rodeo, which was only first allowed
in 2006. The trailer tells the story better than I do, so just watch. Remember
to check back here early and often as I’ll be constantly updating with
Deadcenter goings on all week.</p>

to the minute coverage from Oklahoma City, I figured I would let you in on a
little known feature of the candler blog. When you are out and about, you may
find yourself in need of a little pop culture deconstruction with nary a
laptop in sight. No fear, just pull out the ol’ cell phone and point to
<a href="http://m.candlerblog.com">http://m.candlerblog.com</a> and our full canon will
come up. There is also a “secret” link at the bottom left hand corner of the
site.</p>

<p>The demo still here is from an iPhone, but this should work on pretty much
anything with a browser. Let us know in the comments if there are any
problems. What’s that? You’d rather just check us in a feed reader? We’ve got
you covered yet again. We’ve got <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/feed/rss2">RSS

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/dsc_3094.jpg" alt="Director Nati Baratz" />On a rainy Friday afternoon, I managed to
spend some time with Israeli filmmaker Nati Baratz. We met at Manhattan’s Film
Forum, where his film, <em>Unmistaken Child</em>, began it’s U.S. theatrical tour
last Wednesday and will be playing there through Tuesday, June 16th. Clutching
an umbrella that flopped in and out which he offered me as a canopy
repeatedly, he and I chatted about his career, his film, and the current state
of documentary cinema.</p>

<p>The film is his first theatrical venture. A graduate of Tel Aviv University’s
film program, Mr. Baratz made two documentaries for television, but as he
tells it, he was a hired gun on those projects, taking them on in an effort to
keep his chops up. <em>Unmistaken Child</em> follows the buddhist monk Tenzin Zopa on
his search for the reincarnation of his late master, Geshe Lama Konchong. For
more specifics, you can read <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/04/review-unmistaken-child/">the candler blog’s
review</a>, but
you would do better to just go see the film.</p>

<p>We began to discuss the positive critical reception of his film, though Mr.
Baratz was quick to point out that not all viewers are pleased with his work.
“ Some people want me to give answers, to give explanations, like more
conventional documetaries. This is fair enough, but it’s not the film I
made.”He’s right. <em>Unmistaken Child</em> features only sparse interviews with the
main subject, Mr. Zopa, and a handful of overlayed text, giving the viewer the
bare minimum of literal context. “People want me to criticize things, to go
deeper. Most don’t even realize how much information there actually is in the
piece, because I made this for Westerners, not Buddhists.”</p>

<p>In 1993, Nati Baratz took his first trip to Tibet and was immediately
enchanted. “I liked the people. Then, after that, I liked the Buddhism. I am
not a Buddhist, but I like their philosophy, their psychology.” He was
initially drawn to Tibet because of the civil rights deadlock that that nation
has been in with China, though this is not evidenced in his film. I asked him
why, if this is so important to him, is there no political edge to his film.
“My way of making activist cinema is something I learned from Buddhism. If you
shout and if you blame, then you only get in return blames and shouting. So I
don’t think this kind of activist movie does good work. My film is activist in
a Buddhist way. I just show the beauty, I show the quality of the Tibetans.
There is a drama. There are also very hard scenes, not everything is nice and
happy, not at all. There are also things that people can criticize the
Tibetans about doing, but overall, when you follow Tenzin Zopa, an
extraordinary human being, then I think the general effect is affection toward
the Tibetan people. This is my way of making activist cinema.”</p>

<p>For five years, <em>Unmistaken Child</em> was the centerpiece of Mr. Baratz’s life.
He moved his family to India halfway through shooting in an effort to save
money on airfare. Due to an agreement he had made early on with Tenzin Zopa,
he was unable to show the footage to anyone for the first two years of
shooting, so the project was completely self-financed. At the beginning,
naturally, he was scared. Mr. Zopa would only allow Nati access if he would
agree to see the process through to completion, no matter how long it would
take to find the reincarnation. However, he found relief once Mr. Zopa
encountered a young boy also named Tenzin, who would become the focal point of
the film’s search for the reincarnated master. “When I returned with these
rushes, I knew that everything would be fine. I knew I had a film that would
be great, that I could only screw it up. From that moment, I invested
everything I had.”</p>

<p>I told Mr. Baratz that his film is the first Israeli film I can think of to
cross the Atlantic that is neither in Hebrew nor Starring Israelis. He
laughed. “I had no idea, I am not an expert on this.” Anytime I would bring up
his nationality, the conversation would quickly veer in another direction. Mr.
Baratz views himself as a citizen of the world. When I drew the parallel
between the situation in the Middle East and the situation in Tibet, he was
taken aback, as though the parallel had never occurred to him. “The endless
cycle of blood in Israel really frustrates you; you feel really hopeless, so
you are looking for a breakthrough. For me, that breakthrough was g0ing to
Tibet. To see the Tibetans’ non-violent struggle for independence, it’s
amazingly inspiring for someone coming from the Middle East.”</p>

<p>As for Mr. Baratz’s influences for making this film, he repeatedly invoked the
names of Robert Flaherty and John Grierson when asked about it. “I like their
documentary tradition, spending a long times in places, getting to know
people. Flaherty and Grierson also dramatized their films without narration.
What I am doing now is going back to the roots of documentary.” In general,
however, he has been influenced more by fiction films than by non-fiction.
“Let me tell you something surprising. One inspiration for this ?lm was Dogme
95, specifically <em>Breaking the Waves</em> by Von Trier. The feeling, the fact that
it doesn?t matter if you use simple camera. The thing that matters is the way
you think of the frames.”</p>

<p>During a question and answer session at one of the recent screenings, Nati
mentioned <em>Star Wars</em> as another influence. He smiles. “ I use a classic
narrative myth. <em>Hero with A Thousand Faces</em> by Joseph Campbell. It?s
classical Joseph Campbell structure. The hero is in his ordinary world. His
master dies. He is called to a mission. He refuses to go to the mission. Then
mentors come and teach him how to go. Then he goes. You can just see the
structure. Of course you play with it because the culture is so different and
I had so many gaps to ?ll.”</p>

<p>We had been chatting in the Film Forum lobby as the crowd lined up to see his
film. An usher came and asked, loudly, for all people in line to see
<em>Unmistaken Child</em> to please squeeze in against the wall to make room for
more. “This is all for <em>Unmistaken Child</em>?” Mr. Baratz asked, wide-eyed and
curious. “Good.” In hoping for a sold out crowd, he is not at all concerned
with his box office appeal. The film is doing fine business and has received
awards and praise the world over. Instead, he scans the crowd as a man on a
mission. “The film has already been picked up by major television stations.
Millions and millions will spend 104 minutes with Tenzin Zopa, so it’s great.
After seeing this film, I believe they will keep a small place in their hearts
for the Tibetan people.”</p>

<p>“I am naive,” he went on to say, “in a way, you have to be to make documentary
films; to make films in general. I want to change the world. I hope, in my
lifetime, Tibet will get independence in a peaceful way. I believe the world
will benefit so much from it, really. I’m not just saying that.” It is not
hard to believe a man that has devoted a great chunk of his life to this
cause. “End the article like this:” he told me, a smile coming across his
face. “Let us hope that Tibet will get independence in our lifetime, in this
reincarnation.” There is an honesty and an irony in his wording. To fully
understand it, you really must see this breathtaking film.</p>

<p>Unmistaken Child <em>is playing through Tuesday, June 16th at Film Forum in New
York. It will open wider in different cities in the cming weeks. <a href="http://www.UnmistakenChild.com/">For more

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The story of boys getting into raunchy trouble at a friend’s Las Vegas
bachelor party is about as old as sin city itself, but never has it been
portrayed so haphazardly as in Todd Phillips’s <em>The Hangover</em>. The film aims
to offend, gross-out, and perpetuate the myth of alcohol-induced male
camaraderie. With strippers, a tiger, Mike Tyson, stereotypical Chinese
gangsters and tons of cash to throw around, it seems the only thing Mr.
Phillips forgot in this movie was a steady stream of laughs.</p>

<p>After a bang up night that no one can remember, Phil, Stu and Alan wake up
sprawled about their Caesar’s suite, a baby in the closet, a tiger in the
bathroom and a chicken wandering aimlessly around the place. Doug, the
milquetoast groom played by Justin Bartha in whose honor the trio got so
royally smashed, has gone missing. The plot of last evening unfurls piecemeal,
with the three friends wandering the strip and the desert back and forth in
search of their lost buddy.</p>

<p>Each of the leads has his own predictable character tweak. Bradley Cooper, as
Phil, is the leader of the pack. Suave and cocksure, he is a grade school
teacher who wouldn’t know actual trouble if it smacked him in the face, but
that doesn’t stop him from looking for certain danger in the name of good
times. Ed Helms fills out Stu, the mild mannered dentist whose girlfriend has
his genitals on a tight leash. Then there is Alan. Zach Galifianakis throws
everything he’s got at this awkward brother-in-law role. He is a man-child, a
sleaze-bag and a damn good reason to plunk down money and see this film. Many
of the film’s best laughs come from his inanity, My favorite was a joke
regarding a certain sensitivity on airplanes in recent years.</p>

<p>In all honesty, this film has a lot of potential to succeed, but it is mostly
held back by it’s cast of sidekicks. Mr. Cooper really needs to step up to the
plate and be the ringleader of this posse, but he is never much afforded the
opportunity. Perhaps he is too compassionate, perhaps he is too mean, but
maybe he is just too, I don’t know, bleh is the best word I can think of. Try
as he might, he cannot fill the shoes of a Vince Vaughn or a Matthew
McConaughey.</p>

<p>Todd Phillips is notable for exploring the dark corners of male adolescent
goofiness. His 2003 <em>Old School</em> is a touchstone film for taking the dumbest
parts of masculinity and soberly deconstructing them with hilarious bits along
the way. <em>The Hangover</em> doesn’t quite reach that level, but it isn’t all bad.
There are a handful of grand laughs along the way, however they are sandwiched
between a whole lot of B-roll and musical interludes. The point? There simply
wasn’t enough meat on this bone for a feature. Maybe some more time in the
oven would have made this steak well done. For now, it’s just half baked.
(Hilarious aren’t I?)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, Google announced an upcoming product called Wave which the tech giant refers to as “what e-mail would look like if it were invented today”. By that they mean a communications system with all of the acquired knowledge of the 21st century without the hangups of the 20th. For detailed info you should really check out the official <a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave site</a>, but I’ll try to keep the pre-required knowledge to a minimum here.</p>

<p>This isn’t a tech site, it’s a film site. So what on earth does this have to do with cinema? Google is inventing this to revolutionize communication and productivity which has essentially been stagnant for decades if not longer. E-mail, as one example, is sent back and forth between one or more people just as the letter or the memorandum was before before it. Wave basically breaks that wide open, offering contextual live editing of a single communiqué. Now, while this can certainly help in producing a film just like it could help any general office task, the overall Wave concepts could be applied on a grander scale for filmmakers.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-things-are">The Way Things Are</h2>

<p>The movie-making process has remained largely unchanged in over a hundred years. Think about it. While technology may have advanced the <em>way</em> we do things, it hasn’t really affected <em>what</em> we are doing. Let’s take a look at the snappy chart below. This is the basic process of filmmaking as it is today the way it has been for decades. Please note that this sample applies to both film and digital workflows. I use the verb “process” below to mean any step that is required to get footage to an editable state. In the tapeless world, this means file copies, transcodes, logging, etc. For now, we’ll work with film for the purposes of discussion, but we’ll get to digital acquisition in a bit.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wave_jobs.png" alt="The Filmmaking Process Today" /></p>

<p>Whether you are making a low-budget documentary or a Hollywood blockbuster, these steps are all required. You go somewhere to shoot your subject. The film is processed at a lab, then color corrected and put onto video tapes, which are then dubbed to any number of formats depending on how many people need to access your footage. This is key, the more people who need to access the footage <em>need</em> a physical copy of it. The tapes are then captured into an editing system and cut together. The final step, listed above as “Finish”, encompasses all of the steps required to get the piece viewable for an audience. Touching up picture, tweaking color, negative cutting, digital intermediate, and film printing are just a few examples of this last leg of filmmaking.</p>

<p>In general, these steps all happen in different places and are performed by different people, which brings us to the fancy chart above. I have trimmed it down to deal with only a few of the behind-the-scenes players. There are so many people involved in making even the shortest of projects, this is barely a cross-section. If you’re shooting a film in Prague, processing footage in England, and cutting in New York while executives in Los Angeles are looking over your shoulder, you will start to see where this process starts to break down. Not only is it a great challenge to keep so many people (often in many languages) on the same page for the duration of a production, but you also introduce a number of points of failure. Any time the project moves from space to space, there are more opportunities for things to go wrong. Film gets lost, damaged, cut incorrectly, etc.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wave_people.png" alt="Filmmaking Jobs" /></p>

<p>So how do we fix this? Well, the same way any other business does, with a whole bunch of paperwork and accountability. E-mails and forms and databases are used to keep track of everything along the way, but these kinds of systems are a safety net. They don’t enhance the process, they simply make it so that when things break down you can find where the weak spot is hidden. How can we change the way we make films in a manner that can boost not only productivity but creativity? I believe we can look to Google Wave for some of the answers.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-things-could-be">The Way Things Could Be</h2>

<p>Google is trying to get users to wrap their heads around this idea of a wave, which is basically the digital equivalent of a white board. In the wave, you can write correspondence, view documents or pictures, incorporate data from other web sources do all kinds of other things that would be available to a group of people sitting around a conference table. Let’s take that idea of a blank space in which a group can do productive work together and focus on it. I think it’s time for another chart.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wave_implementation.png" alt="Wave Filmmaking" /></p>

<p>Holy crap! That chart is brain-frying awesome! So many branches, you probably don’t even know where to start. It’s simple, every job and step passes through the wave. To try and explain this insanity away, I’ll use a more modern tapeless workflow, such as the Red camera. This particular camera shoots 4K raw digital files onto either a hard drive or a flash card. Currently, no system is able to play back the raw media at full resolution, so it must be transcoded to something else. There are many different ways to work with any uncompressed tapeless format, but at least one part of the process is going to be arduous, requiring some heavy lifting on the part of the computer. Let’s not waste time on the specifics of these workflows though, let’s look to the future.</p>

<p>Imagine a wi-fi enabled camera that can shoot the raw media to a local drive and then instantaneously upload a smaller version of the raw file to a server. This will of course require faster networks than we have now, but roll with this idea for a moment. Within moments of being shot, the media is visible and editable in a web browser. An editor can be on set or in an office half way around the world and begin trimming shots down, logging them, and marking them as good or bad. As more media comes in, the editor could begin cutting whole scenes together. At the same time, the cinematographer could have access to the editing server and view some of the cut scenes to ensure his eye-lines are correct. The director could see if any creative changes need to be made. Producers in LA could send notes instantaneously. All of this could happen within the same wave at the same time, theoretically.</p>

<p>Not all of this is possible yet. We simply don’t have fast enough networks or computers to get this all running. Once 64-bit processors and operating systems give way to 64-bit applications, the floodgates will open for some of these heavy lifting processes. Even so, the basic precepts of digital editing could actually be done over a network today. When you make a cut in any digital editing software, you are not actually cutting the high resolution video. Instead, you are actually just telling the application where to make a cut or add an effect. Think of this as a long, lightweight text document that is listing various points where edits need to be made.</p>

<p>Google Wave is currently built to facilitate all kinds of text editing, namely e-mail and chat. If you look at that text document with all of the edits as our core project, you should be able to edit those ins and outs over the internet. But what about the actual footage? In Google’s demo, once one user dragged photos into the wave, a preview of the photos appeared in another user’s wave before the full resolution files were uploaded to the server. This same idea could work for video. A lightweight video could be viewed across a network while the larger files would all be stored on a server somewhere else. Better yet, any and all changes could be saved and stored, listing who made the changes and when.</p>

<p>When it comes to finishing the film, or really doing any kind of heavy lifting that requires the original files, the edits can be taken off the network and re-linked to the master media. This is already a method in use with non-linear editing, but the key is to take the actual editing of the lower resolution media off of a single system and putting it into a wave. Reverting to yesterday’s cut would be a single click away.</p>

<h2 id="why-go-to-all-of-this-trouble">Why go to all of this trouble?</h2>

<p>Cinema is a collaborative art form. A single film requires hundreds of people to work in tandem before it will see the light of day. Why do you think the credits are so long in movies? I like to think that this collaborative nature of filmmaking enhances the final product rather than hindering it. Even when it things really ugly, (a writer butting heads with a director, a producer recutting a film unknowingly) some pretty amazing films can come together because of creative confrontations.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, so many people are working in so many different places with one common goal in mind. Why not move the tools needed to achieve that common goal into the same space? I realize that there is such a thing as too much collaboration. The biggest fear of such a system is that too many people will have access and you’ll cut eighty different version of the same film, all of which are horrible. Well, maybe, but I bet it would be pretty easy to control such a system.</p>

<p>For some productions, the wave will only be accessible to a select few, and maybe some of them don’t have full access privileges. Editorial will be able to edit in one office while a producer is only allowed to leave notes on the file, which can be accessed by everyone. Other productions, maybe a documentary shooting in Africa with an editor in Louisiana, would rely on a deep level of collaboration. Director and editor could be working together over the internet a little bit at a time. Even more to the extreme, director and editor could not even know each other while working together through the web.</p>

<p>There are innumerable ways to make this work for anyone. The technology is not there yet, but we know that it will be. Google is releasing Wave as an open source application that can be installed locally, meaning it’s free and can work on your own hardware. The Big G is specifically asking people to come up with innovative ways to take advantage of the technology they have on offer. In time, I believe that the film community will benefit directly from this concept. In the meantime, keep making beautiful movies the same way you have been for so long.</p>

The Wavy Gravy Movie" />[/caption]</p>

<p>Alright candler readers, get ready to tune in next week for coverage from the
9th Annual deadCENTER Film Festival. I’m pretty excited to head out to
Oklahoma City for the fest. I’ll be doing my darndest to keep the site up to
date daily, so you’d better check back. I’m also working out the kinks in a
liveblogging system so you may even be able to see what I’m thinking
instantaneously. Sound exciting? You bet your ass it is. 6 days and counting.
Here are some highlights from the official press release, but there will be
much much more to come. For more info hit up
<a href="http://www.deadcenterfilm.org">http://www.deadcenterfilm.org</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Notable works juried in this year include <strong>Official Rejection</strong>, a
documentary that walks us through the painful submission - and rejection -
process inherent in independent film. There will be a public panel on this
very topic, led by visiting filmmakers and distinguished film critics. There
will be a free screening of <strong>Saint Misbehavin’: The Wavy Gravy Movie</strong>, shown
for a hippie-infused outdoor audience. Filmmaker-of-note Chopper Burnet brings
<strong>The Twenty</strong> to deadCENTER. Chopper is the voice of NBC – literally. He’s
the voice that you hear on NBC’s national promos. The stars will shine at
<strong>Weather Girl</strong>, which is a hilarious and star-studded feature. And our Okie-
made documentary <strong>Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo</strong> is sure to draw an
enthusiastic hometown crowd.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/unmistakablechild-300x215.jpg" alt="Unmistakeable Child" />With the mountains of Tibet as a setting, a
group as elusive as the Buddhist monks who occupy that land as a subject, and
a conceivably endless search for a reincarnated master as a mission, director
Nati Baratz is given every opportunity to exploit this Eastern culture in his
breakout documentary, <em>Unmistaken Child</em>. Thankfully, his sensibility is much
more refined than that. Instead, Mr. Baratz and his team have crafted a
thought-provoking, emotional journey of the highest regard.</p>

<p>Following the death of Geshe Lama Konchong in 2001, the master’s disciple for
twenty-one years, Tenzin Zopa,  is charged with searching for the Lama’s
reincarnation. Having lived in the service of Lama Konchong for twenty-one
years, he is selected because it is believed that someone so close to the Lama
will be able to recognize him even in the body of a child. This is a story of
emotional redemption and religious discovery, but it is also a detective
story. Tenzin has very few clues to go on, but that does not weaken his
resolve as he heads to the Tsum Valley of Tibet to seek out his master in a
new form.</p>

<p>Forgoing many of the simpler convetions of documentary filmmaking, the story
slowly reveals itself through the eyes of Tenzin. There is no narration, no
staged reveals, very few graphics except when required contextually, and the
only interview is with Tenzin. The audience sees only as much as he does on
his journey. Emotionally, the film also follows the same sine curve as Tenzin.
When he is skeptical, so are we; when he is excited, so are we; when he is
frustrated, overjoyed, nervous, the film always follows suit.</p>

<p>The film is also beautiful. Shot on video, <em>Unmistaken Child</em>, has a certain
washed out feeling to it. This is not a travel film by any means. Even though
the sweeping vistas are enticing, there isn’t a moment in the film when you
feel as though Mr. Baratz and his team are there for the sights. The emotional
progression is of the utmost importance to the filmmakers. The land is a
reflection of the story; the deeper into the mountains Tenzin goes, the more
formidible his search seems to become.</p>

<p>I will not go into the particulars of what happens by the end of the film, but
I promise it is satisfying. We witness the fascinating rituals of a distant
people, but that is far from the point of <em>Unmistaken Child</em>. If nothing else,
it is a case for the inherent innocence of humanity. Tenzin is articulate and
learned, but he is also a big kid. His interaction with all of the children he
seeks out is endearing. He allows himelf to be goofy, playing with the
children, never letting on that this task is the most difficult he has ever
approached.</p>

<p>Viewers of this film will see Buddhism in a new light, perhaps much closer to
their own beliefs than they expect. The universality of human emotion is what
is really on display here. Mr. Baratz put a half decade of his life into
making this film and we are the benefactors. Perhaps it will be a long time
until he makes another, but if he puts only a fraction of the care he put into
<em>Unmistaken Child</em>, you can be certain that it will be another compelling
piece.</p>

<p><em>Unmistaken Child premiered in the U.S. yesterday at Film Forum in New York
City and will slowly make its way to the rest of the country. For more
information <a href="http://www.unmistakenchild.com/">visit the film’s official
site</a>.</em></p>
