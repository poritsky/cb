  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first program of the French selections implied a strong programming
subtext of dark thematic trauma. The initial short <em>Nuisible(s)</em> was light in
tone through its fantastic miniature world, where empty pizza boxes provide
home to a tiny ant-like society and the danger of potential chaos comes when a
giant teenager’s bedroom is on the verge of a cleaning overhaul, pizza and
ants included.</p>

<p>Self taught Sri Lankan filmmaker Pradeepan Raveendran’s <em>Shadows of Silence</em>
initiated the program’s tone with an exploration of the isolation and
depression held within by a suicidal father of three through some great shifts
in time/space. We observe visions of his dead body along the sidewalk of snow
in a manner that electronically calls out like voices from beyond. While
initially very slow in tone and pace, the shock of seeing death soon turns
banal, emphasizing the dread that death is also perhaps a trap of the
quotidian to be escaped.</p>

<p>The initial crowd murmur that occurred upon the possible attendance of New-
Wave-ressurection-associated Louis Garrell was not fulfilled with his presence
as a filmmaker in this screening, but his film <em>Petit Tailluer</em> collapsed the
gap of expectations and excitement. And while the narrative could be clearer
in terms of point of view and setup of protagonist motivation, Garrell’s most
successful contribution is providing Lea Seydoux the opportunity to shine
beyond the roles in which she is normally relegated (ie, love interest to be
conquered in Ridley Scott’s <em>Robin Hood</em>). And while she was not the main
protagonist (although it might have been a stronger choice) her character and
performance choices were an exciting emergence to observe.</p>

<p>The program concluded with three more narrative works that solidified a
growing ascension in tone, including a great juxtaposition of playful
animation and the psychological consequences in an personal docu-animation
about statutory rape in <em>Francoise</em>, and an interesting allegory of the loss
of Muslim conviction in <em>Siggil</em> by Remi Mazet, which was confident in style
and technique but unfortunately lost audiences in terms of depicting taboos
about dogs as bringers of darkness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This week is the <a href="http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?lang=2">Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Fiestival</a> in Clermont-Ferrand, France. Sunrise Tippeconnie is there devoring as many films as he can and sharing them with us here. Check back for more throughout the week.</em><br />
The 23rd Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival opened with some
amazing works that represented various aspects of the programming and
displayed a talent for the eclectic and historically overlooked. The very
first work, <em>This is New Zealand</em> by Hugh MacDonald for the New Zealand
National Film Unit represented a retrospective of New Zealand through
incredible photography that crossed a tri-sected screen reminiscent of and
rivaling Fleisher’s <em>The Boston Strangler</em>. Incredible juxtapositions occurred
as a result of photographic/montage kinetics, but also through amazing
contrasts of truths and stereotypes of the country; particularly strong in the
tongue-in-cheek moments of grazing sheep and the rural farmers. An amazing
find that conveys New Zealand’s strengths in its traditions of documentary,
despite its recent need to depart from it in the strong narrative works of
Taika Waititi and Mark Albiston, who are both represented by other shorts in
this section of the fest.</p>

<p>New Yorker Keith Bearden presented a short from his realm as Lab Competition
selector, <em>Raymond</em> by Bif which combines the mixture of digi-alchemy and
comedy when a test subject is given a test liquid that makes him float, bounce
and contort in various manners, as if a resolve to circumvent any personal
intention of his own. The hilarious nature of the physical comedy should not
diffuse the experimental nature of the film’s plastics that collapse the
bridge between the more antiquated forms of analog and the overly-pixeliated
nature of contemporary formats. Thus, it is an allegory to contemporary
technology and medical research that overlooks the humanity of its subjects.</p>

<p>Also included in the presentation were two retrospective animation works, “Ego
Zhena Kouritsa” from jurist Igor Kovalyov (creator of <em>Rugrats</em> and <em>Duckman</em>)
which displays his more avant-garde approach, and the infamous Tex Avery short
<em>Red Hot Riding Hood</em>. Both instilled a general excitment, not just because of
their rare celluloid presentation, but their intelligent use and approach
towards animation’s malleability as a means to demonstrate the physical
world’s melding with the emotional and emotionally abstract.</p>

<p>Two other shorts that were more playful in their experimental nature were
<em>Comme Un Drapeau Dechu</em>, in which director Samuel Domingo Cervera plays with
hesitant homage to the great Jean-Luc Godard where the landscape of Paris
cannot escape the need for New Wave capture and definitions, so much so that
the filmmaker’s voice over questions the legitimacy of his intentions as well
as the outcome’s similarity to refuse through repetition. Davd Russo, on the
other hand, uplifts this psuedo-doc genre when he depicts his own journey
through depcting his own defense against funders in voice over as we view a
more poetic rendering of investor money spent — the capture of crowds in an
arts festival to convey the collective nature of the medium as time lapse
merges crowds en-masse with hand-drawn animation where they two cannot exist
in this film, nor festival, without each other. The hesitancy of the
investors, in voice over, do not triumph over the filmmaker’s convincing
defense of the collective aesthetics, despite the truth in his title <em>I Am
(Not) Van Gogh</em>.</p>

<p>The evening ended with a film/remix of Disney’s Snow White by DJ/filmmaker
Pogo, which further illustrates the accepting nature of the festival, despite
other world-wide hesitancies toward the digital, the internet and the
continued compression of governmental nuturing of the medium.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don Roos’ <em>The Other Woman</em> opens with the thumping beat of The Flaming Lips’
“Do You Realize?”, a song that serves both as an on the nose explication of
the film to come and a warning to those who watch. “You realize that life goes
fast/It’s hard to make the good things last…” In other words, get out while
you still can.</p>

<p>At its core, <em>The Other Woman</em> is a sappy melodrama, a fact apparently lost on
Mr. Roos. For at least half of the film’s duration, he seems to think he is
making a romantic comedy. The romance is lackluster and the comedy is nigh
non-existent.</p>

<p>The film follows Emilia, played by Natalie Portman, a full grown woman-child
who lands a job as an associate at a non-descript New York lawfirm. After a
chance encounter (thanks to some out-of-place slapstick) with one of the
firm’s brooding partner’s, Jack (Scott Cohen), Emilia falls head over heels in
love and spends a good ten minutes pining for him. Then, he assigns her to
some busy work in another town, they share hotel rooms, and the wheels are in
motion for her to become “the other woman” who breaks up Jack’s marriage. At
the film’s open, they are married and have lost a child not even a week old.</p>

<p>Portman, who also served as executive producer on the project, has trouble
filling out the role of a young Manhattanite who married for money. There is
something awkward about her essence in this film; the way she walks, the way
she peers around the frame. The actress, not the character, feels like a fish
out of water. To be fair, the script is desperately wooden, featuring
expository blurts throughout. Perhaps her source material didn’t offer enough
guidance, but at the very least I presume a movie star could walk around in
high-heel boots without looking like she’ll topple at any moment. Emilia can
not.</p>

<p>I can put all of that aside, however. If <em>The Other Woman</em> is a classical
melodrama, it is a weak one at best. The conflict takes too long to appear,
the main character isn’t sympathetic and the obstacles to happiness are too
easily overcome. Emilia is weak both as a character and as a woman. There are
reveals galore (how, why, when did her baby die?) but no one learns anything.
The hero mustn’t always get her way (in this idyllic case, she does) but she
should have a better understanding of her inner self after the journey of the
film. By the end, Emilia is poised to make all of the same mistakes again.
Here’s to the depressing sequel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since Monday’s announcement that Steve Jobs will be taking an indefinite
medical leave from Apple, it feels like every outlet on the planet has tried
to find a way to spin a story out of the titan’s personal affairs. Speculation
about his prognosis, figuring how this will effect the stock price and, of
course, what this bodes for Apple’s product line.</p>

<p>In a word, it’s all horseshit.</p>

<p>Today, I feel <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118030482">Variety has crossed a
line</a> (or <a href="http:/
/www.instapaper.com/text?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.variety.com%2Farticle%2FVR11180304
82%3Fcategoryid%3D1009%26cs%3D1%26nid%3D2562%26utm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_m
edium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2Bvariety%252Fheadlines%2B%2528Variety
%2B-%2BLatest%2BNews%2529">via Instapaper</a>) into territory I feel like I can address, so I’d
like to call them on the carpet. In a throwaway piece which appears online
this morning, no doubt in a sidebar in print, they haphazardly speculate that
Jobs’ condition could have implications for Final Cut Pro. Here’s the opening
sentence of the piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monday’s news that Apple topper Steve Jobs is taking medical leave is sure
to prompt speculation about Apple’s commitment to Final Cut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole thing tops out at 97 words. It’s not a scoop; it’s stirring the pot
and filling up the page. Moreover, the whole idea seems to be the brainchild
of someone who doesn’t know anything about Apple, post production or the movie
industry. That’s three pretty big fails for Variety. Here are some clues as to
why this is a load:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Final Cut is pervasive, but it’s far from the only game in town. A trade
paper like Variety doesn’t seem to have any business worrying about this. 2.
Jobs has never been seen, at least not since Apple’s acquisition of Final Cut
in 1998, as a guru of all things FCP. In fact, the application runs counter to
almost all of the software advances Apple has made over the last decade,
retaining roughly the same design since 1999. 3. If there is to be a new Final
Cut coming out this year (and I do believe there is) then the major changes
are already complete. It’s doubtful that Jobs was fine-tuning the program with
the development team this late in the game. If there is hay to make from Jobs’
departure, it’s that the 2013 release of FCP could be called into question,
but certainly not anything coming out this year. I feel very strongly that
Final Cut Pro is the best editing application for me, and I hope that in its
future Apple will bring us into a new age of streamlined editing. In his
tenure as CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs has changed the way the world looks at
technology. From the Mac to the iPod to the iPad to the iPhone, he has helped
invent more products that affect the lives of millions than most can ever
hope. Nonetheless, Final Cut is safe without him, and it’s downright
inappropriate to suggest otherwise. Shame on you, Variety.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, I attended a screening of Tom Hooper’s <em>The King’s Speech</em> at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York. After the film, Mr. Hooper, Claire Bloom, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth were all on hand for a Q&amp;A session moderated by Elvis Mitchell. I was able to go because, besides being a film journo of sorts, I am also on the mailing list of an organization called <a href="http://www.btlnews.com">Below the Line</a>, which offers cinema perks to lower-rung film industry workers. (I work in post production when I’m not writing about films.)</p>

<p>The BTL screenings I’ve been to before have been pretty small and generally cozy. I was curious how this little known group could fill up the palatial Ziegfeld. Apparently, this screening was mostly for card carrying members of the Screen Actors Guild. SAG filled up the bulk of the seats, while the BTL gang filled in the gaps.</p>

<p>I work in the film industry and I see it from many different angles. Anyone who has the mettle to eek out a living in this business is okay by me. There is very little glamour going around; we all have to eat. But there is something about a room full of actors that amplifies a number of stereotypes about them. A silliness, a vacuousness. When the lights went down and the film came up, I found almost immediately that I chose the worst possible film to see surrounded with this lot.</p>

<p><em>The King’s Speech</em> not only features a handful of great performances, but it is about performance itself. This is emphasized immediately; the film opens with a broadcaster readying his vocal chords by gargling and mumbling tongue twisters in front of a massive microphone. The process, it seems, is the thing. Very quickly, scarlet walled theater felt like a corporate event, say, a lawyer convention with a comic announcing “a good start!” up on stage.</p>

<p>It felt like when, in <em>Funny People</em>, James Taylor calls out to a crowd of Myspace employees “Fuck Facebook!” There is a moment in <em>The King’s Speech</em> when Michael Gambon, as King George V, sets up a joke that with the advent of radio the King is becoming something far worse than a mere figurehead, he was becoming an actor. The crowd ate this up, laughing long enough to stomp on a few lines. Some, it seemed, tried to outdo one another with louder laughter, some hand claps, going big with the reaction. The joke, it seems, was on them.</p>

<p>The worst, and I have been kind up until now, came when Elvis Mitchell opened up to the audience for questions after warming up the talent on stage. Public Q &amp; A sessions are an audience draw, but handing the mic out at random can be a dreadful experience, you never know who you’re going to get. The person who shot his hand up first was sitting in the front row, so Elvis trotted the mic over to him. As is often the case, the man opened not with a question, but with a lengthy pronouncement. This, unquestionably, was the worst one I’ve heard yet, and the speaker should be embarrassed and ashamed of himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“First of all, to Colin Firth, great great work. That was such an amazing performance. you’ve made my decision very easy when it comes time to vote for the SAG best male performance. Also, I’ve worked with you before and I noticed how nice to me you were and I thought ‘Why is he being so nice to me? I’m just a nobody.’ but you really were. Just great. But my question…Oh! And Tom Hooper, great direction, really really wonderful. I hope we get to work together someday soon.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To his credit, at that moment, with the crowd releasing an agonizing grown, Elvis Mitchell made a motion to grab for the microphone. He almost took it back and made it clear to this character that he’d better stop grovelling for work and ask a question. And so he asked about how Colin Firth prepared for the role. And so did the next person. And so did the person after that.</p>

<p>What’s annoying is that on the first go, Colin roundly answered the question of how he played a stammering king. he explained how he was interested in Prince Albert’s life as a conflicted man, and noted that the internal struggle of any man is no different no matter the time period. (He also caddishly mentioned that he has some experience playing British gentry.) If you ask me, this is golden advice to budding actors, but they all seemed so obsessed with the plasticity of his performance. “How did you learn to stammer?” The brilliance of Firth’s performance is not that he figured out how to stammer, but that he gave voice to a man through the stammer. There is no question of Bertie’s (as he goes by in the film) strength as a leader, and yet his most important duty, to speak to his people at a time of war, is nigh impossible given his vocal flaw. To balance such raw power with open vulnerability is extremely difficult. To stammer, not so much.</p>

<p>All told, I enjoyed the film even if the crowd was a bit goofy. Not all actors make for a bad audience. The ones on stage, for example, seemed to be fine company indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It should be noted that this list was meant to be called “Sunrise’s Most Inspiring Films of 2010”, but if you would like to look at this as a “best of” list, then that’s okay too. On with the films.</p>

<p><em>Altamont Now</em> (Joshua von Brown)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ftf008cover_small.jpg" title="Altamont Now" /></p>

<p>While on an initial viewing the limits of the dialog and performance dominate, the feel of immediate deconstruction and analysis inherent in contemporary punk aesthetic comes to the forefront as the work’s strength. Screaming with energy and an intelligent sorting through the problems of action in contemporary counter-culture <em>Altamont Now</em>’s smartly delineates a movement’s disintegration through a mocking use of the medium itself to pose the question of any mediation as a legitimate for of contemporary “culture.”</p>

<p><em>The Anchorage</em> (C.W. Winter &amp; Anders Edstrom)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TheAnchorage_still1.jpg" title="The Anchorage Film Still" /></p>

<p>It is precisely the quiet and perhaps “bare” nature of this fiction/non- fictive hybrid that allows for a simple return to cinema basics. Without the hindrance of narrative’s contrived relationship with cinema, Winter and Anders have found a contemplative observation of the quotidian rituals of Edstrom’s mother that hint at the normalcy and perhaps banality of the spiritual. While the 16mm cinematography feels cleansing in it’s earthy tactility, it becomes fascinatingly apparent were are also observing Cinema think through the necessity and purpose of Story; quite an undertaking for a first feature.</p>

<p><em>The Eclipse</em> (Conor McPherson)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/theeclipse.jpg" title="The Eclipse Still" /></p>

<p>McPherson’s dramatic rendering of a writer haunted by the memory and emotions of his deceased wife pushes through the conventions of a ghost story to focus on the fragility of human emotions during such nebulous mental states. Overcoming the fear of unknowns, that are primarily psychological and emotional, further grounds the genre into horror-realism in a manner similar to Hans-Christian Schmid’s story of demonic possession in <em>Requiem</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Girl on the Train</em> (Andre Techine)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Girl-on-the-Train.jpg" title="The Girl on the Train" /></p>

<p>Techine’s narrative mastery evokes intelligent questions about the self- ascribed identity and relationships of a young digital native who’s contemporary thought processes dismisses consequences. As a brief lie comes to a dramatic head, her actions reveal complicated ambiguities that her digital- immediacy cannot escape as she recognizes the endangered concept of responsibility.</p>

<p><em>I Am Love</em> (Luca Guadagnino)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/I-Am-Love.jpg" title="I Am Love" /></p>

<p>Elusive in its structure due to the passion that excites the use of every frame, Giadagnino vigorously captures the electricity about life (as well as the fragility of such emotionally charged energy) in a manner seamlessly in- tune with its subject matter that it seems Giadagnino’s naturally composed of cinema himself. It will be quite exciting to see how he grows into further fictional work.</p>

<p><em>Kisses</em> (Lance Daly)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Kisses.jpg" title="Kisses" /></p>

<p>Daly’s reliance upon an impressionism over narrative appropriately captures the threats that adult logic and thinking imposes upon a child’s emotionally rejuvenating imaginings and observations. While two young kids run away from home, their ability to out dodge adults becomes a metaphor of escapism from the oppressive customs of global-market capitalism. Daly’s allowance of a meandering camera captures this fleeting essence inherent in the young that embrace an innocent excitement about the world that has not been so gracefully depicted since the likes of Lynn Ramsay. Daly lingers on what we dare to cinematically link to nostalgia before it really becomes underwhelmed in comparison with the contemporary delights of the digital.</p>

<p><em>No Easy Decision</em> (Morgan J. Freeman) <a href="http://www.mtv.com/videos/no-easy-decision- special/1654990/playlist.jhtml">[Watch the Film]</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/No-Easy-Decision.jpg" title="No Easy Decision" /></p>

<p>While footage remains tame, MTV’s one-time airing of the thought and emotive processes (rather than practical and physical documentations) of Markai Durham’s underage abortion choice has brought forth a dominant discussion in a manner that seems timely by mediated standards, yet late in terms of home- politics discussion. Drew Pinski leads discussion that is reminding of a time when AIDS was an under-discussed because of fear and limited knowledge. Not “vivid” enough for some and blasphemy for others, the controversial episode’s intelligent purpose of discussion is clearly visible upon the MTV website, where young audience members are discussing and messaging over this issue that will come to dominate their future elections.</p>

<p><em>Paper Covers Rock</em> (Joe Maggio)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Paper-Covers-Rock.jpg" title="Paper Covers Rock" /></p>

<p>What at first feels like a trite DIY-verite becomes quite intriguing through it’s sensitive character analysis and possibly unintentional Mumble-genre self-analysis. Jeannine Kaspar’s incredible performance depicts the achievement of a depression-ridden Sam to find a means to recognize one’s responsibility to those outside of one’s own body/mind that also metaphorically transcends the critical resistance against “mumble” works to find a movement towards a more matured DIY POV.</p>

<p><em>Please Give</em> (Nicole Holofcener)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Please-Give.jpg" title="Please Give" /></p>

<p>Holofcener once again astonishes in her abilities to connect the dots about the contemporary world, in which we associated non-relevance with death and the bravery that must be evoked to over hurdle through emotional non-relevance to find mature relationships. Holofcener’s witty dialog compliment a poetic, yet piercingly real depictions of the contemporary American neurosis that is neatly holding her place as a possible Woody Allen successor.</p>

<p><em>Princess of Mars</em> (Mark Atkins)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Princess-of-Mars.jpg" title="Princess of Mars" /></p>

<p>Direct-to-DVD sci-fi cult distributor <em>The Asylum</em>’s prolific director of photography / director Mark Atkins has finally found a work that caters to his bizarrely illogical narrative jumps and campy performance styles in a recent drafting of E.R. Burroughs. I can only marvel and admire Atkin’s abilities to create a coherent work that works on the level of 60s sci-fi cultish fun and contemporary war-subtext (although quite conservative in tone) in under twelve days of shooting. Arkin’s auteur-istic tendencies (in the comparison with someone like Lucio Fulci or William Castle) should not be over looked despite it’s quality, especially in today’s cinematic landscape overtaken by ‘Fincher’s and ‘Anderson’s.</p>

<p><em>The Social Network</em> (David Fincher)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/The-Social-Network.jpg" title="The Social Network" /></p>

<p>Still amazingly brilliant in statement, just as much as in his deceptively subtle execution, Fincher continues to push his cinematic mastery into realms that rival those he’s studied and admires sooner than most expected.

<p><em>Tik Tok – Ke$ha Parody</em> (thecomputernerd01) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47wUQZs1_NQ">[Watch the Film]</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Tik-Tok-Kesha-Parody.jpg" title="Tik Tok Ke$ha Parody" /></p>

<p>While computernerd01’s intention seems to be a simple parody of pop-star Ke$ha’s <em>Tik Tok</em>,, the manner of execution amazingly works on multiple levels of abstraction and analysis of pop culture vacancy. Similar in ambition and energy as XsamiSDx’s video , which glamourizes and epitomizes the empty limits of the “pop” codified, what thecomputernerd01 has been able to identify is how the ease of commercial concepts of product are easily interchangeable between different companies, since their value is the same regardless of product. There is as much meaning behind Peter Griffin as there is behind Ke$sha’s lyrics. The logic of computernerd01’s lyrics convey this dis-associative reality behind the absurdist tendencies of consumer internet-linkage as contemporary rational logic or works cited, where drinking <em>Sprite</em> is the same as <em>Coca Cola</em> and the logic of punching <em>Captain Crunch</em> is perfectly possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It takes almost no time to demystify Darren Aronofsky’s <em>Black Swan</em>, which is
a real shame because its slight of hand is most of what it has going for it. I
spent most of its duration guessing where it could be headed besides the
obvious, but I was left sorely disappointed by the end. Aronofsky has made a
striking film that will certainly incite discussion if only for his
referential technique (Deren’s <em>Meshes of the Afternoon</em>, Polanski’s
<em>Repulsion</em>, Argento’s <em>Suspiria</em>, and there’s probably more), but ultimately
it is empty, lacking the elements it so desperately tries to evoke, namely
sexuality, musicality and brutality.</p>

<p><em>Black Swan</em> is the story of Nina Sayers, a virginic dancer with a New York ballet company played by Natalie Portman. When she gets the lead spot in a new production of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake, she must grapple with her rigidity in order to fulfill darker side of her character’s dance. As the white swan, she is a perfect fit given her tightly wound prissiness; it is the black swan transformation that she has trouble with. Nina must access her dark side, her pent up sexuality,  in order to succeed.<br />
Swan Lake’s narrative, it is made clear, parallels Nina’s, a conceit that
becomes annoyingly obvious once Mila Kunis shows up as Lily, a wild,
disorganized and passionate dancer who wears exclusively black apparel
(shocker). The effect plays about well as in <em>Twister</em> where the baddies drove
black SUVs while the good guys towed around in white, which is to say it plays
predictably.</p>

<p>Aronofsky’s lack of a funny bone severely brings this film down. There are
laughs, but they appear by mistake. Two big ones break up masturbation
sequences (yep, plural). It’s not as much that the director should be bringing
proper laughs to this sort of a film, but if he had a clue about comedy he
could have avoided these awkward truncations. Moreover, if this film is
missing anything it’s a comedic self-awareness. So much energy is spent hiding
the mysterious, the phantasmagoric elements of the film that the human element
is never allowed to shine through.</p>

<p>When it comes to sex, Aronofsky seems to approach the topic too literally.
Just having two hot young actresses go at it does not make the film sexy. The
much ballyhooed lesbian scene plays mechanically, straightforward; not erotic.
There is a romance to the camera, to the editing that Aronofsky is missing.
The filmmaker is not making love with the tools he has at hand so the passion
falls flat. This doesn’t just go for the sex, either.</p>

<p>As a dance film, <em>Black Swan</em> is second rate. There is some inspired closeup
photography of Portman’s feet, plié-ing and pas de deux-ing all over the
place, and there are definitely a few wonderful sequences including Nina’s
final attempt at becoming the black swan. However, overall, Aronofsky treats
dance less as art and more as sport. Focusing on the feet of a ballet dancer
basically misses the forrest for the trees. <em>Mao’s Last Dancer</em> from earlier
this year had an atrocious narrative but at least its dance numbers were
impeccably executed. Aronofsky focuses on his gritty flourishes so much so
that we miss the point of the dance, which ultimately brings the story down.
If we never see why Nina loves to dance (but we do hear her say it) then why
should we follow the plot at all?</p>

<p>I’ll admit, I’m being a bit hard on this film, but I feel very strongly that
its shortcomings outweigh its successes. What it gets right are the cinematic
equivalent of parlor tricks, which is a grave frustration given how good this
film wants to be. When you remove the film’s plasticity, you are left with
nothing much at all but a 135 year old Russian ballet. I’d rather go see it at
Lincoln Center myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why write about <em>The Social Network</em> now? When advances occur it usually takes
time to appropriately access the real nature of any advancement, so of course
it should take the appropriate amount of time necessary before this analysis
and comprehension. After giving Fincher’s latest masterwork the amount of time
given internet-advancement, that with which I conclude is an unexpected
sympathy for Fincher’s sculpting of Zuckerberg, or I should say Fincher’s
sculpting of Marylin Delpy’s sympathy of Zuckerberg. Wait, who is Marylin?
This question is part of the point, in time…</p>

<p>?While most have focused on the Citizen Kane aspect of the pseudo-biographic
nature of the narrative (and appropriately so, despite Fincher’s denial of
such) and have often overlooked the title’s allusion and thematic extensions
of opportunism and the communication-industry’s pessimism in Lumet’s
<em>Network</em>, Fincher’s work has decisively specific additions that go beyond a
contemporary portrait of the “time” and provide a caveat of the “time’s”
problematic future.</p>

<p>?While Zuckerberg is viewed through the eyes of an accessor, that of his
attorney associate Marylin Delpy, she immediately links together the
historical and factual elements that support a simplistic biographic
rendering. What is unique about Marylin’s conveyance of Zuckerberg is her
specific goal: to conclude the manners in which Zuckerberg may be viewed as
slightly autistic, an opportunistic asshole, or simply obsessively reaching
towards vengeance. Marylin’s drive to match historical moments with these
tendencies are what structure the scenes of the narrative’s past: Zuckerberg
being impersonal when relating to dorm mates about girls, his dismissive
attitude towards Eduardo almost every other scene, his condescending demeanor
in the company of businessmen or authority figures. If each one of these
scenes were to be entered into evidence, they would imply and support any of
the previous personality traits theories. This uniquely places Marylin in the
position of editor/director, in which she guides the audience through
time/space, allowing us to view through her evidence-glasses to convey the
worst-case depiction of character.</p>

<p>What this structuring implies is a need to define and explain situations/facts
to complete Marylin’s argument that “Zuckerberg is a terrible person, and
here’s why.” What this simplistic rendering does not allow is identification
with Zuckerberg, since Marylin’s approach is driven to combat the opposing
attorney’s case and a sympathetic drafting would not win the lawsuit. Without
the recognition of Marylin’s point of view the audience is left with a
despicable character study that would alone imply a wrong and limited
depiction of a real person; Zuckerberg becomes just an unsympathetic
protagonist, or as “symbolic” for the limits of the contemporary male.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Fincher does not broach the subject of the
contemporary male, but his representation comes as caveat. The modern young
male is riddled with problematic condescension towards the opposite sex. While
Eduardo Saverin is played off as a nice guy, his interactions with women are
perhaps overly concerned with exclusivity as a means to get laid (just like
the Winklevoss’ Harvard dating website). The moment we find Eduardo at the
frat party, standing next to a Dustin Moskovitz whom mentions that he’s
finding an algorithm to describe the reason behind Asian girl attraction to
Jewish boys, Fincher places these “boys” within a visual reference to John
Hughes’ Sixteen Candles.</p>

<p>While this reference allows a context for the film to be read as a coming-of-
age picture, the reference then by extension also implies the resolute ending
of responsibility acceptance and the eventual maturing of a heterosexual
relationship. Instead, what results for these characters is anything but
maturity or acceptance of responsibility.</p>

<p>Instead of mature heterosexual relationships, we find women are relegated to
game-media in the same way they were once relegated within the kitchen. Within
game play there is no responsibility for the decisions that are made via
computer programming, coding, or marketing. The young women whom play the
games within the film, are then placed into a context of non-integration into
this male-dominated industry. Exclusivity returns as a theme that divides the
sexes, as all those involved in the Zuckerberg business are male: male coders,
male businessmen, and male representatives. Women, are instead allowed to
drink a Sex-In-the-City appletini instead of adding to the discussion of
business as a partner.</p>

<p>What Eduardo, Dustin, or even Sean Parker do not realize is their light-speed
business development has allowed no progress in human relationships, much less
any development on the heterosexual home-front that allows women a place like
older and more traditional business modes: Gretchen, the older attorney that
runs Eduardo’s case, or Marylin Delpy. While Zuckerberg bickers through his
intellectual pissing match, revolutionary as it is, Erica Albright is
developing into maturity without him. This realization does not occur for
Zuckerberg until the moment he asks Marylin to dinner. Marylin’s refusal
confirms a divide between two generations. Yet, what separates Marylin and
Zuckerberg is not age, nor even success, but maturity. While Zuckerberg may be
financially successful, he is reactionary and emotionally unstable to make
important life decisions (also a problem for his placement as a CEO), or when
confronted with the opposite sex. Marylin, despite being impressed by
Zuckerberg, is established and on the verge of becoming a partner in her line
of work, but not able to overlook his place as young. It’s no coincidence that
Marylin shares a visual similarity to Erin, since it is this clue that
provides for an audience mental recall, and perhaps initiates Zuckerberg’s
moment of development and maturity at the end of the picture, which we’ll
discuss in a moment. First, we must understand that what blocks Zuckerberg’s
development is his unquestioned belief in the structure of the society he’s
been led to believe is influential and important.</p>

<p>Marylin states that she can make us believe anything if she’s just given the
power to suggest, and as mentioned earlier Fincher allows her this privilege,
but so to does he convey those of an upper class (those “of means”) also
maintain a stance of power merely through suggestion without any fear of
confrontation nor refute.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that,”  Mr.
Winklevoss states to his second-placed twin sons, which at first sounds as a
means to comfort for having to not apologize. Yet the father’s decoded message
reveals a context of status and class, implying that he is embarrassed and
these young men can do their duty to not apologize (and further, not embarrass
their family name) again when they no longer lose a race and they work hard
enough to remain on top. The Winklevoss twins find themselves constantly
reminded of their place in society, their statements and pleas are re-
questioned or rephrased by those older, or of a higher class, not in an
attempts for resolution, but instead as a means to reprimand. These arrogant
rephrasings not only inherently dismiss any oppositional assertions that also
remind the other one’s place, but they are continually coded within manners.
Every phrase and action of courtesy becomes a potential home for social-threat
and insult.</p>

<p>The film’s immediate references towards this arrogance is conveyed within a
bar,  an environment in which there should be no such class-status, yet
Zuckerberg’s initial conversation with Erica Albright approaches this coded
condescension accidentally.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg states that he will introduce her to people she’d “be meeting
people you wouldn’t normally get to meet,” once he’s admitted into an
exclusive fraternity. With the reaction of her offense, the audience takes
note about the manner in which every male places themselves in a position of
rank or power, be it consciously reinforced through the coded messages of
Winklevoss society, or subconsciously as in this pre-break-up moment between
Zuckerberg and Erica.</p>

<p>While this coded reinforcement of status is a clear theme throughout the film,
the narrative thus utilizes this breakup as an emotionally insightful
incident. What takes Zuckerberg the rest of the film to comprehend, Erica
states quite flatly when she’s accused of duplicitous statements: I didn’t
mean to be cryptic. What is important here is that Erica consciously
recognizes that she has hidden pain and offense within sarcasm to briefly hurt
and offend Zuckerberg. Erica momentarily plays the game of codes through
sarcasm, placing herself above Zuckerberg before she realizes that she’s hurt
his feelings and apologizes. Her apology is what allows this moment to hold no
further weight upon her shoulders, and allows her the ability to transcend all
other characters. No other characters, with the exception of Zuckerberg, come
to the conclusion of apology.</p>

<p>So where is the concept that Zuckerberg transcends this moment as immature
asshole to convey the recognition of his mistakes? To understand this, we must
realize the Zuckerberg communicates most effectively through codes, himself.
While this is brilliantly conveyed through the symbolic nature of Zuckerberg’s
technical mastery at computer coding, the film also reveals characters
comprehending a message from Zuckerberg sent to them via forms of
communication other than traditional modes of conversation. Through the coded
messages of internet hacking, newspaper coverage, or website creation, the
Winklevoss’s comprehend Zuckerberg is giving them the proverbial/virtual
finger, so what better mode to apologize for his subconsciously coded
arrogance than through the mode that best expresses his attempts to prove he’s
sorry and create a website that revolutionarily overthrows class assertions of
power and status. His attempts to rectify are thus rendered in an internet
power-play. The intention of this plan can be read as assertion to those “of
means” that they don’t have the hold upon society in the manner in which they
believe to be most true, and the ability to overthrow their influence through
the gift of exclusivity to all via a webpage eventually open to everyone.
Exclusivity becomes antiquated. This coded message also calls out as
apologetic recognition of Zuckerberg for allowing this society’s subconscious
influence to over take him momentarily in the bar, and the actions to
overthrow this exclusive mentality then becomes his mode of apology to Erica.</p>

<p>This character intention holds the key to understanding Zuckerberg in a way
that Marylin’s observations do not. It is critical to understand the human
element here, despite the strongly fictionalized addition of Erica or Marylin
by Sorkin, since Erica’s response to this statement is offense and breakup
results in emotion: panic and sorrow on the part of Zuckerberg. “You would do
that for me?” Erica states before she declares he is an asshole, and leaves.
Zuckerberg, left to say he’s sorry in monotone that audibly sounds deceptive.
Later paralleled with Erica, when Zuckerberg is offered possibilities of
inclusion by the elite Winklevoss twins in their plans for their Harvard
dating website, Zuckerberg repeats Erica’s words “You would do that for me?”
While this moment is most likely the hatching of this previously mentioned
revolutionary plan, it also suggests that Zuckerberg is not completely
ignorant of Erica’s offended reaction, and he further becomes humanistic
through his empathy.</p>

<p>The moments that lie outside Marylin’s evidence-seeking structuring are the
attorney negotiations, the few moments in which this real multi-dimensional,
emotional, and perhaps more sympathetic Zuckerberg resides. In fact the real
motivated emotional outbursts of Zuckerberg come at these moments, such as his
threatened and reactionary monologue toward the Winklevoss’ attorney about
their taking his “the minimum amount” of attention. While this moment is the
heart an aggressive attitude that Marylin’s narrative fully supports, what she
doesn’t really convey are the possible emotional ranges Zuckerberg feels that
are more in common with those not managing a multi-billion dollar company:
human feelings of love, connection, companionship.</p>

<p>Thus we return to the end of the narrative, at a moment in which Marylin no
longer has control over the structuring of information, a moment that is
amazingly and poignantly captured when Zuckerberg interacts with Facebook in a
manner that we’re all familiar: the profile page, rather than any series of
Zuckerberg’s pages of coding. This moment is crucial to both a humanist
drafting of Zuckerberg’s identity as well as solidifying the unrequited
potential for his unrecognized apology.</p>

<p>The sadness of this final closing moment is not that Zuckerberg is autistic,
nor an asshole, nor obsessive, but that he has allowed the success of business
to fade this retaliation against elitism into the background, and with it the
initial impulse for apology. And thus with every click, we await the
confirmation of Zuckerberg’s atonement by the  fictional Erin, in hopes of the
confirming that Marylin’s fractured Zuckerberg portrait is nothing but
fiction. Not the negative portrait of a “Kane”-like figure as we initially
thought two months ago (years in internet time, I’m sure).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/11/apreture3promo.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/11/apreture3promo.jpg" alt="Aperture 3 Promotional Still from Apple's
Website" /></a>Last week I listed my hopes for
early 2011’s iteration of Final Cut Studio. I’ve gotten some great feedback
for more additions folks would like, especially on <a href="http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/area-51/487396-wish-list-2011-final-cut-
studio.html">this
thread</a> over at DVInfo.net. The two biggest cries seemed to be for 64-bit
applications across the board and GPU acceleration, which are both long
overdue at this point. However, I’d like to focus just on the unchanged
interface of Final Cut Pro for now by looking at Apple’s other major creative
app, Aperture.</p>

<h2 id="when-stills-arent-still-anymore">When Stills Aren’t Still Anymore</h2>

<p>Back in 2008, the photography gurus over at The Luminous Landscape posted an
article called <a href="http://www.luminous-
landscape.com/essays/red-raw.shtml">Raw Goes to the Movies</a>. In it, they lay out the similarities
between the Red One camera and digital SLR technology. The key quote comes
from a disclaimer at the head of the piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are significant implications for the still photography industry in the
RED One and its kin, so if some insights into the future of our industry is of
interest, read on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the RED One came the Nikon D90, followed by the much-lauded Canon 5D
Mark II. Now, you can’t make a DSLR without adding HD video. And so we have
two kinds of artists, photographers and filmmakers, converging on the same
products. I know folks who rarely shoot video with their SLRs and some who
rarely shoot stills. It’s a completely different landscape than it was just a
few years ago. Production gear may be moving to meet the needs of filmmakers,
but post-production solutions have been slow to follow.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the transition from tape to tapeless has been building
post-production software that can keep up with the advances in cameras. When
Panasonic introduced their P2 format, most were excited that the hassles of
tape would go away. Instead, what we found was that, at least in Final Cut,
the digital files still had to be transcoded, a process that took only a bit
less time than capturing tapes. Things have only gotten worse as digital
formats have proliferated. The files out of Canon’s HDSLRs are compressed
H.264s. While they look absolutely stunning, they don’t take as well to color
correction as tape formats, they still require transcoding in order to be
smoothly edited, and their lack of timecode makes it impossible to match back
to your camera “raw” files. At least, that’s the way things are today.</p>

<h2 id="photo-editing-for-film-editors">Photo Editing for Film Editors</h2>

<p>In Aperture’s parlance, “photo editing” is the process of selecting which
photos stay and which will go. “Image editing” is when you get in there and
start adjusting colors, curves and anything else you like. I’ll leave it to
armchair lexicographers to argue the nominal differences between the terms.</p>

<p>Filmmaking is an extremely old school game, mired in a century of tradition.
Our digital editing platforms are all based around language that comes from
cutting film my hand. Clip, Bin, and even Viewer are all terms that relate to
physical pieces found in an old editing suite. When we went to cutting tape
instead of film, the format may have changed but the process barely did.
Tapeless workflows, especially for files coming out of HDSLRs, are radically
different.</p>

<p>With Aperture 3, Apple introduced the ability for photographers to ingest all
of their video files alongside their photos. Once inside of Aperture, videos
can be trimmed, tagged, rated, and placed into HD slideshows. They can also be
exported for editing in Final Cut Pro, but this process is a bit more
laborious than Apple lets on. Aperture 2 only offered to place any non-photo
files into a specified directory outside of the photo library. Now, it treats
video as if it were a photo that moves.</p>

<p>Imagine a video library for each Final Cut project that is self-contained,
much like the Aperture Library. In it you could tag media, hide clips you
don’t like, and update metadata quickly in an interface that mimics Aperture.
While you can certainly edit metadata in Final Cut today, the Browser window
is cramped. Even when you have a monitor big enough to stretch it out, it’s
tough to get anywhere without a right click. The simplicity of photo editing
in Aperture, Adobe’s Lightroom and similar applications is something that
could make media organization for video editors a breeze.</p>

<h2 id="final-aperture-pro-the-perfect-final-cut-8">Final Aperture Pro, The Perfect Final Cut 8?</h2>

<p>Aperture 3 is 64-bit, exists within one unified window and sports a slick
full-screen interface, three features that make it the perfect pro app for Mac
OS X 10.7 Lion. As I pointed out in <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/11/12/a-wish-list-for-the-2011-final-
cut-studio/">my Final Cut Studio wish
list</a>, Final Cut’s interface is still based around a Mac OS 9 design.
Whether we like it or not, the overall interface is do for an overhaul and I
have a feeling it’s going to, eventually, start looking a lot like Aperture 3.</p>

<p>When I bring this up to other working editors, the biggest fear is that they
would have to re-learn how to use Final Cut Pro. Most admit that the interface
has its drawbacks, but has ultimately won them over. Changing things
drastically would, unquestionably, alienate a lot of users. A few
counterpoints to that though:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You don’t have to upgrade. 2. You should never upgrade in the middle of a
project, ever, on any platform. 3. Change for the sake of change is bad, but
iterative interface upgrades aren’t inherently bad. 4. You <em>can</em> learn new
software; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Panic_(The_Hitchh
iker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)#Don.27t_Panic">don’t panic</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple, I hope, learned their lesson about drastically changing their
interfaces after they introduced iMovie ’08. They are not a company that makes
the same mistake twice, so don’t expect Final Cut 8 to be identical to
Aperture 3. I’m betting it will still look very similar to the same ol’ Final
Cut interface, but hopefully in one unified window that can make use of full
screen real-estate. The biggest update I’d like to see is a browser that looks
a lot more like Aperture, while keeping the actual tools of cutting the same
(or similar).</p>

<p>What Aperture does well is keep projects organized under one roof. Final Cut
is still based around a folder/bin structure that is up to the editor to
maintain. There are times when “Smart Folers”, organized on the fly by
metadata, would come in extremely handy in Final Cut. Photographers have the
luxury of software that is built to bring in all of their creative output,
whether it ends up being worth keeping around or not. Video editors, on the
other hand, can lose control very quickly when piles of media get sucked into
a bloated Final Cut project.</p>

<p>Documentaries for example have far more unused footage than fiction films
simply by the nature of how shooting one works. In an Aperture-like version of
Final Cut Pro, the documentarian can throw all of the footage he or she has
into a Final Cut project and begin tagging and/or rating the various takes.
Some films take years to shoot. With Final Cut as it stands now, it can be an
insurmountable task to organize all of that footage. In fact, it may be easier
to keep it organized outside of Final Cut. With a more robust organization
system, this process could become much simpler to handle.</p>

<p>A system like this could also, theoretically, cut out the lengthy transcoding
process filmmakers go through that leaves them with (at least) two sets of
media. I’d love to see a version of Final Cut that treats camera originals of
HDSLR video the same way it now treats RAW stills, in which the original files
are always accessible beneath whatever “version” is currently in use. This
could, potentially, subvert the need for real timecode on DSLRs, because your
camera originals would be linked by file name. It’s not a perfect solution,
but one that could work better that we have right now.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that when Apple introduced iMovie ’08’s much-maligned interface,
their intention was to judge how users took to it in hopes of making it the
future of their video editing applications. Some of that interface has made it
into Aperture 3’s design. The slideshow editor feels lifted straight out of
iMovie. The more I look at Aperture 3, the more I hope that Final Cut Pro 8
looks more like it than FCP 1.2.5. At the very least, it would be nice for the
two applications to have better integration so videos organized in Aperture
could be easily worked with in Final Cut. Given how related our SLRs and our
video cameras are these days, this seems to be an inevitability.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, Apple put a bombastic splash screen up on their webpage, promising
today would be a day we would never forget. The web exploded with buzz about
major changes coming to iTunes, though by the evening it became clear that the
impending announcement was the introduction of the Beatles’ catalogue to the
iTunes Store. Early this morning, that turned out to be true, the prolific
rock group’s entire oeuvre showed up sporting special features galore. It’s a
good looking collection, but was it worth hijacking the front page of the
world’s largest music reseller for 24 hours?</p>

<p>First of all, it’s important to understand the history of Apple’s relationship
with the Beatles. All of the Beatles albums are owned by Apple Corp., a
company that predates Apple (née Computer) Inc. by about a decade. The two
have sparred in court for decades, most recently after Apple entered the music
business with the introduction of the iPod. The “Beatles on iTunes” story has
been floating around the tech world for years, and is probably the last of the
major Apple rumors of the last decade (the tablet and the phone/PDA being the
others).  That it has been put to rest <em>is</em> a big deal given the contentious
history.</p>

<p>Apple now serves up 256 kbps (kilobits per second) AAC files to its many
listeners. Most people aren’t audiophiles, not to mention the fact that most
don’t even have the equipment to tell the difference between bitrates. Still,
there is something to be said for lower compression, higher quality formats,
like Apple Lossless, which is basically a high bitrate AAC file. The biggest
problem with any compressed file is that you can’t fill in the missing bits
later. With a CD (also digital, but with very little compression), when you
have enough storage to up your bitrate from 256 to 320, it’s only a matter of
re-ripping the disc. I had hoped that Apple’s big announcement today was going
to be the introduction of Beatles content for purchase as Apple Lossless
files, with other artists to follow.</p>

<p>Compression is a tricky business, especially considering that formats,
wrappers, and encoders will come and go throughout the course of history. Who
knows if we’ll still be able to play AAC files in the future, or if we’ll even
want to? All I know is that I’m much happier having The Beatles’ albums as
Apple Lossless on my hard drive, ripped from the CDs which I keep safely
tucked away. They sound wonderful.</p>

<p><strong>A final thought:</strong> iTunes originally sold 128 kbps audio for their entire store until they changed everything over to 256 kbps last year. When files doubled in quality, Apple offered purchasers the ability to upgrade to the newer, better format at a discounted rate. It’s an interesting model, and one consumers should get used to in a climate where formats will continue to change. That being said, if one had bought the CD in the first place, one wouldn’t have to worry about paying for anything again.</p>
