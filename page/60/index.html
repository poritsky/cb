  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/01/hulu-ad-swap.png" title="The Power of Choice" /></p>

<p>Yesterday, I wrote a quick post on how <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/15/hulus-revenue-up-60-percent/">Hulu really loves ads</a>. In it, I said “I don’t feel like the company respects me as a user.” I’d like to expand on that statement.</p>

<p>I stream content from a <a href="http://www.roku.com/roku-products">Roku LT</a>. On it I watch mostly Netlfix, for which I pay $17.98 for unlimited streaming and one Blu-ray out at a time per month, and Hulu Plus, which sets me back another $7.99. I can’t speak for the experience on other platforms, but on the Roku the Hulu Plus “channel”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is structured a lot like the company’s Web site. Most of the screen is filled with promoted content, while what you want to get at, the full Hulu library, is pushed to the bottom of the screen. The easiest way to get to a show you want to watch, even if you’ve been watching consecutive episodes of it for days, is to search for it with the on-screen keyboard. Netflix’s channel, in contrast, launches right into a list of everything you’ve watched recently, making it as easy as opening the channel to start watching something. This may be Roku’s problem, it may be Hulu’s, but it’s decidedly the inferior experience.</p>

<p>Then there are the ads. I knew they were going to be there even though I was paying for the service, but I didn’t think they’d be quite as bad as they are. On the Roku, there are significantly fewer ads than on cable or network television. While an ad runs there is a nice countdown clock in the upper left-hand corner that tells you when your program will start. Commercial breaks last anywhere from thirty seconds to two minutes.</p>

<p>There aren’t just fewer ads blocks per episode, there are fewer ads period. If I watch two episodes of the same show in a row (something that seems fundamental to the service), I will invariably see the same ad a few times. It gets annoying and makes me think Hulu barely considered what it’s actually like to try to settle into your couch for hours on end. If they’re trying to replicate the traditional television viewing experience, that’s the lens they should be looking through.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I missed this one:</p>

<blockquote><p>While we agree with the White House that protection against online piracy is vital, that protection must be meaningful to protect the people who have been and will continue to be victimized if legislation is not enacted. Meaningful legislation must include measured and reasonable remedies that include ad brokers, payment processors and search engines. They must be part of a solution that stops theft and protects American consumers.</p><p>We applaud the continued leadership in the House and Senate for working to enact common-sense legislation to stop foreign websites from stealing American creativity and jobs. Misinformation simply can&#8217;t be allowed to replace honest debate, and derail the critically important fight to protect American jobs.</p><footer><strong>Michael O&#8217;Leary, Senior Executive Vice President for Global Policy and External Affairs</strong> <cite><a href="http://blog.mpaa.org/BlogOS/post/2012/01/14/MPAA-Response-to-White-House-Position-on-Anti-Piracy-Legislation-.aspx">MPAA Blog</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>They didn’t leave a statement when Representative Lamar Smith and Senator Patrick Leahy <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/14/lamar-smith-and-patrick-leahy.html">backed off of DNS-blocking</a>. I gather that’s the “measured and reasonable” remedy they’re bemoaning here.</p>

<p>Why applaud Congress but chide the administration? And who <em>isn’t</em> having an honest debate?</p>

<p>Also, the MPAA’s blog looks awful. No wonder they don’t care if the Internet just shuts down.</p>

<p>I signed up for Hulu Plus this month to watch shows on my Roku LT and I have to tell you, I don&rsquo;t feel like the company respects me as a user.</p>

<p>Other highlights include that revenue in 2011 was up 60% over 2010 to $420 million and Hulu Plus now has 1.5 million subscribers (see chart below). I can think of at least one way they can get more subscribers and, but they really love those friggin&rsquo; ads.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Zoller Seitz forgot his laptop charger so he wrote two movie reviews in pen.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though: I found that because I was writing with a pen, I spent less time revising I went and instead spent that time thinking about what I wanted to say, because as you all know, if you write continuously for too long, your hand starts to cramp. And I probably spent more time writing, or thinking about what I wanted to write, because I was disconnected from the Internet and could not check Facebook or Twitter or my various email accounts, or my blog, or anything else online.</p><footer><strong>-Matt Zoller Seitz</strong> <cite><a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/putting-pen-to-paper-the-virtues-of-analog-writing">Press Play</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Powering down may not be for everyone, but sometimes trying a different workflow can open your eyes up to how your mind actually works. It’s not quite the same as writing in pen, but this is how I feel about switching from Wordpress to Octopress.</p>

<p>I’m writing more because a layer of the process, managing the backend of the site, has been removed or pared down to its simplest form. I used to compulsively login to my Wordpress install anytime I was in front of a web browser. Now I just wander around the web until the urge to write hits me, and I do so in a text editor that only allows me to write.</p>

<p>But I don’t think I’ll be able to write whole posts in pen and transcribe them. Hopefully Matt will update us on how writing by hand is going after he tries it for a few more reviews.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Ms. Doran is an omnivore who likes movies light, dark and in between. But when she attended the Austin Film Festival last year, “something I found both terribly sad and terribly sympathetic,” she recently recalled, “is that aspiring screenwriters ask again and again, ‘What can I write that a financier wants to make?’ Not, ‘What can I write that fills me with joy?’”</p><p>After reading the book “Flourish,” by Martin E. P. Seligman, a catalyst of the positive-psychology movement, she began rewatching films through the lens of what Dr. Seligman identifies as the five essential <a href="http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/Default.aspx">elements of well-being</a>: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishment. (He refers to these elements collectively as perma.)</p></blockquote>

<p>So happy to see Carrie Rickey have a piece in the Times. She was “my” film critic growing up in the Philadelphia Inquirer where she worked full-time <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2011-10-16/news/30286368_1_american-independent-filmmaking-sharon-pinkenson-linda-blackaby">until last October</a>. Great article on the application of positive psychology to screenwriting.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how I feel about Doran’s prescriptions yet, but it’s always nice to hear someone talk about writing a movie you love instead of one that’s easiest to market. Then again, most of the examples cited here are box office hits, so I’ll give this theory a hot minute before it just turns into another “get rich quick” formula by marketers.</p>

<p>The clarity of this statement from the Obama administration is a huge step forward for those opposed to the House&rsquo;s SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and the Senate&rsquo;s PIPA (PROTECT IP Act) bills. It reflects a real understanding of what&rsquo;s at stake, the freedom of expression that the Internet enables, while recognizing the core issues that have lead to the need for this kind of legislation, piracy.</p>

<p>I love this one line, so I&rsquo;ll re-quote it again. &ldquo;We expect and encourage all private parties, including both content creators and Internet platform providers working together, to adopt voluntary measures and best practices to reduce online piracy.&rdquo; That really should extend to consumers. The names of these bills are incredibly misleading, built to evoke sympathy and votes from those who don&rsquo;t understand technology, but if in fact the underlying goal is to &ldquo;stop online piracy,&rdquo; then maybe we should each look around our own house and see what we can do before the government does it for us.</p>

<p>This language from the White House is encouraging, but I get a sinking feeling that there&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t know happening in the background. Yesterday, Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas), SOPA&rsquo;s sponsor, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/14/lamar-smith-and-patrick-leahy.html">agreed to remove DNS-blocking from the bill</a>, which today&rsquo;s statement asks for explicitly. I have trouble believing the timing of these two events is a coincidence. I don&rsquo;t mean to get too tin-foil-hat on you, but my guess is that another shoe is going to drop soon, but it&rsquo;d be better if we all had a nice weekend first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love Dan Benjamin’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 network</a> of podcasts, and I try not to miss Merlin Mann’s “Back to Work” or John Gruber’s “The Talk Show.” So was I excited to find that on this week’s “Back to Work” Gruber and Merlin teamed up for an episode? You bet.</p>

<p>In the episode, titled “The Field of Completion,” the two cover everything from parenting to <em>Star Wars</em> to LEGO to commercials…everything.

<p>I read Daring Fireball every day. This is perhaps the best distillation of what it is that makes Gruber’s site so honest, enjoyable and engaging. The idea of painting a big picture, a “years long tapestry,” is actually why I keep reading <em>most</em> of the sites that I love.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’m going to aim to do here. Cinema runs a lot deeper than the weekly churn of receipts and press releases and who’s who lists, and that’s the story I want to tell. I hope I’m up to the task.</p>
