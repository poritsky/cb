  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>The California law would have imposed $1,000 fines on stores that sold violent video games to people under 18. It defined violent games as those “in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being” in a way that was “patently offensive,” appeals to minors’ “deviant or morbid interests” and lacked “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rightly, the justices recognize that the government isn’t built to determine what is of “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.” This is an issue that will, apparently, never go away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Susan Saladoff’s <em>Hot Coffee</em> may be 2011’s biggest “issues” documentary thus far. The title comes from one of the most notorious civil lawsuits in recent history, the 1992-1994 case of Stella Liebeck, then a 79-year-old woman who sued McDonald’s after she spilled hot coffee on herself. Liebeck became a punchline after a court awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. The case brought so-called “litigious lawsuits” to the national stage and set off two decades of reform which have in many ways crippled our access to the civil courts. Collectively, we all bought into the story that Liebeck took advantage of the system, but did she?</p>

<p><em>Hot Coffee</em> is not an exposé into the heat of McDonald’s coffee. In fact, the Liebeck case is only covered in the first 20 minutes or so of the film. That’s all it will take to convince viewers that the case was far from litigious. Liebeck required skin grafts on her upper thighs and racked up medical bills in the tens of thousands of dollars. As it turns out, McDonald’s training materials instructed employees to keep the coffee at 180 to 190 degrees. Worse, the company had received about 700 complaints about burns from their coffee and had done nothing about it. So Liebeck took the company to court and won. The jury decided punitive damages would act as a warning to the corporation to change its practices, which they ultimately did. Saladoff starts from the beginning and reexplains our justice system to audiences. This may seem like overkill but it’s vital to the point of the film. Our opinions about the civil court system have been tainted so severely that most viewers will be mystified by how it works and how it could work.</p>

<p>The film is broken up into four sections. Part one ,of course, is about Stella. The second section is far more heartbreaking. It revolves around the Gourleys, a Nebraska family who was awarded $5.6 million in a malpractice case. Due to their doctor’s negligence, one of their twins was born with severe brain damage. Once the jury awarded them the amount, which would have covered their son Colin’s care. The problem? Nebraska had caps on lawsuit damages in place set at $1.25 million. Ironically, unable to afford Colin’s medical bills, the Gourleys had to apply for Medicaid. In the end, the taxpayers are paying for a doctor’s gross negligence even though a jury decided otherwise.</p>

<p>Next up is the story of Oliver Diaz, a Mississippi Supreme Court justice who was considered anti-business (by businesses). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce ran a massive smear campaign against Diaz, spending untold amounts of money to get him booted from the court. When that didn’t work and he actually won the election, they drowned him in lawsuits, charging him with accepting bribes and tax evasion. He was acquitted on everything they threw at him, but not only did it mar his reputation, it also kept him from serving on the bench. Around three years of his term had been spent defending his name instead of serving the people of Mississippi. All because he wasn’t considered friendly to big business.</p>

<p>Finally, the most heart-wrenching story of the film involves the ongoing case of Jamie Leigh Jones, a former Halliburton employee who was drugged and brutally raped while working for the company in Iraq. When she arrived there, she found she was to be living in a barrack full of men instead of with other women as she was promised. When she complained the human resources department ignored her. After the rape occurred, Halliburton moved her to a storage container with armed guard outside while they could, presumably, figure out their stance. The story seems almost unimaginable, but what is worse is that Jones’ contract with Halliburton stipulated that any complaints against the company could not be brought to court. Instead she could go to mandatory arbitration. The arbitrator found in favor of Halliburton, which meant that she would have no justice for the incident.</p>

<p>Senator Al Franken of Minnesota took up Jones’ plight and introduced an amendment to a 2010 defense appropriations bill which restricts the kinds of situations in which defense contractors can use mandatory arbitration. The bill passed, and shortly thereafter it was decided that Jones could in fact seek her day in court. The civil lawsuit is now underway. The senate hearings, which appear in the film, are some of the most compelling footage I’ve ever seen from within the Capitol. It is relatively simple cinematographically, but the angle cinematographer Martina Radwan chooses is far more interesting than those normally used by C-SPAN and the like. Editor Cindy Lee, whose biggest claim to fame is editing the 2007 documentary <em>No End in Sight</em>, deftly slices the scene as Jones appears before the Senate. It’s the kind of thing we almost never get to see: plainspoken heroism in Washington. If we could see our goverment from this angle all of the time, perhaps far fewer people would feel disaffected about the system.</p>

<p>There is no question that <em>Hot Coffee</em> is an emotionally charged film. Its title is provocative enough, but it doesn’t do the film justice. This isn’t about one case but many. Moreover, this isn’t about the plight of few but the suffering of us all. As the film points out, the justice system in this country is the only branch of government that every American has access to. You can write to your senators and congresspeople, or to the President for that matter, but it is only within the courts that the average American can take on an insurmountable force like McDonald’s and win. For a brief period, the pendulum swung on the side of the citizens. Was that such a bad thing? Now, we find ourselves in a time when corporations have begun shutting down our access to the courts.</p>

<p>Whatever your stance on perennially hot button issues like tort reform or caps on damages or even the temperature of a cup o’ joe, <em>Hot Coffee</em> is a film that all Americans should watch. It will start out by changing your mind about Stella Liebeck, and then it will open your eyes to a host of other issues. Hopefully, this can be the kind of film that moves people to action. If <em>Super Size Me</em> could eradicate the phrase “Super Size” then surely something could from Saladoff’s film.</p>

<p>Hot Coffee <em>premieres tonight, Monday, June 27, 2011, at 9 p.m. on HBO. For more information visit the film’s <a href="http://hotcoffeethemovie.com/">official website</a>.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>Although FCPX was built from scratch, and not from the iMovie codebase, it’s clear that Randy [Ubillos]’s vision for a revolutionary new way to manage media (and find the right clip), as well as edit video footage, is at the very foundation of Final Cut Pro X.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, the people calling Final Cut Pro X “iMovie Pro” are wrong…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phenomenal read from DVcreators.net’s Josh Mellicker. It’s long but every single paragraph is some of the most cogent writing on the subject of the new Final Cut available.</p>

<p>The biggest scoop in there is Ubillos’s “First Cut” software idea which later became iMovie ‘08:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So Randy starting writing an app: “First Cut”, a professional-level “feeder” app for Final Cut Pro. You would launch First Cut, import all your raw footage, then quickly skim through, keywording, organizing, marking as good or rejecting, and finally building a rough edit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This actually sounds like an incredibly useful app, especially if this were to exist on the iPad. A lot to think about…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friday night, on my way home from a night on the town, I boarded an uptown
express train around 9:30pm. It was a moderately crowded car but I found a
seat right away, right by the door. I like sitting there because then I only
have to sit next to one (potentially stinky) stranger instead of two.</p>

<p>After I’d been happily riding the train for about five stops, listening to
music on my iPhone and clacking away on my iPad, I felt a tap on my shoulder.
I looked up and there was an NYPD officer trying to get my attention. I took
out my headphones to listen. He told me that I was in the worst possible seat
to be using a tablet (“You’re in the wrong seat for that.”) because someone
could just poke their head in the doorway and yank it out of my hands. I
nodded and went back to my writing, to which I got a real nasty look from the
officer, who indicated I really better put it away that instant.</p>

<p>Erring on the side of “I don’t need this right now,” I tucked my iPad into by
bag and started typing out this piece on my iPhone. Initially, I was a bit
indignant at the suggestion that using an iPad in public was inviting thieves
to take my stuff, but I understand where the NYPD is coming from. They’re
simply trying to preach good preventative measures so that there is less
crime, thereby less headaches for them. This is the same police department
that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/06/10/nypd-sez-dont-wear-those-ipod-
headphones/">discouraged people from wearing Apple’s iconic white
headphones</a> as it is indicated the wearer was using an iPod, thus making them
a worthwhile mugging target. It makes sense, but only to a point.</p>

<p>Personal safety and security is always going to be a concern, and not just for
technology. What I find confusing about the NYPD’s logic here is that one may
as well not sit near the door at all. Couldn’t someone pop in to take your
bag, your wallet, your watch? Are you actually safer further inside the car or
is there another set of survival rules one must abide there? I’m not trying to
be funny here, I’m just trying to follow the NYPD’s thread. Is the issue that
using technology in public is an obviously stupid move? Or is it that riding
the subway at all is something of a free for all?</p>

<p>An iPod at least is small enough for a pickpocket to take without your
noticing (although if you’re listening to it and you don’t notice it’s gone,
there are other issues) but an iPad is bulky enough that you could at least
report it or cause enough of a ruckus to get an officer involved. Anyway, I’m
not discouraged from using my iPad or reading a book or holding anything in my
hands while I stand near the door.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth I generally feel very safe on New York City subways, safer
than I ever felt on Philadelphia’s subway. I suppose that’s why I’m surprised
that this officer went so far as to draw attention to the fact that I
apparently <em>would</em> get mugged if I kept on writing on my iPad.</p>

<p>I’m posting to see if any other readers have had an experience in which the
police suggested having an electronic out in public was asking for trouble.
Worse, has anyone actually had anything stolen in this manner? It has to be a
problem if the NYPD has come up with a plan, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Khoi Vinh:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two years ago, <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2009/02/22/best-super-hero-movie">in a post about “The Dark Knight,”</a> I compared the contemporary super-hero actioner to the Hollywood western. Like that once-dominant genre, super-hero films get little respect today but, I argued, they’ll one day become a routine vehicle for serious artistic ambitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Vinh’s got things a bit backwards here. In the past decade this genre has wielded <em>more</em> respect than at any point in its history. Most of the big action directors today came from small, independent backgrounds. Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, Bryan Singer, Christopher Nolan and even Jon Favreau didn’t exactly seem like obvious choices for their respective blockbusters. It’s not that the day for artistic super-hero films is coming, it’s that it has come and gone.</p>

<p>Plus, there are a lot of shitty westerns.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Midnight in Paris</em> is yet another example of Woody Allen’s uncanny ability to balance romance with cynicism, the magical with the realistic. Magic is almost a religion in his films, a cosmic force against which his characters are seemingly powerless. <em>You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger</em>, <em>Scoop</em>, <em>Melinda and Melinda</em> and even <em>Match Point</em> rely on the metaphysical for a narrative push. The list goes on (<em>Deconstructing Harry</em>, <em>Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors</em>, <em>Mighty Aphrodite</em>, <em>The Purple Rose of Cairo</em>, <em>Interiors</em> and more), but we have a film to discuss.<br />
Here we have a writer, Gil (Owen Wilson), on vacation in Paris with his fiancé
Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her wealthy parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy).
Each night he wanders the streets alone only to be wisped away to Paris of the
1920s, where he rubs elbows with Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrude
Stein (Kathy Bates) and Salvador Dalí (Adrien Brody) among others. Trying to
give up being a Hollywood hack and move into novel writing, Gil latches onto
his heroes during his late-night transdimensional excursions after being
accepted into their inner circle. He also gets close with a mysterious
Parisian, Adriana (Marion Cotillard), the pursuit of apparently every artisan
of the day.</p>

<p>Back in the modern world, where Gil spends his days, he and Inez are trying to
enjoy their privileged life as tourists in France, though it grows
increasingly difficult once they run into American friends Paul (Michael
Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). Paul is an expert on everything, even things
he knows very little about. He may or may not be Gil’s intellectual superior,
but Inez is clearly convinced his words hold more weight than Gil’s prattling.
He tries to bring Inez with him to the 1920s, but is unable to and so he is
stuck with her as she is in 2010, cynical, bored and unappreciative of walking
in the rain.</p>

<p>The smarter-than-he-realizes-out-of-work creative and the hardbodied-
overbearing-unsupportive girlfriend may be Allen staples (see: Josh Brolin and
Naomi Watts, Will Ferrell and Amanda Peet) but Owen Wilson brings something
different to the table than the rest of Allen’s male protagonists. He is,
well, he’s stupider but more virtuous than the others. His romantic view of
the world makes him seem like a child, a quality that also allows him to
recognize, unlike most Allen leads, the difference between right and wrong
(for the most part).</p>

<p>I’ve heard idle chatter that this is a breakout performance for Wilson, but I
think that’s patently false. He explored vacuity brilliantly in Ben Stiller’s
<em>Zoolander</em> as Hansel, the idiotic male model who is enemy-cum-sidekick to the
title character. Gil and Hansel are more similar than they are different;
Allen simply helps hone Wilson’s likable silliness into something a role
eminently more interesting than, say, John Beckwith of <em>Wedding Crashers</em>.</p>

<p>Many would like to categorize Allen’s work, perhaps saying he’s a comedian
first and a dramatist second. <em>Midnight in Paris</em> doesn’t really fall under
either, or at least benefits from his experience in both worlds. He trusts his
audience enough to enter another era without having to explain the science
behind time travel. He is also able to imbue the four epochs he enters with
enough charm to not feel the need to overdo the “now we are in the 1920s”
effect. I wouldn’t call it subtle, but it is far from over the top a la
Stephen Fry’s <em>Bright Young Things</em>. Whenever we approach cliché, Allen
capitulates to the audience that they are experiencing a plot point, winking
at us as he follows sometimes damning conventions so we know it’s part of his
scheme.</p>

<p>At its core, this is a film about nostalgia, its values and its pitfalls.
Woody Allen fans may be even more nostalgic than the director himself, often
clambering for him to return to the form that he is best known for from the
1970s and 1980s. Even though the bulk of his films share the same aging
Windsor typeface (which has virtually no other purpose in our era than for his
title cards) and soundtracks of classical and golden age jazz music, he has
never stopped moving forward. <em>Midnight in Paris</em> is on track to become
Allen’s most successful box office take ever, an indication that his audience
is growing instead of depleting as is often assumed. That feeling that he
should go back to making films like the ones he is best known for is driven by
an unshakable nostalgia for bygone days. In actuality, he continues to make
great work. How long until we look back on 2011 and wonder whether Allen will
make films like the good old days again?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Smart analysis from Winston Hearn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…it is crazy to me that everyone thinks because nothing has come out of
Apple in 48 hours, nothing will come out of them, or that they do not care
about professionals. If that were the case, we would not have seen FCPX.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Winston hits Apple’s modus operandi on the head. When they respond to
consumers, it will be decisive, but they are not going to put a knee-jerk
band-aid on the FCP X release.</p>

<p>Still, I think Winston’s implication that releasing FCP X means that Apple
cares about professionals points to the reason for the backlash. Most pros are
worried that they aren’t the target market for FCP X. <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/23/enter-the-casual-editor/">I’m starting to agree
with them.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the latest move of Japanese pop toward virtual or fictional stars, the newest addition to a Japanese girl group with millions of superfans turns out not to be real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating development in terms of what people view as real and unreal. I think virtual characters are only going to accelerate as time goes on. Wondering whether or not a character is real or not will be a conversation for old people, much like the generation before mine never quite understood how meaningful conversations could happen over IRC/AIM/chat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps when I said the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/21/final-cut-pro-x-doesnt-do-
what/">release of Final Cut Pro X felt
botched</a>, I was jumping to a specific conclusion because of the way I use FCP
today. In my day to day work, I require high-end tape-based input and output
from Final Cut. I’m an edge case and FCP X might not be for me, but who is it
for?</p>

<p>I think the price tag says everything you need to know about who Apple sees as
its core market. At $299, it’s no longer the high end niche product it was
when Final Cut Studio cost $1000. When I postulated that <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/11/17/final-
aperture-pro-an-idea-for-whats-to-come/">FCP would take most
of its cues from Aperture</a>, I never considered price tag or
target markets; I was only thinking in terms of interface and usability. The
bigger picture, from Apple’s perspective, is how many units they can move, and
there is a much bigger market for non-professional filmmakers than there ever
will be for full time editors. Much in the same way that Aperture appeals to
photographers of all levels, Final Cut Pro X is meant to be accessible to
folks who are unfamiliar with the antiquated ways of tape-based workflows. It
is for the casual editor.</p>

<h2 id="defining-casual">Defining Casual</h2>

<p>The term “casual gamer” has become relatively commonplace over the last few
years, best exemplified by the runaway success that is the Nintendo Wii.
Debuting in 2006, the Nintendo gave up on the processing arms race its two
biggest competitors, Microsoft and Sony, had been engaged in. Instead, they
released a lower-powered machine with an innovative interface. The Wii remote
represented a paradigm shift in gaming). This was a videogame system that
grandma could play. Nintendo discovered an untapped market and used it to
bludgeon the competition. The casual gamer wasn’t just born, it became <em>the</em>
market to go after.</p>

<p>I believe that Apple is looking to sell Final Cut Pro X to casual editors,
people who now lug around video in their phones and their still cameras,
unaware of what to do with it. Filmmakers who would rather just jump in and
start cutting without taking the time to learn the historic language of film;
who will never have to understand what a “bin” is. They just want something
that will let them get creative with their footage to an extent that iMovie
can no longer handle.</p>

<p>Apple isn’t coming out of left field with this move. Look at the way
professional video cameras have progressed over the last 20 years. They have
dropped in price and compromised classically professional features in order to
get them in the hands of consumers. The result has been a revolution in
independent cinema. Panasonic in particular has aggressively gone after the
“prosumer” market and won over many filmmakers even though many of their
products have been technologically inferior to the competition. Apple is
trying to bring the accessibility and availability revolution of film
production tools to post production. The casual editor is tomorrow’s filmmaker
and Apple is looking to that future.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-hardcore">What About Hardcore?</h2>

<p>In the gaming analogue, hardcore gamers are the ones who drove the market back
when gaming was something of a niche. They desired better graphics, more
power, more buttons, more intense gameplay. Sony and Microsoft engaged with
them, but Nintendo sidestepped them completely. The accepted knowledge at the
time was that you didn’t want to irk the core; they’re the audience who spends
money on consoles.</p>

<p>As the Wii reached ubiquity, hardcore gamers felt like they had been abandoned
by one of the progenitors of their obsession. But did Nintendo abandon them?
For all its blemishes, the Wii was still able to run great titles that even
the most cynical hardcore player could find enjoyment in. It became
commonplace for gamers to have more than one console in their house, and that
was okay too. They could get their fix on the XBox and then goof off with the
Wii.</p>

<p>Following that thread, perhaps Final Cut Pro X is a new tool that can be used
for some projects but not for all of them. You can <del>ruin</del><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> run an
install of FCP X alongside FCP 7, so it’s conceivable that one will be used
for tape-based workflows while the other is relegated to low-end tapeless
projects. Where Apple made it’s biggest misstep was in replacing FCP 7 with
FCP X (you can no longer buy FCP 7) when really, it apparently is a different
toolset.</p>

<h2 id="a-final-word-on-fear-mongering">A Final Word on Fear Mongering</h2>

<p>Editors whose livelihood depends on Final Cut have plenty to think about at
this juncture, but I think it takes it too far to say FCP X kills the product
altogether. Editors are talking about moving to another NLE, and that’s fine,
but it doesn’t seem fair to treat FCP X as unusable. It will find its footing
and, hopefully, become the best available editor for most projects out there.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro 7 still works today and it should work for a long time to come.
Of course, one never knows when Apple will start phasing it out. Since it is
based on legacy code, support could be dropped in a future version of OS X,
but it will still work in 10.7 Lion and that should take you a few years into
the future. By the time support is dropped, FCP X should be up to snuff.</p>

<p>Or not.</p>

<p>My point is that you shouldn’t whine about Apple selling editors up the river
(the didn’t). Go find a tool that works for you and make great work. You can
bet the casual editors of the world will.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve personally been following Apple’s keynotes and releases for about twelve
years, and in that time I’ve never seen a release get as botched as today’s
rollout of Final Cut Pro X, Motion 5 and Compressor 4. Cupertino has done a
terrible job of managing expectations. Editors should be jumping <em>onto</em> a new
release, not jumping ship, but it seems like that’s what’s about to happen.</p>

<p>I should mention that I haven’t touched FCP X; I haven’t bought it yet and
haven’t seen anything more than the press materials and demos. However, I feel
pretty confident that tinker time would do nothing to change the sheer lack of
basic features in the newest release of FCP. From <a href="http://www.philiphodgetts.com/2011/06/what-are-the-answers-to-the-
unanswered-questions-about-final-cut-pro-x/">Philip
Hodgetts</a> here’s a brief smattering of what
Final Cut Pro X version 1 <strong><em>can’t</em></strong> do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ingest Red R3D Media * Import FCP 6 or 7 projects * Capture footage from pro tape formats * Do a non-crash-capture from Firewire tapes * Output tapes * Support third party plugins * Multi-cam editing * Import/Export XML or EDL files<br />
I’d like to join others and give Apple the benefit of the doubt that these
things will be slowly rolling out in time. To be fair, they’ve done a complete
rewrite of the app in Cocoa 64-bit, which means all third-party support,
including video in/out cards, goes out the window until developers get their
code in line with the new FCP X. Still, this is a lot of missing stuff for day
one. No tape workflows?</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple is clearly looking to the future. So many productions have gone
tapeless, but most workflows don’t revolve around DSLR H.264 files which
appears to be all Final Cut Pro X is built for today. No support for Red, Arri
Alexa or XDCAM (sans transcodes outside of FCP X)? That’s a big pill to
swallow.</p>

<p>Apple has to roll out updates soon, like by the end of the summer soon, or
else people will head to Avid in droves. We were all ready for the next wave
in video editing, but there’s just too much missing from this release to make
it a production tool today.</p>

<p>All that being said, it still does look like a sick interface that will be
great for a lot of people. If you do shoot on DSLRs there is no better option
available. I can’t wait to get my hands on it and shove some D90 footage into
it and write a more well-rounded reaction.</p>
