  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2013/4/18/slugline.html">Stu Maschwitz announced Slugline</a>, a <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a> screenwriting app. Slugline (<a href="http://slugline.co">check out the official site</a>) has been in development almost since the earliest rumblings of Fountain. I have had the great privilege of using it throughout the beta, watching it grow into the powerful app it is today.</p>

<p>Slugline allows you to write in Fountain while making your script look like a formatted screenplay. It’s like Final Draft without all the headaches. It’s magic. And since your documents are always in plain text, you can take them with you anywhere.</p>

<p>I’ll be publishing a more detailed piece soon, so stay tuned. Slugline is on the Mac App Store For $39.99. You could buy it six times over and still be short of buying Final Draft. <a href="http://bit.ly/mas-slugline">Go get it</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and write a movie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let’s keep playing around with <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses III</a>, shall we? I <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/04/09/ulysses-iii-review/">rather enjoy writing in it</a>, and I like seeing the finished, formatted version of my work in <a href="http://markedapp.com">Marked</a>. I created some custom themes for Marked to match Ulysses’ color schemes (available for download at the bottom of this post). First, though, a few words on using Marked with Ulysses.</p>

<p>Here’s how The Soulmen answer “Is there a Markdown preview?” in their FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In External Sources, you can directly preview Markdown files. Right-click on a sheet and open it in your favorite Markdown processor. We can recommend Brett Terpstra’s wonderful Marked app for this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said in my review, external sources don’t really offer you the full Ulysses experience. The product page is careful to mention that Marked is only supported with external sources, since they’re just loose documents on your hard drive; they would work with Marked no matter what. However, I can be less cautious: only external sources <em>fully</em> support Marked preview.</p>

<p>Full Marked support, by my measure, means the document will update live while you’re editing it. At present Marked does not support opening the raw text document at the core of your Ulysses sheet, so live updating is out.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> You can, however, export the current sheet directly to Marked, where it will be formatted like any other Markdown document. You won’t be able to live update as you type, but you can manually push your edits to Marked.</p>

<p>All you have to do is access the quick export popover in the top right-hand corner of Ulysses. When you click it, select the text tab, then make sure you Markdown selected as your format. Hover over the “Open In…” button so a down-arrow appears just to the right of it. A list of available editors will pop down. Choose Marked.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/qe-marked.jpg" title="Ulysses Quick Export" /></p>

<p>Marked will open up your current sheet. Doing the same thing again will push any new edits to the document in Marked. The “Open In…” button will retain the previous app you used for quick export, which in my case will almost always be Marked. Now I can expedite pushing changes to Marked by hitting ⌘6 to bring up the quick export popover. If the middle button is highlighted blue and says “Open in Marked” all I have to do is hit return and it will push the changes. If not I can use directional arrows to move to the correct button.</p>

<p>This works on glued sheets as well. You can also highlight a bunch of sheets and do a quick export; Marked will see them as one long document, just as you see them in Ulysses.</p>

<p>In practice I rarely use live updating in Marked anymore. I only use it to read through longer pieces in a proportional typeface, to get myself in a proofreading mood. I’d like to see live Marked support come in a future update, but I’m perfectly happy knowing I can get to it from the keyboard in two clicks.</p>

<p>Now about those themes. My personal favorite is the Freestraction theme that ships with Ulysses. It’s easy on the eyes in both light and dark modes, so I decided to copy it for two custom Marked themes. Here they are:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/freestraction-light.png" title="Ulysses Freestraction Light" /></p>
<p><div align="center">Ulysses Freestraction Light</div></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/freestraction-dark.png" title="Ulysses Freestraction Dark" /></p>
<p><div align="center">Ulysses Freestraction Dark</div></p>

<p><a href="http://cl.ly/2i0a1I132g04/download/Ulysses%20III%20Themes%20for%20Marked.zip"><strong>Download Ulysses Themes for Marked</strong></a></p>

<p>The following installation instructions are lifted right off of the <a href="http://markedapp.com">Marked product page</a> (at the very bottom):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save the CSS file to a safe place such as ~/Library/Application Support/Marked/Custom CSS</li>
  <li>In Marked Preferences, go to the Styles pane</li>
  <li>Use the plus button to add a new style, locate your CSS file and hit “OK”</li>
  <li>Your style will be named based on the name of the CSS file, and will now be available in the Style dropdown menus</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy writing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/04/09/ulysses-iii-review/">my review</a>, universal search is not currently implemented in Ulysses III. I’ve got an <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> Workflow that picks up the slack on that front until The Soulmen ship an update. It allows for full text, sheet and group name search. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/uly-alfred.jpg" title="Ulysses Search in Alfred" /></p>

<p>Type <code>uly</code> and your query, then pick your group or sheet and it will open in Ulysses. Easy peasy.</p>

<p>Note that this will only search sheets and groups stored in iCloud or On My Mac. Daedalus documents are stored as text documents with a hash for a title, so the results look (in a word) crazy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> External documents are external; deal with them externally.</p>

<p><strong>**Bonus:**</strong> This Alfred workflow adds a File Action for opening Text and RTF documents in Ulysses. When triggered, it will import the document to your Inbox, and even convert the rich text to Markdown for you. Neato.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Worse: if you were to open a text document in Ulysses, it wouldn’t take you to what you’re looking for, just import the document again to your Inbox.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In college I bought a copy of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>. <a href="http://amzn.to/10xoDmv">This stately, plump tome</a>, to be exact. I didn’t read it. I tried to, sure, but after a few weeks it became clear I needed to move on.</p>

<p>Every few years I start reading it again from the beginning, each time making it a bit further than my last attempt; never very far. Up until this latest release, <a href="http://www.the-soulmen.com">The Soulmen’s</a> text editor that shares a title with Joyce’s novel was only too aptly named for me. It never clicked. That’s all changed with <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses III</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-organized">Getting Organized</h3>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/20/my-text-problem/">written before</a> about how most editors get in my way. In praising <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a>, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/03/drafts-for-iphone/">I wrote this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nearly every app I use on iOS utilizes the same basic “document” model. Whatever I write usually needs a name and/or tags so that it can be differentiated from the other documents. As such, I couldn’t open an app and start writing without feeling like I was <em>working on something</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more writing feels like work, like a chore to me, the less I feel like doing it. On iOS, Drafts solved this problem. On the Mac, the closest thing to an app that allows me to just aimlessly write has been <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a>. I use and love nvALT, but for notes, little snippets of information I may need access to later. I never launch it just to write.</p>

<p>Ulysses III puts writing front and center, doing away with the “document” model. Instead, you compose text in “sheets” which can be organized into “groups” (basically folders). A sheet doesn’t need a title, though you can add one with a Markdown header. There is an Inbox where you can compose loose bits of text for later organization or just get to writing.</p>

<p>All of this gets stored in the Ulysses database, which has its advantages. For one, you don’t need to clutter up your file system with snippets of text. By keeping your writing in Ulysses, you can add attachments to sheets, including photos, notes and keywords (or tags). These items follow your sheet no matter where you file it.</p>

<p>Filters allow you to create a search folder, similar to a smart mailbox in Mail. You can search the full text of documents in your entire Ulysses database, or limit the search to a single group by, say, keyword or modification date.</p>

<p>I’m using filters right now. I’ve got a few sheets for different sections of this review. Some sheets have the keyword <code>@first-draft</code> attached to them, some have <code>@second-draft</code> and some both. I’ve got filters limited to my Ulysses Review group for each keyword, so I can view each draft separately. By doing this, I’m able to edit the same sheet in both drafts, which jibes with my brain more than making multiple copies of the same text.</p>

<p>Ulysses III also makes the best use of OS X’s Versions feature I’ve seen in an organized writing app. Hitting ⌘S in any sheet will save a version of it in its current state. This again obviates making multiple copies of the same sheet, allowing you to simply go into the <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4753">Versions browser</a> to see previous edits. This is the first implementation of Versions I’ve actually wanted to use.</p>

<h3 id="editing-text">Editing Text</h3>

<p>Out of the box Ulysses ships with syntax highlighting for John Gruber’s original <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, an extended syntax they’re calling Markdown XL<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and Textile<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. From there you can create your own syntaxes and set up your own highlighting color schemes and keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>Most of the highlighting is pretty basic (*italics* are <em>italic</em>, **bolds** are <strong>bold</strong>), but some elements become invisible. Link text, for example, is displayed with a colorful halo around it with the URL embedded, accessible in a popover. You can create a link by surrounding text with square brackets or with the keyboard shortcut ⌘L.</p>

<p>Ulysses III is stunning to look at. It’s not distraction-free-douchy, but it definitely gets out of your way to let you focus on writing. Have a look at it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/ulysses-3.png" title="Ulysses 3 Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Ulysses 2 looks comparatively:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/ulysses-2.png" title="Ulysses 2 Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Each of the two panes on the left side of Ulysses III can be folded underneath the editor window, allowing you to only focus on the document at hand. It’s simple and delightful to watch the app animate into place, which you can quickly invoke with ⌘1 (all panes), ⌘2 (Editor and current group) and ⌘3 (Editor only). In each view, the app will grow from the center out as opposed to treating the sidebar panes as drawers. This feels logical, though it’s the first use of such an animation I’ve seen in any Mac app.</p>

<h3 id="the-kitchen-sync">The Kitchen Sync</h3>

<p>Where Ulysses III really wins me over is its sync implementation. The app offers three sync options: iCloud, Daedalus and External Sources. There is also an On My Mac mode which keeps documents on your Mac, un-synced, though I’ve turned this off for the time being. Each comes with its own set of caveats. Let me try to lay them out simply:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>iCloud:</strong> Mac-to-Mac syncing. Makes full use of the features described above as it syncs the entire Ulysses database.
    <ul>
      <li>Documents have to live in the Ulysses database, meaning they are not editable by other applications until you export them.</li>
      <li>Identical to On My Mac, except items are synced.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Daedalus:</strong> Mac-to-iOS syncing (via iCloud) for use with <a href="http://daedalusapp.com">Daedalus Touch</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>No support for custom syntaxes, only straight Markdown.</li>
      <li>No support for nested groups, attachments or filters (this makes some sense if you’re familiar with Daedalus’ interface).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>External Sources:</strong> Allows you to read and write documents from anywhere on your system, like your <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> folder.
    <ul>
      <li>No support for custom syntaxes, groups, filters or attachments.</li>
      <li>Will only parse Markdown text for documents with the extension <code>.md</code>; <code>.txt</code> documents need to be converted to <code>.md</code> to allow for syntax highlighting.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer a Dropbox text editor on iOS like <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/ipad/">iA Writer</a>, <a href="http://bywordapp.com">Byword</a> or <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a>, then you can use the external sources mode to edit your documents in Ulysses. However, this is the most stripped down experience you can have in Ulysses III. I think it’s a nice feature if you don’t use Daedalus Touch, but I think users trying to fit Ulysses into their workflow with it will end up being disappointed.</p>

<p>The sync with Daedalus Touch is phenomenal. I love being able to make edits on any device and have it stay in sync on all of them. In my experience iCloud does a much better job than Dropbox at keeping documents up to date. I can leave Ulysses open, even to the document I’m editing with Daedalus on my iPhone, and the changes will stay consistent, intelligently.</p>

<p>I’ve had varying degrees of success keeping sheet order in sync across devices. Right now if I reorder sheets in a stack on my iPad it will reorder the sheets on my Mac and iPhone, even while I’m looking at them. I’ve had less luck going the other way, though in my testing, like I said, I’m staring at my devices watching paint dry. Even from the last version of the beta I used sync has improved exponentially; I imagine edge case bugs like this will get squashed in future updates.</p>

<p>I’ve turned the On My Mac header off in the sidebar (you can also do away with iCloud and Daedalus, if you please). My thinking here is that I want to keep my documents in sync via iCloud. Technically my documents are still “on my Mac,” just in the Mobile Documents folder. There has been a lot of hubbub about iCloud being a terrible product, but I’m enamored of it for document syncing. I use CrashPlan to constantly back up my Mac, including the Mobile Documents folder, so I feel confident that, should something go awry, I’ll always be able to restore my Ulysses database. And for documents I’m extra worried about, I can always export them.</p>

<h3 id="whats-missing">What’s Missing</h3>

<p>Ulysses III is a 1.0 app. Since they wrote a brand new app from the ground up, some aspects of Ulysses 2 are missing. The biggest one you need to know about right now is universal search. You can search for text in a single sheet, but at present there is no way to search your entire database. The workaround right now is to create a filter with, but it’s not a real solution by any means.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> The Soulmen have promised this is coming in the future updates.</p>

<p>There is currently no support for auto-pairing of most characters. While ⌘I will surround your cursor with  asterisks, Ulysses doesn’t intelligently pair parentheses or back-ticks. Square brackets, in addition, will create a link popover. If you want to use actual square brackets, you’ll need to escape them with backslashes (<code>\[Like so\]</code>), which <em>is</em> annoying, but in practice I rarely use square brackets outside of links, which Ulysses handles well.  You can create TextExpander snippets to trigger auto-pairs, or you can create keyboard shortcuts for elements of custom syntaxes.</p>

<p>Typewriter scrolling and line highlighting didn’t make the cut for 1.0. I’d like to see keyboard shortcuts for the attachments menu, which is currently only accessible with the mouse. This makes sense for images, which have to be dragged into the app, but I’d like quicker access to keywords and notes. And it would be nice if they implemented  something similar to TextMate’s <a href="http://manual.macromates.com/en/working_with_multiple_files#moving_between_files_with_grace">Go to File…</a> menu, which allows for quick search without ever taking your hands off the keyboard. These missing items may be deal-breakers for some, but I’m making do without them. What I get in sync-ability and organization more than makes up for it.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>I use Ulysses III for almost everything I write now. Long-form writing, aimless yammering, quick things I don’t want to forget; it’s all going into Ulysses or Daedalus. It’s solid, beautiful and simple. And it’s only going to get better.</p>

<p>The Soulmen have now completely reinvented themselves. Many established Mac developers have tried to make iOS versions of their biggest apps because users have been clamoring for it. When Daedalus launched in 2011, I noted in <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/02/daedalus-touch-brings-beautiful-text-editing-to-the-ipad/">my review</a> that they had actually been working on an app called Ulysses Mobile at the time. I applauded their resistance to shipping that product at the time, but I had no idea that Daedalus would in turn influence Ulysses.</p>

<p>Ulysses is <del>still on sale for $19.99 during their launch week event, but soon it will go up to</del> $39.99. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses-iii/id623795237?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">Go grab it</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and get back to writing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/siskel-and-ebert.jpg" title="Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert" /></p>

<p>Sad news: <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/17320958-418/roger-ebert-dies-at-70-after-battle-with-cancer.html">Roger Ebert has passed away</a>.</p>

<p>Writing on the Web had no greater champion than Ebert. He was encouraging, generous and humble. He didn’t care about the masthead under which your writing appeared. He would share anything he came across and enjoyed. He took joy in using his celebrity to shine light on the work of others and make film criticism an ever-expanding field.</p>

<p>I was once the recipient of his generosity. On January 22, 2012, Roger posted two links to the candler blog on Twitter and Facebook. As if that weren’t enough of a gesture, he very kindly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RogerEbert/posts/284875718232348">said some nice things about me</a>. After that there was no going back for me; like it or not I was a writer online. Roger said so.</p>

<p>I bring up that experience because I know that he inspired many thousands as he did me. That may even be an understatement.</p>

<p>Besides his <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/10/eberts_little_rule_book.html">little rule book</a>, there is one piece of wisdom of his that is always in my mind. From his foreword to Nicholas Jarecki’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Breaking-In-Directors-Their-Start/dp/0767906748"><em>Breaking In: How 20 Film Directors Got Their Start</em></a>, which I read at a very impressionable age:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter if you go to film school or not, or which film school, or what you study. It doesn’t matter if you work on film or video, or what kind of camera you use. It doesn’t matter if you write in the morning, or at night, or on yellow pads or on a Macintosh. It doesn’t matter if you work as an intern or an apprentice, in Hollywood or Austin or anywhere else. It doesn’t matter what movies you watched or what books you read—as long as the answer is “a lot of them.” What matters is that you called yourself a movie director, and you made a movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, Roger. Your mark will be felt for generations to come.</p>
