  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dante Basco, who played Rufio in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 <em>Peter Pan</em> redux <em>Hook</em>, <a href="http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/188973-dante-rufio-basco-on-the-asian-pacific-film-fest-and-the-hook-prequel">speaking with CraveOnline</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rufio’s a great iconic character for a certain generation and definitely something I’m always associated with, proud to be associated with which is cool. Actually there’s a film in development, the Rufio film, where a hotshot group of kids from the East Coast graduated and they wrote this whole script, the prequel to <em>Hook</em> and it’s the Rufio story. We have it right now with a director, Rpin Suwannath who’s doing the new <em>Zorro</em> for Fox. He has the script and he’s attached to the film and I’m attached to produce so that’s actually in development right now which’ll be cool, a Rufio for a whole new generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a reboot I could get behind. The alternate Neverland put forth in that film was fantastic and a place that would be fun to return to. <del>Yet, while Basco has an incredibly youthful appearance<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, he is now 36; he was 16 in the original.</del></p>

<p>I’m most interested in the years after Pan’s departure, when Rufio rose to become the group’s skateboarding, swash-buckling id. <del>I’m not sure Basco can still pull off 16, and since you don’t age in Neverland, if he <em>were</em> to play an adult Rufio that would mean…[gulp]…they would have to rehash the plot of the original and have Rufio leave and return a weary old dad.</del></p>

<p><del>So I should rephrase. <em>Maybe</em> this is a reboot I could get behind.</del></p>

<p>I read this completely wrong the first time around. Basco is attached to produce, not star, at least not yet. So perhaps I’ll hold my tongue until I know more…and read it through thoroughly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/05/readlists.jpg" title="Readlists Logo" /></p>

<p>This morning, Arc90, makers of Readability<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, introduced <a href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a>. Here’s how they describe it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a Readlist? A group of web pages—articles, recipes, course materials, anything—bundled into an e-book you can send to your Kindle, iPad, or iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Users can create lists of great content they find around the Web and package them together into one group, which can then be shared, downloaded as an eBook or embedded on a Web site. Of course, each article can also be sent to Readability right from the Readlist page.</p>

<p>The site launched with a few featured lists, like this one from Jeffrey Zeldman dubbed “<a href="http://readlists.com/653bede6/">User First, Mobile First, Content First.</a>” When you create a Readlist, you can add a blurb describing the list. In Zeldman’s case, “Designing for a content-focused, increasingly mobile, browser- and device-agnostic web.” Then the articles are listed in numeric order (set by the Readlist creator) with title, author (if available), base URL and a short description of the piece which is pre-populated with 30-40 words of the linked material.</p>

<p>This feels like another service that tries to make sharing more convenient but, in so doing, helps silo the open Web. <a href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a> is another example of this. I often feel the impulse to document events I see unfolding in Storify, but whenever I get the urge I remember that I already have a platform for sharing such things: this Web site.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> </p>

<p>I realize not everyone wants to run their own Web site or blog, but it’s certainly nice to own the content you create. Putting together a list of relevant articles to read is no small thing, tantamount to putting together a syllabus or editing a scholarly compendium. Doing it isn’t that hard, but doing it well is. Taking that talent and giving it away is a shame.</p>

<p>Readlists isn’t for me, but I’m sure there is an audience for something like this. If you find yourself getting good at telling a story by stringing together disparate strands of knowledge and garnering an audience, I suggest you go out and plant a Web site somewhere. It won’t take much longer than reading this article.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every day, Roger Ebert picks a film that is available streaming online to share with his readers on social media. Tonight, he posted <a href="http://www.facebook.com/RogerEbert/posts/448410911838580">this message to his Facebook page</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>So let me get something straight. A while ago I asked you about my Daily Streamers. Almost all of them are found on Netflix Instant. I asked how many of you would be OK with titles on Hulu. A lot of you said that would be fine. But I&#8217;ve noticed the Hulu links don&#8217;t get nearly as many hits. And when I link something from Fandor, I&#8217;m disappointed by the response&#8211;even though watching on Fandor is free with their introductory sub, which is not binding. For me, the fact that Fandor shares its revenues with the indie filmmakers is rather noble. But I&#8217;m getting the idea that the great majority of you are on Netflix, period. That&#8217;s fine with me. I love it. I&#8217;m also on Fandor and Hulu. I like Fandor&#8217;s bonus materials. So give me some feedback.</p><footer><strong>-Roger Ebert</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.facebook.com/RogerEbert/posts/448410911838580">Facebook</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I never even think about whether or not someone I know has a Netflix account, I just assume that they do. If a film I know is streaming on Netflix Watch Instantly comes up in conversation, I will immediately suggest, “Watch it on Netflix.”</p>

<p>The other services? Not so much.</p>

<p>I had a Hulu Plus account for awhile but I got rid of it, mostly due to what I see as the company’s <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/16/on-hulu-and-respect/">lack of respect</a> for me as a customer.</p>

<p>Fandor, however, is a site I feel guilty for not having an account on. They have a great selection and an excellent blog, <a href="http://www.fandor.com/blog/">Keyframe Daily</a>, but I just haven’t gotten around to it…yet.</p>

<p>Ebert’s link tracking looks about in line with what I’d expect. Just about everyone who regularly uses the Internet (namely Facebook and Twitter, where Ebert shares these links) has a Netflix account. It’s less likely they have a Hulu account and, for now, it’s a safe bet that almost none of them have a Fandor account.</p>

<p>The comments on the post suggest that most people haven’t heard of Fandor. Scratch that, <em>hadn’t</em> heard of it. With any luck, the site will get a boost from Ebert’s 90,000+ fans.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Panic just <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/05/announcing-coda-2-and-introducing-diet-coda/">announced</a> an update to their popular plain text coding app, <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, and introduced an all <a href="http://panic.com/dietcoda/">iPad app</a> to boot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Diet Coda takes everything we’ve learned about web code editing, and shrinks it down into the beauty and simplicity of your iPad. The perfect companion to Coda — literally, since the two can work together — it’s the ultimate way to make quick fixes while you’re traveling light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I covered SXSW this year with nothing but my iPad. To deploy new posts to this site, I used Panic’s excellent SSH app, <a href="http://panic.com/prompt/support.html">Prompt</a>. Diet Coda looks like an excellent addition.</p>

<p>And Coda 2? Just wait ‘til you see what this thing does with CSS. Insane.</p>

<p>Both go on sale Thursday, May 24th.</p>

<p>This tweet really bummed me out.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/RogueAmoeba">RogueAmoeba</a> I will never purchase or use of one of your products for your sponsorship of the non- @<a href="https://twitter.com/5by5">5by5</a> Talk Show w/o @<a href="https://twitter.com/danbenjamin">danbenjamin</a>. Shame.</p>&mdash; Taylor Allen (@Taylor_M_Allen) <a href="https://twitter.com/Taylor_M_Allen/status/203596350363930624" data-datetime="2012-05-18T21:22:07+00:00">May 18, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>I disagree with Gruber often, but I would never hold his opinions against the advertisers that are featured on Daring Fireball. He&rsquo;s not Rush Limbaugh. He didn&rsquo;t say anything inflammatory that has far-reaching effects that will impact my life.</p>

<p>If we take Mule Radio Syndicate at <a href="http://twitter.com/MuleRadio/statuses/203567508660297728">their word</a>, John approached them first. So why try to bleed an advertiser who likely had no knowledge of any such dealings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/">Rogue Amoeba</a> makes some truly excellent software. <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/piezo/">Piezo</a>, the app that sponsored episode 1 of the new <em>Talk Show</em>, is a great, simple recording app that is gorgeous to look at. I&rsquo;d recommend it in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>If listeners are upset with Gruber or Mule, they can vote with their ears, so to speak, and just not tune in. Then the advertisers will leave of their own volition, or not. It&rsquo;s their call.</p>

<p>But boycotting makers of truly wonderful software over this? We can do better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The Wanda Group, a Chinese conglomerate with extensive interests in the entertainment business, has agreed to acquire AMC Entertainment, North America’s second-largest movie theater owner, in a deal that is valued at $2.6 billion, including roughly $2 billion in assumed debt, the companies said Sunday.</p><footer><strong>-Michael Cieply</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/business/global/amc-theater-deal-links-china-to-hollywood.html">The New York Times</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I fail to see how AMC got itself into the position that it needed to be bought out, what with the cost of tickets and popcorn and sugar water these days. This is good news though, and hopefully American moviegoers will see benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the $2.6 billion value assigned to AMC’s debt and equity in the deal, Wanda is expected to invest $500 million for what the companies called “strategic and operating initiatives.”…it might be used to retire debt, acquire new theaters or fix up old ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep an eye on this, though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to its theaters, Wanda produces and distributes films in China. As word of Wanda’s negotiations with AMC became public in recent weeks, some American executives have privately said that Wanda might eventually use newly acquired American theaters to help pry open an export market for Chinese-made films.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d be happy to see more Chinese films, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.">there’s a reason theaters aren’t owned by movie studios.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday, John Gruber introduced a new version of his popular <em>Talk Show</em> podcast on the Mule Radio Syndicate network, effectively ending his partnership with Dan Benjamin and the 5by5 network. No explanation was offered by Gruber or Dan Benjamin, his co-host and 5by5 founder. So <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">I wrote a blog post</a> speculating about the split, and a lot of people read it. A whole lot.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to figure out why so many people are interested in this story.</p>

<p>Here’s Macdrifter, yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve looked over some of the speculation and personal attacks circulating about Gruber’s switch of networks and have one conclusion: There are a number of self-important dickheads with nothing important to do. I think that describes what’s wrong with many people on the Internet. People take their opinion too seriously and like to inflate their own value. How can anyone without personal connections to and personal knowledge of the network switch have any opinion? Further, who gives a shit. [sic] It’s a podcast that isn’t ending, just switching networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Macdrifter has this wrong, but offers a nice way to explore why so many people <em>do</em> give a shit.</p>

<p>There is a lot of irony in the phrase “self-important dickheads with nothing important to do” because, if we’re honest, it aptly describes Gruber’s persona on Daring Fireball, and that’s not a put down at all. Gruber has built an incredible brand by sneaking bits of his big, churlish personality into his writing, and we love him for it. As many fans as he has, he has loads of enemies who complain that he’s just some blogger with nothing important to do.</p>

<p>But we all know better. We all know that he provides a unique perspective on Apple and the tech industry as a whole. And that he serves an important journalistic service by broadcasting the overarching story of the technology industry as it stands right now.</p>

<p>Daring Fireball’s format, short links with opinionated commentary, has proven to be an enduring one and an inspiration for a number of writers, myself included. Macdrifter asserts that “people take their opinion too seriously,” but I don’t see that as a necessarily bad thing. Surely, Daring Fireball would be nothing without Gruber’s own opinions treated with the seriousness they deserve.</p>

<p>The move to Mule Radio Syndicate is more than “just switching networks.” By moving, Gruber left half the show, namely Dan Benjamin, behind. It’s as if David Letterman were suddenly on cable without Paul Schaffer one day, with no explanation.</p>

<p>But that’s a bad analogy because there <em>would</em> be an explanation. It would be printed in every newspaper, it would be scrutinized in every corner of the Internet, maybe even on Daring Fireball. It would be news, and people would demand coverage of it.</p>

<p>This should be no different.</p>

<p>John Gruber and Dan Benjamin are in the media business. The large and loyal audiences both have fostered allow them to continue their work. Unfortunately, the other edge of that sword means that their output is open to public scrutiny. For the large community of listeners and readers, this is news. It’s a juicy, salacious media story.</p>

<p>As it should be.</p>

<p>People do write about podcasts. I link to them when something relevant to this site’s audience pops up. <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/03/more-on-podcasts-changing-of-the-guard/">Macdrifter has done a great job of publicizing</a> how large the community has become and explaining why listeners are lucky for it. The above quote is perhaps the most charged in an excellent post that spells out why Gruber’s move is actually a boon for the industry. So, I would argue, is the backlash against the sudden and unexplained split.</p>

<p>People care about these shows. They listen to them regularly and discuss them among friends the way a bygone generation would talk about Uncle Miltie. Listeners <em>are</em> personally connected to these shows. We welcome these hosts into our lives every week to be entertained and inspired. There is absolutely a relationship between host and listener and it is a very personal, intimate one. Otherwise what’s the point?</p>

<p>People care about this story because they care about these people. I’m not naïve; there’s a layer of schadenfreude to this story too. Mostly I think people are interested because they like listening to these shows. If things had gone down differently, if listeners were at least kept informed of the move and the show’s changing format, maybe there wouldn’t be a story.</p>

<p>But we weren’t. And it is.</p>
