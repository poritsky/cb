  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Soulmen just released the excellent <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses III</a> text editor. I’ve been using it since January and I love it. Forget what you know about previous versions of Ulysses, this is a ground up rewrite; more accurately a rethinking of what a text editor is.</p>

<p>I’m still putting together a review of it, but I’ll say this much: Ulysses III solves most of <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/20/my-text-problem/">my text problem</a>. It’s on sale during launch week for $19.99 (50% off). <a href="http://bit.ly/12dcIz4">Go get it</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quickie workflow for <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred 2</a>. David Ferguson, a nerd who works on Alfred, has been building some excellent extensions for the launcher/so-much-more app. His <a href="http://dferg.us/google-suggest/">Google Suggest workflow</a> caught my eye, only I don&rsquo;t particularly like using Google for my Web searches anymore. Luckily it&rsquo;s easy enough to modify workflows in Alfred 2.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s suggestions are a great feature. I use them all the time in Safari<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> even though I&rsquo;ve set the default search engine for the location bar to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>. I like DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s commitment to privacy and the simplicity of their bang (!) searches. If I <em>want</em> to search on Google, I just type my string and add &ldquo;!g&rdquo; to do so. But they don&rsquo;t offer a suggestion feature. That&rsquo;s where David&rsquo;s workflow (and my modification) comes in. <del>(Download it here.)</del> <em>See update below.</em></p>

<p>I set the shortcut in Alfred to &ldquo;s&rdquo; for &ldquo;search.&rdquo; Launch Alfred,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> type &ldquo;s&rdquo; and then the start of a search string. Google suggestions will come up, selecting any of them and hitting Enter will take me to DuckDuckGo results. Selecting a result and hitting tab will put the cursor after the selected phrase, allowing me to add whatever bang I please, like !imdb or !a for Amazon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy I got an Alfred Power Pack, which unleashes the power of workflows. I&rsquo;m excited to see what else this little app can do.</p>

<p><strong>Updated May 8, 2014:</strong> Changed plugin to support the new (and if you ask me, superior) <a href="https://next.duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Next</a>. More info <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2014/05/08/duckduckgo-next/">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://medium.com/future-tech-future-market/6d22522ebe7f">Levi Mills</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like my friends. I like the same things as many of my friends. Do I want my friends to be the curators of the content I consume? No. A thousand times no.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting take on the latest Facebook redesign. I barely use Facebook anymore because I find little-to-no value in the content posted there with the sole exception being pictures of my nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>Mills’ piece, I think, gets to the core of why I’m not interested in Facebook: I just don’t care about most of the crap my friends link to. They’re still my friends, but I can do better at finding what to consume elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google Reader is <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">shutting down</a> on July 1st. By chance I actually switched to <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a> a few months back, so this doesn’t really effect me as a reader.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The biggest issue doesn’t seem to be the loss of Reader itself, but the recognition that Google’s priorities have shifted.</p>

<p>I imagine most people, especially daily users of Reader, still like to think of Google as the company described by Chris Anderson in his 2009 book, <a href="http://amzn.to/Qc1fXa">Free: The Future of a Radical Price</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Google, almost anything that happens online can be seen as a complement to its main business. Every blog post put up is more information for Google’s Web crawler to index, to help Google give better search results. Every click in Google Maps is more information about consumer behavior, and every email in Gmail is a clue to our human network of connections, all of which Google can use to help invent new products or just sell ads better.</p>

  <p>The interesting thing about the consumption of complementary products is that they tend to rise in tandem. <strong>The more people use the Internet, the better it is for Google’s core business.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not Google in 2013. The Web is a very different place than it was back then. Users used to demand openness across the Web. That’s why we have RSS and XML-RPC and APIs and all the goodies that make it easy to use data from one site on another, or to make it simple to just plain leave one product for another. Anil Dash put it best in a blog post titled “<a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">The Web We Lost</a>.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>But walls have sprouted up. Google can’t access the massive amounts of data people pour into Facebook and Twitter, so they built Google+ as their own social walled garden. Twitter is exerting control over how users experience their product, which shuts out competitors like Instagram (which is owned by Facebook), which can no longer display images inline in tweets. The Web is getting smaller, not bigger, with each company working to become the umbrella under which you experience the Internet. So Google has taken steps to make sure that the Web as users know it exists under their company banner, and Reader doesn’t fit in with that plan anymore.</p>

<p>I was once a Google cheerleader. Like many I believed their goal was to make a better Web for everyone, with the one major tradeoff being that they would sell ads instead of charging users. That may once have been true but the Google of 2013 doesn’t want to build a better Web, it wants to build a better Google. I don’t think that goal is aligned with any of my own.</p>

<p>And now Reader is gone. What’s next? I’d rather not play that guessing game, so I’m making efforts to remove as much of my data as I can tolerate from Google products. Now might be a good time for you to start to do so as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dropbox founders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/2013/03/welcome-mailbox/">on their company blog</a> after acquiring Mailbox today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re all looking forward to making Mailbox even better and getting it into as many people’s hands as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congrats to all parties involved, seems like a great fit.</p>

<p>I don’t really like Mailbox, the app, but I do love Dropbox, the company. I’m interested to see where this goes, though I’m wary.</p>

<p>For one thing, I don’t understand why Mailbox was free to begin with. Other than being bought, what was their monetization plan? And now that Dropbox has them, how do they plan to make it profitable?</p>

<p>The bigger, more fun question, I think, is what sense does it make for Dropbox to own a product that is currently built on top of Gmail? Sure, Mailbox will probably add IMAP support in the future, but for now it’s Gmail only, which means Dropbox isn’t in control of the core product. Unless, of course, they roll out their own email product. Dropbox has the storage and scalability needed to release a killer mail product, something that truly <em>is</em> revolutionary in this space.</p>

<p>Or maybe they just like the app. In any case, thank goodness Google didn’t buy Mailbox.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This has basically been an insane week for movie, tech and media news. I know <em>the candler blog</em> has been quiet of late, but it’s not because I’ve stopped paying attention to things. It feels like every time I sit down to compose a piece something else massive happens that diverts my attention. That and, uh, I just haven’t been setting aside enough time to write.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’d like to play catch up and give you a short update on my goings on at SXSW this year.</p>

<p>This year marks my fourth fest, but my first as a local. As such, I saw way fewer films than I used to. This used to happen back when I lived in New York too: I wouldn’t take off of work for Tribeca and NYFF, so I’d go to as many screenings as I could in the evenings. Now that I live here I had to balance work and SXSW, or at least try. I still saw a nice helping of films though.</p>

<p>By far my favorite new (to these shores) non-headliner film was <em>Good Vibrations</em>, directed by Lisa Barros D’Sa and Glenn Leyburn. It’s a biopic of Terri Hooley, the man who brought Belfast’s punk scene to the rest of the world. Narratively it’s a straghtforward affair, but it nails the feeling of discovering a new and exciting art form. The scene where Terri, played by Richard Dormer, hears local punkers for the first time nearly brought me to tears. It perfectly summed up what it’s like to cross over from ignorance to understanding, from being lost to finding purpose. And the trick is in Dormer’s eyes. It’s truly a performance to behold.</p>

<p>I forewent the opening night <em>The Incredible Burt Wonderstone</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and instead went next door to check out Shane Carruth’s <em>Upstream Color</em>. I still haven’t seen his first feature, <em>Primer</em>, but the Stateside Theater was loaded with fans of the 2004 film. His latest has garnered a lot of support in the indie community, but I found it to be a trial just to get through. Basically Carruth removes anything resembling exposition from the film, a choice that confuses me more than it excites me.</p>

<p>Plus I wasn’t a fan of the way the film looked. <em>Upstream</em> is shot almost entirely with handheld, shallow depth-of-field telephoto lenses, so scenes drift in and out of focus by design. It feels like just another another layer of confusion standing between me and the story. (There’s a reason I’m not mentioning plot here. If anything it’s secondary. Look it up elsewhere.) Strip away the layers of complexity Carruth has baked into the film and I’m not sure what’s left, but the film’s champions would tell me that’s the point, so I guess it’s a matter of taste.</p>

<p>Real quick:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Spring Breakers</em> is insane, but I liked it. Hidden beneath the sex and drugs and guns and shock there seems to be a message about capitalism, consumerism and America, or something. If you think this film is only about a raucous, violent spring break spree, then you’re going to hate it.</li>
  <li>Joseph Gordon Levitt’s <em>Don Jon</em> is about what you’d expect from an actor’s directorial debut, which is to say it’s not very good but the leads get to speak with funny accents.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that’s enough to share about a few films for now. I’ve got a few more expanded thoughts planned for the future.</p>
