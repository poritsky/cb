  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good on David Carr at the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/business/media/reddit-thrives-after-advance-publications-let-it-sink-or-swim.html">for filing a piece on Reddit</a>, which is still an enigma to most followers of old media. His inroad is President Obama’s historic AMA (“Ask Me Anything”) thread from last week. As someone who couldn’t believe a sitting president would go on Jon Stewart, I was blown away he would subject himself to the hive mind of Reddit,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I’m glad he did, if only to put the site on the radars of those who think it’s just for nerds.</p>

<p>Here’s my favorite bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reddit is not an exception to every rule in the digital world. Like many digital media companies, it has a big audience and minuscule revenue. Bob Sauerberg, president of Condé Nast and a member of the board of the independent company, says that is fine by him.</p>

  <p>“We think it has huge potential and we want to make sure that we scale that,” he said. “There will be ample opportunity to monetize what they have built as it grows, and it will be a very big business.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit’s users won’t allow it to be monetized in any traditional way (see: Digg), so as a company they’ll have to be spry and forward-thinking. Sauerberg’s untraditional sentiment seems predicated on two ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t mess with a product that works.</li>
  <li>If you can’t find a way to make money with a community that large, get the hell out of Dodge.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is very welcome thinking from an old media stalwart like Condé Nast. Let’s see where the site is two years down the line.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

      <p>Hell, I can’t believe he exposed himself to the obvious criticism of his typos.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks once again to the New York Film Academy for sponsoring this past week of the candler blog.</em></p>

<p>For the aspiring actor, getting a break in an acclaimed film may seem like the career breakthrough moment. But for many it comes before that: In the training, the exposure to new and established film acting talent, and acquiring key tools: students gain experience with film equipment, work on live film shoots and create their all-important actor’s reel.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/" rel="nofollow">New York Film Academy</a>, with campuses in New York, Boston (Harvard University campus), Los Angeles (Universal Studios) and Orlando (Disney Studios) – as well as locations abroad in Europe, Asia and Australia – offers those pre-stardom experiences that have launched the careers of many new stars of TV and film: Aubrey Plaza (“Parks &amp; Recreation”), Camilla Ludington (“William &amp; Kate”), Eve Hewson (“This Must Be the Place”), Chord Overstreet (“Glee”) and Analeigh Tipton (“Crazy Stupid Love”).</p>

<p>Additionally, NYFA campuses draw an exceptionally broad mix of students from all over the world. It becomes a reference point for global careers.</p>

    </p>
  </header>




  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I started syndicating all of the posts from the candler blog to a new Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/thecandlerblog">@thecandlerblog</a>. Since I’m off Wordpress and thus can’t use a fancy-pants plugin to achieve this, I decided to use an <a href="https://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> recipe to take my site’s RSS feed and send out a tweet on the new account. Easy!</p>

<p>Not so fast. I ran into a bit of a problem that I figured was edge case-y enough that I didn’t need to bother you all with the nerdy details of how I fixed it. But Doug Stephen just <a href="http://canadian-fury.com/2012/08/31/an-absolutely-ridiculous-hack-to-syndicate-octopress-to-twitter-via-ifttt-with-support-for-linklog-posts/">posted his own hack</a> to solve the exact same issue, so I figure it’s time for me to share the sauce (really, it’s very boring sauce) on how I got it up and running.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of posts on the candler blog: Normal, long-ish blog posts like the one you’re reading right now, and link posts,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which are shorter and feature a headline that links out to a different site. I love writing link posts, and I encourage readers to go check out the sites I’m linking to. I’m only too happy to have readers subscribe to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/thecandlerblog">my RSS feed</a> and experience the site through a feed reader.</p>

<p>However, this setup doesn’t quite work on Twitter. All I want posted to the site’s official feed is the post title and the URL back to the candler blog. Why? Because I believe the full experience of what I’m trying to do here comes from the headline I choose, the sites I link to and the commentary I write.</p>

<p>The IFTTT RSS to Twitter recipe can only syndicate the post’s title and the URL it points to. In the case of link posts, all you will see is a headline and a link to some other site. That would be all well and good except it basically diminishes the whole experience of reading the candler blog. There will be no context for the link. Or the headline. So that wouldn’t do.</p>

<h3 id="the-fix">The Fix</h3>

<p>Enter <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>. If you’ve never played with Pipes before, I highly recommend taking it for a spin. I barely know the full potential of the tool, but I do know this: it allows you to take any RSS feed, even multiple feeds, and rewire them to your liking. Want to mash some feeds together? What to get a new feed featuring only the work of a single author? How about only tagged with things you are interested in? It’ll do all of that and more. And it allows me to reconfigure my site’s feed to change the destination of link post URLs back to the candler blog. Here’s a quick look at what my pipe looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/pipe.jpg" title="My Link Fixing Pipe" /></p>

<p>The first little window you see is simply there to fetch my site’s RSS feed. All that needs doing there is to plug in the Feedburner URL of my feed. Easy.</p>

<p>The next window is where all of the magic happens. The Create RSS module (under “Operators” in pipes) allows you to do the rerouting of feed level items. In short, it gives you a blank slate of an RSS feed, and then allows you to plug in whatever data from your feed you want. In my case, every part of the feed should remain the same except for the Link section. Items like title and description are all available from a drop down in the RSS creator module. All I needed to find was which operator to plug into the link level to tell pipes to use each post’s permalink as its title link.</p>

<p>Following?</p>

<p>Along the bottom of the pipes interface is a handy little tool that displays whatever your feed looks like on the selected module. To find the permalink in the feed, I selected the Fetch Feed module (the one at the top) and started digging through the feed output? Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/pipe-display.jpg" title="Pipe Output Display" /></p>

<p>The permalink pointing to my site is, luckily, easy enough to find under <code>guid &gt; content</code>. Simply type <code>item.guid.content</code> into the Create RSS line for Link and connect it to the pipe output. Now, instead of the external link, the RSS headline will be point to the original candler blog post.</p>

<p>Save the pipe, then from the “My Pipes” page, grab the new RSS feed. Go back to IFTTT and create a recipe using the pipe RSS feed. Boom. A convoluted workaround to account for link posts.</p>

<h3 id="almost-done">Almost Done</h3>

<p>All this automation is well and good, but sometimes I like to push it along. For that, I have a few handy bookmarks in a folder that I click after posting.</p>

<p>First off is pinging my feed. Feedburner is <em>supposed</em> to ping your site every 30 minutes, but, you know, Feedburner sucks. Luckily, they have a <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/ping">manual pinging page</a> where you can enter your feed and ping away. The URL of the page that returns when you do this is actually all you need to set off a manual ping, so after you do it manually, just drag the page to your bookmarks bar and save it. The URL should look like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/pingSubmit?bloglink=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2F[your-feed-name-here]
</span><span class="line">// Sans brackets, of course. //</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Next, I like to check on my pipe and make sure it refreshed. To do that, I simply saved the direct URL to my pipe as a bookmark. After I ping Feedburner, I go and check that the pipe received the update. If it hasn’t, no worries, it picks it up quickly enough.</p>

<p>Finally, I keep a bookmark handy that points directly to the IFTTT page for the Twitter posting recipe. I tried saving IFTTT’s built in <code>force-run</code> URL scheme, but I have been unable to actuate it from the Bookmarks Bar. Visiting it simply takes me back to my recipe page. If I really want a tweet to go out right away, I go to the IFTTT page for the recipe and click “Check Now.” I’ve stopped doing this unless I plan to post more than one post in the space of 15 minutes, IFTTT’s automated (and quite reliable) refresh time.</p>

<h3 id="go-forth-and-post">Go Forth and Post</h3>

<p>If I had to guess, I’d say it took me about 15 times as long to write this blog post as it did to set up this Pipe and IFTTT recipe. Both tools work incredibly well together. Pipes is powerful for taking any number of RSS feeds and turning them into the content that you want, and IFTTT allows you to do all kinds of wacky stuff with an RSS feed. And now that I’ve set it up I rarely think about it, so I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>This system works well for me on Octopress, but I assume that it works similarly for any static blogging system. Your mileage may vary, but I’d love to hear what blogging engines this works on and which ones it breaks. And if you have ideas on how to finesse this, please do share.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>New Yorkers are getting a little Bond treat this month <a href="http://ebm.enews-moma.org/c/tag/BQP2XwB73jgnB8tvF7Nsf-GkUy/doc.html">at the Museum of Modern Art</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coinciding with Global James Bond Day on October 5, the exhibition kicks off that evening at 8:00 p.m. with the screening of <em>Dr. No</em> introducing Sean Connery as the original Bond, and will screen the Bond films in chronological order twice during the month of October.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>October 5th is the exact 50th anniversary of <em>Dr. No’s</em> premiere.</p>

<p>Bonus, from the <a href="http://press.moma.org/wp-content/files_mf/momafilm_50yearsofjamesbond2012_pressrelease_final77.pdf">press release (PDF)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accompanying <em>50 Years of James Bond</em> is <em>Goldfinger: the Design of an Iconic Film Title</em>, an installation that features the first film title sequence to enter MoMA’s collection as a design work in its own right, in conjunction with related preparatory material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The films, I assume, will screen here in Austin at some point, but I’m curious about that installation. Probably worth a peek if you’re in NYC this fall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over at The New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/garden/the-classics-circa-2050.html?pagewanted=all">Julie Lasky ponders</a> which items will be considered classic icons of design in the future:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a better perspective, I asked a dozen contemporary furniture experts for their opinions on which objects produced in the last decade or so would occupy the design-conscious home of 2050, just as, say, the Eames lounge chair, a mid-20th-century creation, resides in ours. […]</p>

  <p>Half the designers, scholars and connoisseurs I polled, in fact, selected an Apple product as an example, if not their sole choice, of canonical early 21st-century design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seems to be some disagreement over whether the original iPod or iPhone is more iconic. Personally I’d vote for the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod_4thgen.html">4th generation iPod</a>.</p>

  <p>Another greatest hit from Apple troll bag: Apple is a technology poser that merely dresses up in pretty “marketing” the engineering innovations of other “real” technology companies.</p>

Then, a decade ago, it was because the iPod boom would surely prove fleeting and soon go bust. Now, it’s because they’re too big, doomed by their success and the company’s institutional hubris.</p>

<p>Final Draft just released Final Draft Writer, a full-fledged screenwriting word processor for the iPad. Michael Grothaus writes <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/08/28/final-draft-writer-comes-to-the-ipad/">for TUAW</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Final Draft Writer isn’t going to replace Final Draft for OS X, just like no word processor for iOS will ever replace desktop word processors for professional writers that deal with manuscripts that are hundreds of pages long. But what Final Draft Writer does do is give screenwriters the ability to work on their scripts any time and any where that they are away from their computers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure if I had the gumption I could reach my hand into the Internet and pull up a few “professional writers that deal with manuscripts that are hundreds of pages long” who have moved to an all (or mostly) iOS workflow, but I’ll spare you.</p>

<p>Final Draft Writer is on sale for $29.99 until September 30th, so you should probably <a href="http://bit.ly/O1bkEQ">go get it</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> before then.</p>

<p>I’m surprised by the price. Even at $49.99, seems low by Final Draft’s standards which worries me. Do they view this only as a “mobile” solution, not a burgeoning computing market? In other words, is the “it isn’t going to replace Final Draft for OS X” just Grothaus shooting from the hip, or is it the way Final Draft wants public perception of the app? I write on my iPad all the time, I don’t even think about it as a stop-gap anymore; it’s just another computer. Apps that fall short of accepting that credo tend to be ones that have little value for me.</p>

<p>That said, Final Draft Writer looks like it has potential to be a great collaboration and annotation tool for the industry standard FDX format. Like most things Final Draft, I’ll bet it becomes a great producers tool, with popularity among writers coming second. I haven’t downloaded it yet and I doubt I will. If I need to do any screenwriting on the go I use <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a>, which has a growing <a href="http://fountain.io/apps">list of supported apps</a> last time I checked.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nice deduction <a href="http://arthousecowboy.com/journal/2012/8/28/criterion-finally-releasing-qatsi-trilogy.html">from Moisés Chiullan</a> over at Arthouse Cowboy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today’s Criterion newsletter “wacky drawing” contains three “caught C’s”. It’s been rumored for some time that they would release Godfrey Reggio’s three “Qatsi” movies (Koyaanisqatsi, Powwaqqatsi, and Naqoyqatsi), which have no conventional plot, and instead feature gorgeous photography centered around broad themes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unconfirmed, of course, but sounds solid to me.</p>
