  <p>In the early days of the iPad, one of the first apps I bought was
<a href="http://www.cocoabox.com/penultimate">Penultimate</a> by <a href="http://www.cocoabox.com/">Cocoa Box
Design</a>. Penultimate was designed to be your digital
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883705386">Moleskine</a> notebook, a simple
and elegant blank page on which to doodle, sketch, or write. Whether it was
the elegance of the app or the fluidity of the pseudo-pressure-sensitive
drawing, Penultimate earned a permanent place on the front screen of my iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I approached the developer, Ben Zotto, about my desire to use Penultimate
for storyboarding. The app then offered a selection of three paper styles;
plain, lined, and graph. Rather than myopically suggesting he add
storyboarding templates, a rather niche use case, I suggested that it might be
of general interest to his users to allow custom papers. I must not have been
the only one thinking this, because just this May, Ben <a href="http://blog.cocoabox.com/post/5141379602/papers-papers-papers">released Penultimate
3.0</a> with
exactly that feature. He even used a film storyboard as his example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This link is a whopping two days old, but it’s worth the read if you haven’t
seen it yet. Stu’s attention to detail and his custom Penulimate storyboard
sheets are simply phenomenal. If you have an iPad it’s a must read. If you’re
a filmmaker wavering on getting one, be careful; you’ll want one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wall Street analysts warned cable operators on Tuesday that they’d better
fix their clunky user interfaces and lousy consumer service if they want to
avoid a showdown with Internet and technology powers such as Google and Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wall Street analysts tend to make shit up, especially when it comes to
<a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/04/20/apples-blow-out-quarter-the-
bloggers-called-it-the-street-blew-it/">Apple</a>. Still, cable companies have had their
head in the sand for too long, so if it takes being scared silly by analysts,
so be it.Times have changed but my Time Warner Cable menus haven’t. I mean
since I clicked the exit button ten minutes ago… Here’s my other favorite
excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Citigroup Investment Research’s Jason Bazinet] raised one possibility that
has grabbed many people’s imaginations recently – that Apple might design a
TV set that would work with programming from a pay TV rival such as DirecTV.
“That plays to Apple’s strength, which is not your strength, which is the
operating system,” Bazinet said, calling cable’s user experience “a Rube
Goldberg contraption.”</p>

<p>Amazing someone has to warn them about what seems so obvious.</p>

<p>Fascinating piece from Dr. Drang about where Apple is taking the file system.
In short, iCloud represents a move to keep documents within specific

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think in order to talk about J.J. Abrams’ <em>Super 8</em>, one must first talk
about “The Case,” the super 8mm movie directed by the titular young
protagonists that plays over the end credits of the film. It is a low-budget
zombie flick made by the rubenesque Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) and
starring all of his boyfriends plus one femme fatale. A detective must figure
out why people are turning into zombies before they kill his wife.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> In
short it’s a bunch of dudes making movies<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> because they can and they want
to: best summer ever. This creative process seems to be what motivated Abrams
when he set out to make a monster movie that could both stake a spot in the
genre’s canon and pay homage to it’s wondrous and oftentimes idiotic past. He
wants to give kids an old fashioned thrill, and he does so effectively in this
derivative yet enjoyable film.</p>

<p>zombie sub-genre that would find popularity later on. Ahead of his time.</p>

<p>but I would guess he had something to do with this being a story about dudes
making movies.</p>

<p>Even if he weren’t a producer, Steven Spielberg’s hand can be readily felt in
almost every frame of <em>Super 8</em>, and not only only from his early forays into
monster mayhem like <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> or <em>E.T.: The Extra
Terrestrial</em>. Abrams’ use (perhaps overuse) of lens flare feels quite a bit
like <em>War of the Worlds</em> and there is even a shot that feels lifted straight
out of <em>Munich</em>. This is not just a film for the plugged in fanboy (there’s an
insider <em>Star Wars</em> quip that got a healthy laugh in my theater) but an out
and out attempt to match directorial wits with Spielberg. Abrams is trying to
replicate the spirit of a young Spielberg film with the benefit of knowing the
director’s latter creative forks. It’s nostalgia of nostalgia.</p>

<p>But what of the story? The fun of Abrams’ concept and subsequent marketing is
that audience members are left mostly in the dark about what the film is
actually <em>about</em>. I can tell you there’s a monster and that it is rightly
obscured for the first two thirds of the film. M. Night Shyamalan, the one-
time “next Spielberg,” misfired in <em>Signs</em> by showing his (utterly lame)
monster too early. Restraint is only half the battle; the creature design here
is top notch. It’s a mostly original [redacted] geared to inspire wonder in
young minds. It’s all about the monster in <em>Super 8</em>.</p>

<p>That being said, much of the rest of the film feels too corny for a modern
audience[^3]. Most of the plot revolves around “vintage Spielberg”
conventions. Broken family in peril, misunderstood nerd, daddy issues, fear of
government, etc. Abrams put together a well-oiled and nicely sapped machine
here, but it’s important to remember that he is paying homage to bad movies.
The monster movies that boys watch at sleepovers have plots that are full of
holes and superfluous characters, faux emotional progressions and misplaced
messages. At one point a boy even yells “Drugs are so bad!” as a stoned adult
sleeps his way through a veritable war zone. It helps to have a PSA in your
monster movie so moms will feel okay making popcorn for the whole block.</p>

<p><em>Super 8</em> seems like a film from another era, which is especially fascinating given Spielberg’s history of hands-on producing. In the 1980s he earned a reputation as a backseat director for his protegé’s projects. He <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_(film)#Production">famously wrested most of <em>Poltergeist</em></a> away from Tobe Hooper. He also took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goonies#Production">some if not all of the reins</a> from Richard Donner on <em>The Goonies</em>, a film that seems to share a heartbeat with <em>Super 8</em>. In both of those cases, however, Spielberg took a “Story by” but not this time around. When we fade to black, the first credit that comes up is “Written and Directed by J.J. Abrams.” If the elder director did in fact keep his hands out of the honey pot this outing, then what does it say of Abrams who seems to have made a film that feels as closely watched over as those earlier works?<br />
[^3]:Perhaps that’s a relative stance. People in my theater got a kick out of
the trailer for the Kevin James starring <em>Zoo Keeper</em>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed I’ve spun an entire review without mentioning the plot or
most of the characters. Not only would it be tough to skirt around spoilers,
the truth is I think you’ll find a bevy of options online to whet your
palette, but in all honesty I say just go to the theater and experience it for
yourself. <em>Super 8</em> makes for a fun summer ride that’s worth the price of
popcorn. If you need more than that, look elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>Back in 1994, after we published a series of articles on no-budget movies
like El Mariachi and Clerks, we felt morally compelled to publish a more sober
follow-up, <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=lt9xkwbab&et;=1105864868977&s;=41244&amp;e

850NeClUu5g5Ps3s8jBM=">The Myth of the Seven Thousand Dollar
Movie</a>. It was written by producers Mary Jane Skalski (Win
Win) and Anthony Bregman (Our Idiot Brother), who back then were members of
the New York production company Good Machine. They wrote: “If you’re like most
low-budget filmmakers, the word deliverables probably ranks somewhere at the
very bottom of your List of Major Concerns, below ‘Outline my next film’ and
above ‘Pay back Uncle Mort’s $1,000 loan.’ &gt; … &gt; So, it’s almost 20 years
later, and what did I spend yesterday talking about at the IFP Narrative Lab?
Deliverables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I think Scott Macaulay is missing here is that creative people don’t want
to do heavy lifting. The tools have gotten slicker, the industry has gotten
smarter, but filmmakers still don’t know how to deliver a film. I don’t think
they ever will, and that’s a good thing. Let them keep the creative juices
swirling, leave the boring transcodes and captures to the rest of us.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Great point <a href="https://twitter.com/filmmakermag/status/78922658938499073">from Scott via Twitter</a> I didn’t consider before opening my mouth:<br />
&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/FilmmakerMag">@FilmmakerMag</a>:
<a href="https://twitter.com/poritsky">@poritsky</a> I’m using the term “filmmakers”
broadly. #ifplab includes producers too.</p>

<p>The problem may then be producers not realizing there is more heavy lifting
involved in their job description than they imagined.</p>

out there in 2009 and it became the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/17/full-deadcenter-coverage/">first film festival I ever

never forget your first time…</p>

<p>I haven’t been back since, but it’s a great fest that looks to have a pretty
sharp lineup this year. They’ve got a great team I was happy to finally catch

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I linked to in my <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/08/leaked-
import-preferences-from-fcp-x/">last post</a>, a Twitter user today leaked a number of
screenshots from the forthcoming Final Cut Pro X and the as yet unannounced
Motion 5. The photos have been removed from TwitPic and the Twitter account
that shared them has now been taken offline. Luckily, blogs like <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/06/08/images_claim_to_show_apples_mo
tion_5_final_cut_pro_x.html">Appleinsider
</a> and
<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/08/leaked-screenshots-from-final-
cut-pro-x-and-motion-5/">Macrumors</a> Odds are these are legit. Apple previewed FCP X back
in April, and the one screenshot that comes from it looks pretty inline with
what they teased at NAB.</p>

<p>Apple promised to ship FCP X for $299 in the Mac App Store sometime in June.
These screenshots are the first we are seeing of Motion 5. Let’s poke around
the images and see what we see.</p>

<h2 id="fcp-x-import">FCP X Import</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/06/fcp_x_import_preferences.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/06/fcp_x_import_preferences-
1024x552.jpg" alt="FCP X Import Preferences Leaked Screenshot" /></a> Let’s start off with
Final Cut Pro’s video import settings panel. Here’s a transcript of what it
says in there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organizing * Copy files to Final Cut Events folder * Import folders as Keyword Collections * Transcoding * Create optimized media * Create proxy media * Video * Analyze for stabilization and rolling shutter * Analyze for balance color * Find people * Consolidate find people results * Create Smart Collections after analysis * Audio * Analyze and fix audio problems * Separate mono and group stereo audio * Remove silent channels<br />
### Organizing and Transcoding ###</li>
</ul>

<p>If these really are all of the settings editors are allotted for importing
tapeless format, there are going to be a lot of confused customers. My main
confusion is under the “Transcoding” menu. We’ve grown so accustomed to the
growing number of ProRes formats, are we now to understand that we are given
merely two options, “optimized” or “proxy” media?</p>

<p>Moreover, what <em>is</em> a transcode anyway? The first check box implies that FCP X
will simply move your tapeless media into the “Final Cut Events folder”.
What’s most interesting, for better or worse, is that that is even an option
at all. Will this folder operate somewhat like the iTunes Music folder, where
it keeps media consolidated if you like it to? Or will you be allowed to roll
your own file system structuring. Since FCP X is supposed to leverage every
processor in your machine to allow you to cut raw media, what are those
transcodes for? How come you can have <em>both</em> “options” and “proxy” media. I’m
not too worried about these options being set out the way they are, but I can
say, if this is real, they raise a lot of questions about what an FCP X
workflow actually looks like.</p>

<h3 id="video">Video</h3>

<p>Most of the video settings we see here are exactly what was teased at NAB, and
they are a very good sign. All of the seemingly superfluous, automated doodads
(which may actually turn out to be life savers) that Apple is pushing hard can
be turned off. Many editors, after the original demo, were worried that FCP X
was going to start automating the entire cutting process, coloring video you’d
rather leave raw or getting rid of rolling shutter even if you want to keep
it. This screengrab implies that those processes won’t happen on ingest.
Instead, FCP X has the ability to “analyze” the media so that you can flip a
switch later to implement any quick changes.</p>

<p>Analyzing your footage for rolling shutter, making it easier to correct later,
can be a great feature, but it can also be a huge strain on your processor.
Though Apple says it will happen in the background, it’s likely that many of
these processes will slow down your cutting while the media is ingesting. So
it’s a very good thing you can turn off color and “people” analysis;
especially “people” analysis. I turned on face detection for four years worth
of photos when I first got Aperture 3. Not only did it take the better part of
a day to complete the process, but it ground Aperture to a halt while it
chewed through the photos. Thank goodness this is optional.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>I’m actually most excited for the check boxes listed here. The only one that
is scary is “Analyze and fix audio problems”. That’s like saying to the
computer to “make me dinner”; even if it pops out something edible, it
probably won’t be what you wanted. This kind of vague automation will prove
itself either useful or useless over time. Perhaps there’s another dialog in
which we can pick what fixes we would like to apply.</p>

<p>Still, that “Separate mono and group stereo” looks pretty great. I wish there
were a way to automate this into tape-based workflows. I’ve seen a lot of
mistakes made because people just don’t know how the tracks were recorded. Let
the computer sort that out. And that “Remove silent channels”? Bye bye 16
extra channels of DVCProHD.</p>

<h2 id="motion">Motion</h2>

<p>I realize I’ve already been long-winded about a single <em>supposed</em> Final Cut
Pro screenshot. The good news is I have way fewer opinions about a new rev of
Motion. Let’s start with the best one:</p>

<h3 id="project-browser">Project Browser</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_project_browser.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-conten
t/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_project_browser.jpg" alt="Leaked Motion 5 Project Browser Image" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the options users are presented when creating new Motion projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Motion Project * Final Cut Effect * Final Cut Generator * Final Cut Transition * Final Cut Title<br />
Now this could get fun. It’s starting to look like there is some deep
integration between Final Cut Pro and Motion. Anything effect generated in
Final Cut can now be created by you and your team. The sky could be the limit,
but it’s unclear how this would work exactly. For example, a “Final Cut
Effect” would presumably be a color or stylized type of overlay for video
clips. Do you have to create these for a single frame size and frame rate?
Will HD effects work on SD footage and vice versa? The same goes for
transitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this screenshot and it implications turn out to be true, then perhaps
Motion really has swallowed up Color. A Final Cut Effect could potentially act
as a sort of color grade or LUT that could be dropped on whole scenes. Or it
could be something we haven’t even thought of. Speaking of Color.</p>

<h3 id="wheres-color">Where’s Color?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_rgb_waveform.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/06/motion_5_rgb_waveform.jpg" alt="Leaked Motion 5 Waveform Screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>This image is also supposedly from the new Motion. This would seem to be
pretty good proof that Color is now a feature within Motion 5. While there is
certainly need for a complex Waveform monitor in a motion graphics
application, this looks fairly complex, as does the waveform of whatever image
was loaded into the app when this was taken. Even if this waveform monitor is
only in Motion, it would seem to make the functionality of the two apps
redundant. Why not split them? Better, why not put Color right into Final Cut?</p>

<p>I love Color in its current form. not only is it incredibly powerful, but it
also promotes discipline among cutters. I know it’s not the best argument for
it, but by keeping Color and Soundtrack Pro as separate apps, cutters have
been forced to follow a traditional editorial model and actually lock picture
for good. Non-destructive editing systems have made tweaking so easy that an
edit could never end. Technically, you could always send a project to Color,
so some work, then bring it back, cut some more, then send it back out, but it
was a pain in the ass. It would have been the same pain in the ass to go to a
supervised color correct in telecine more than once. So we had to learn
discipline.</p>

<p>If Color has now been integrated into another app, that will make it even more
efficient and allow for quicker turnarounds. Maybe it’s just me who will be
tempted to tweak color, then tweak the edit, then tweak the color again… In
fact, that doesn’t sound too bad. I hope we get to see the real thing soon so
I can stop with this wild speculation.</p>

Screenshot" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Macrumors did a great job digging this up. The Twitter user who leaked
screenshots of the forthcoming FCP X and Motion 5 is no longer active, for
some reason…</p>

<p>Nothing much revealed that we didn’t already know was coming to FCP X in the
above import preferences dialog. Definitely some nice touches there though.
The ability to either separate mono or group stereo audio automatically will
cause much less confusion.</p>

<p>The transcoding options also look very interesting. What’s the difference
between optimized and proxy media? Can’t wait to find out.</p>
