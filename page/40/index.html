  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, the lede on this one is that <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> will open on IMAX screens for one week, but really <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-to-receive-imax-re-release/?pagewanted=all">this whole interview with Steven Spielberg is excellent</a>. Dave Itzkoff at the New York Times extracted some excellent answers from the director. Here’s just one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q.: When you made “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” you were taking your inspiration from many filmmakers of decades past. Now that a few decades have elapsed since then, do you see yourself having a similar influence on directors today?</p>

  <p>A.: I have a lot of contact with a lot of young filmmakers. I run a studio with Stacy Snider, and we meet so many first-time filmmakers, or filmmakers that haven’t even made their first film yet, so all these generations are constantly mixing together. It’s not like one generation replaces another. It’s one generation continuing to inspire another. I’m inspired by so many of the movies I’m looking at today that are made by first-time filmmakers. If I see any good movie, it makes whatever I’m doing currently a better movie. Just for its very existence, it will make my work better, if I’m inspired by somebody. I don’t look at this as a trickle-down effect. I look at this, sometimes, as how the creative community shares their art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a wonderful sentiment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every once in awhile I remember this or that tech capability, the kind of thing that probably isn’t enough to make a whole blog post about and might make you go, “Yeah, dweeb, everyone knows that.” Or, maybe it’s something you never knew about and will be forever grateful to the guy or gal who opened your eyes to it. Anyway, let me get on with this first “Untimely Tip,” a collection of minutiae that seems useful to me and might be to you.</p>

<h3 id="the-narrative">The Narrative</h3>

<p>I just <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/07/06/goodbye-new-york/">moved to Austin</a> from New York City. We<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> sent almost everything we own with a long distance moving company. Naturally, our furniture, clothes and techy things are all still en route while we’ve been here for a week. Which means we’re camping in the apartment in the meantime.</p>

<p>Because they contain my livelihood, I didn’t feel comfortable sending my iMac and my hard drives with the movers.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Instead I packed it in the car, and I’m more than glad I did. During the days (<em>days!</em>) we spent waiting for Time Warner to come install Internet service, my trusty 21.5” iMac served as a DVD/TV All-in-One. I plugged it in, headed out to <a href="http://www.vulcanvideo.com">Vulcan Video</a> and rented a handful of <em>Breaking Bad</em> discs. Perfect.</p>

<p>Between the two of us we have six Wi-Fi capable devices: two iPads,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> two iPhones,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> my iMac and her HP laptop. Earlier this year, I bought an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ALA2RC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008ALA2RC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thecandlerblo-20">Airport Express</a> based on <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/06/wifi-routers/">Ben Brooks’s suggestion</a> and I couldn’t be happier with it. That tiny white hockey puck fixed all of my networking issues. Naturally, lacking foresight, I packed the little sucker onto the truck that is currently meandering around the country somewhere.</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>Eager to get online, I was a bit annoyed to find that I’d only be able to hardwire the our cable modem into my iMac and not use it on our iPads and iPhones. Being that, until I bought <a href="http://instagram.com/p/OXHxbWLdBS/">a desk</a> last night, the only furniture we had in the place was an air mattress and a lawn chair, the Internet would only be useful on our iPads. Plus, 3G service is spotty in the new place, so our phones could’ve used a little Wi-Fi juice as well.</p>

<p>And that’s when I remembered: I can just turn my iMac into a Wi-Fi base station. I did it once years ago on a music video shoot. Before we left New York, I upgraded to Mountain Lion, and I wasn’t positive that this nice little feature made the cut into the latest version of the OS, but lucky for me it did.</p>

<h3 id="the-tip">The Tip</h3>

<p>Okay, here’s how to do it.</p>

<p>First, get your iMac connected to the Internet over ethernet. Once that’s working all you have to do is open up System Preferences and go to the “Sharing” pane. Down the left-hand side, select (but don’t check) “Internet Sharing.” Here’s what you should see:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/wifi-sharing-1.jpg" title="Internet Sharing Pane" /></p>

<p>“Share your connection from:” should be set to ethernet and “To computers using:” should only have “Wi-Fi” checked off. Click the button on the lower right that says “Wi-Fi Options.” The following pane will slide down:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/wifi-sharing-2.jpg" title="Wi-Fi Options Pane" /></p>

<p>From there, just give your network a name and a password. “Security” might not automatically be set to “WPA2 Personal,” but you should be able to select it from the drop-down menu. Hit OK then check the “On” checkbox next to Internet Sharing (see the last screenshot). If you have your Wi-Fi status icon visible in the menubar, it should now look like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/wifi-sharing-3.jpg" title="Internet Sharing Pane" /></p>

<p>Ta da. Now you can connect your iPads and laptops to the network you just created and surf the web. Any Mac with an Ethernet port can do this little trick.</p>

<p>This has been useful for me twice in the ten years I’ve been using Macs. But hey, in both cases it came in incredibly handy, so I’m glad Apple keeps building it into OS X.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Netflix announced a new feature called “post-play” <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2012/08/new-post-play-experience-makes-it-easy.html">on its official blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you finish watching an episode of a TV show, we’ll minimize the credits and tee-up the next episode. If you do nothing, the next episode will start to play in 15 seconds. You can also stop it to get more information or select another episode.</p>

  <p>When you finish watching a movie, we’ll minimize the credits and offer you three recommendations to try next. If those don’t suit you, you can always go directly to search from post-play or go back to browsing to find something else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Available now in a web browser and on PS3, coming soon to other platforms.</p>

<p>Sounds like a great feature. I hope soon they’ll allow you to build and share playlists. Imagine finishing a film and having suggestions laid out by a friend of yours (or a critic you like) instead of selected by an algorithm. Could be cool.</p>

<p>The name is stupid, though. “Keep watching” might make more sense. Or “Sedentary Sunday.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/08/happy-10th-birthday-daring-fireball/261061/">others</a> <a href="http://kottke.org/12/08/an-appreciation-of-10-years-of-daring-fireball">have</a> <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/13/happy-10th-anniversary-daring-fireball/">pointed</a> <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2012/08/happy-10th-df/">out</a>, today marks the tenth anniversary of John Gruber’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>. Happy Birthday DF, and congratulations to John. Helluva milestone.</p>

<p>I gained a lot of readers here for my coverage of <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">John’s schism with 5by5</a>, but I hope those of you who have been around since don’t have the impression that I have any ill will toward Gruber. Daring Fireball remains a source of inspiration to me as a writer, a reader and a publisher.</p>

<p>Back in January, when I redesigned and refocused the candler blog, I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/13/the-story-i-want-to-tell/">quoted John as a means of explaining</a> what I’d like this site to be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I’m never trying to paint a picture of this week in tech, I’m trying to paint the big picture; like a years long tapestry. I have to do it, though, one day at a time based on what’s going on right now.</p>

    <p>Maybe parts of the narrative change. Maybe, I’m wrong. You have to look at the story that’s being told over the course of a year.</p>

    <footer><strong>-John Gruber</strong> <cite><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/49">Back to Work #49: The Field of Completion (Approx. 46:30)</a></cite></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I read Daring Fireball every day. This is perhaps the best distillation of what it is that makes Gruber’s site so honest, enjoyable and engaging. The idea of painting a big picture, a “years long tapestry,” is actually why I keep reading <em>most</em> of the sites that I love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still read it every single day. Like many other writers, too numerous to count, I owe a lot to John for pioneering this form and style of writing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I would never have even considered running a site with link posts if it weren’t for Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>Can’t wait to see what the next decade holds for DF.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Yes, pioneered. I really don’t care if linkblogging existed before DF, the guy’s a damn frontiersman as far as I’m concerned.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jonathan Landreth at Foreign Policy <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/13/twitter_is_my_city">interviewed Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei</a>. I like this bit about New York:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Little Italy, you can still see the old buildings and the streets where they shot <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Mean Streets</em>. That’s a town where you can still relate to other people, your father’s or your grandfather’s joy or sadness. You can sense it. Normally we call it humanity. Where is the humanity in Beijing? Who can remember the corner where he went to school, or can touch a particular old piece of wall? Can you remember anything here? There’s nothing left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What he calls humanity many would call nostalgia. This seems to be such an excellent case for sentimentality. Perhaps it’s what makes us human.</p>

<p>He goes on to talk about Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is my city, my favorite city. I can talk to anybody I want to. And anybody who wants to talk to me will get my response. They know me better than their relatives or my relatives. There’s so much imagination there; a lot of times it’s just like poetry. You just read one sentence, and you sense this kind of breeze or a kind of look. It’s amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know how many times I’ve tried to explain to family and friends that Twitter is a place where I like to spend time. They look at me like I have three heads and then go check their Facebook statuses, the irony lost on them.</p>

<p>Ai, who owes much of his international prominence to the social network, put it better than anyone: Twitter is a city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>YouTube lifts its skirt a bit on how a video gets to be considered popular <a href="http://youtubecreator.blogspot.com/2012/08/youtube-now-why-we-focus-on-watch-time.html">over on its Creator Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best thing creators can do to be successful on YouTube is make videos that people want to watch. Simple, isn’t it? Unfortunately, many of the tactics we’ve heard from creators to optimize for YouTube’s discovery features may in fact backfire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tactics?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, we’ve heard from some creators who intentionally made their videos shorter in an attempt to get a higher retention rate. Unfortunately, this won’t help. While high retention on your videos is a good indication of engagement, we are actually optimizing for how a video contributes to a <em>longer viewing session on YouTube</em>. So your video isn’t more likely to be seen just because it’s shorter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well duh, try the opposite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conversely, we’ve also heard from some creators who intentionally made their videos longer, assuming that longer videos lead to more watch time. This also isn’t necessarily true, because it can be more challenging to keep viewers engaged through a longer video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once upon a time, these kinds of numbers were the business of studio or network executives who would use them to breathe down the necks of creatives. Now they’re the bread and butter of “creators.”</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>I often wonder why Vimeo has better content than YouTube even though the latter has the vastly bigger audience. My guess is that YouTube creators want stats; Vimeo filmmakers want to share a story.</p>

<p>Make better content. Screw the numbers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/08/the-olympics-in-super-hi-visio.shtml">John Zubrzycki over at the BBC Research and Development Blog has a nice piece</a> on how, with the help of Japan’s NHK, the Olympic opening ceremony was shown to a select few in Super Hi-Vision (SHV), a video technology that makes HD look like SD and SD look like grease stains on a highway:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The SHV content has 16 times the data of HDTV, so rendering and processing time is slow, even using very powerful workstations. Even so, the NHK production team and a BBC editor are able to edit a new content package overnight ready for showing the next day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, did I forget to mention this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SHV has sixteen times as many pixels as HDTV making a picture with 7680 pixels across by 4320 pixels down. It was displayed on an 8-metre wide screen, accompanied by a 22.2 multichannel 3-dimensional sound system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, please.</p>
