  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08
/boxee-mubi.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/boxee-
mubi-300x167.jpg" alt="MUBI on Boxee" /></a>Two exciting announcements for cinephiles from the tech world
today. First off, Netflix has added iPhone and iPod Touch compatibility to its
widely used iPad application. I use the iPad app all the time, mostly for
catching up on television series, and the iPhone is a welcome addition.
Certainly, people will complain about the size of the screen and break out the
ever popular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKiIroiCvZ0">David Lynch YouTube
video</a>, but I think it’s a big
step in the right direction. The more screens available for content, the more
opportunities filmmakers have of reaching audience.</p>

<p>Secondly, early this morning <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee rolled out a new version of their Boxee
Beta</a>. The main improvement is what they are now calling
the “Movie Library”, a collection of streaming films from around the web all
in one place. Providers <a href="http://eztakes.com">EZTakes</a>, <a href="http://indiemoviesonline.com/">Indie Movies
Online</a>, <a href="http://mubi.com">MUBI</a> and
<a href="http://openfilm.com/">Openfilm</a> join <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>,
<a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> to
make for the most full featured, comprehensive library on the web.</p>

<p>MUBI, formerly The Auteurs, is perhaps the biggest part of this announcement
for cinephiles. Launched as a social network alongside the Criterion
Collection, MUBI has an incredible rotating collection of classic and
international cinema. Users can either pay a monthly fee of $12 for unlimited
access to the entire collection or rent films for $3 apiece. You account is
managed through MUBI’s site, allowing you to rent directly from Boxee on your
television.</p>

<p>At this point, there is no excuse to miss out on all of these great films.
Boxee is free so you can be up and running in no time. When the Boxee Box
comes out later this fall, it will be a simple plug and play matter to get all
of this content. Quality notwithstanding, has there ever been a better time to
be a filmmaker or audience member?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/63803_piranha.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08
/63803_piranha-300x179.jpg" alt="Piranha 3D Still" /></a>The legacy of <em>Piranha</em> lies in a
tradition of good effects work, fun horror tricks as well as poor
plot/storylines. And while the mixture of fun Joe Dante-cult series and smart
Alexandre Aja horror sensibilities are a combination for smart intentions,
this fare hits the “camp” quality too much on the mark.</p>

<p>There is so much delivery of sexualized pseudo-3D effects that the implicit
analysis of male-scopophilia is not balanced enough to warrant a congrats for
effective Hitchcock-ian application of technology and genre. While these
elements were not strong enough to combat 3D exploitable elements, they are
strong enough to summon a mention, as the message of the film should not go
without notice.</p>

<p>The context of the plot lies in the traditional alcohol-sexed teenaged beach
party of any aquatic horror, where the camera is immediately immersed in
overly objectifying 3D close ups of unidentified and scantily clad women.
While this is obviously what will sell tickets, in the tradition of this
genre, Aja also takes the length of the first act to deconstruct this gaze and
equate it with the horror of consumption found within the blood-seeking
monsters. For, just as in any sex-horror of the late 70s/early 80s, we find
those unwed teenagers that participate in any sexual activity are prone to
ill-conceived death and pain. Aja not only plays by the rules, but also
implicates the audience as both initiator of such desires, and executioner.
When the porn-star females lure the virginal female-love interest into the
Piranha-infested waters, it is up to a conflicted male to save her. What the
male is conflicted over is the point of the film’s deconstruction of gaze: the
desire to objectify from the safety of audience (depicted as he frames a
video-camera to record intended pornographic material) and the elimination of
such enticement (the death of those participating in this material). Aja not
only suggests this through the main character’s conflict, but solidifies this
theme when the audience is presented with a fascinating moment in which two
naked women rotate within water, presenting the moment of desire to experience
“everything” in 3D, but also anticipate the possibility of death for these
women at any moment. A terribly masochistic moment that reveals the true
nature of Aja’s <em>Piranha</em> horror.</p>

<p>While this initial setup seems an appropriate and intelligent use of 3D
technology, it does not satisfy the questions that arise about misogynistic
tendencies about this horror’s origin. The reason for the plot’s horror lies
in the accidental opening of a cavern beneath a lake, revealing a subterranean
lake from which prehistoric dangers lie. While there is nothing complicated
about these plot-facts, the camera reveals this “fissure” opening cavern in
framing that is quite vaginal, and once two scuba divers enter this “fissure,”
they find a cavern full of eggs, implicating the origins of this “horror” to
be quite feminine. The panic, disaster, and suffrage occurs from the birthing
of the young, revealing this horror to be male-centered.</p>

<p>The last balancing point lies in a smartly cast Elizabeth Shue, as the only
mother figure within the narrative who not only maintains a position of
authority as local sheriff, but displays a fearless heroism un equaled by any
other female figure. It is because of her initial calls for safety and plans
for survival that save some of these selfish and gland-driven teenagers from
complete disaster and (effective) carnage (not to mention saving her own pre-
teen children in need of babysitting).</p>

<p>While Aja misses with his normally well-balanced commentary-subtext and genre
exploitation, his entry into the <em>Piranha</em> franchise slides too perfectly into
traditional horror-genre sequel (with the assistance of quality work from
Gregory Nicotero).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/MAO1.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/MAO1-300x199.jpg" alt="Still from Mao's Last Dancer" /></a>Bruce Beresford’s <em>Mao’s Last Dancer</em> is a
film that cannot decide what it wants to be. The story of a Chinese dancer who
comes to Reagan’s America finding not only a passion for ballet but himself,
it is one part anti-communist manifesto with doses of Asian fetishism, one
part immigration caper, one part love story, one part alien comes to the
suburbs adventure (think <em>Mac and Me</em>) and one part dance film. The trouble is
that only one of these facets, the dance film, actually rises above the patina
of Hollywood fit and finish that will make you want to walk out of this film.
It’s not that Mr. Beresford made a terrible film, he simply made one that
discounts the last twenty years worth of intellectual growth we have achieved
both as filmgoers and international citizens.</p>

<p>The biggest redeeming factor of the film, besides the lovely dance sequences,
is Bruce Greenwood’s performance as Ben Stevenson, the kind, graceful,
enigmatic and at times manipulative director of the Houston Dance Company.
Under the auspices of a student exchange program, Stevenson brought Li Cunxin
(Chi Cao) to Texas after seeing his work in China. Raised by state ballet
instructors in a rigorous bid for cultural dominance, Li’s skill is unhoned;
very cold and mechanical, very Communist. Stevenson sees a project in Li, and
with hopes of being the first company to cross the red curtain, the exchange
is but one step in his own plan for cultural ascendance. Greenwood has an
impeccable ear for smarm, most recently in Jay Roach’s <em>Dinner for Schmucks</em>,
but the Stevenson character is something new, something wonderful. He has
imbued his entire being with a life of its own: a stride that only he could
pull off, an accent that ebbs and flows from soothing to irate between scenes,
and a giant pair of headphones that he manages to make look chic. It is an
impressive performance held back only by the thinness of the story as a whole.</p>

<p>Like any biopic, the goals of <em>Mao’s Last Dancer</em> are far reaching, too
strident to be told within the confines of a feature film. This is not only
the life of a man, but a geopolitical relationship that needs context in the
wake of the Beijing Olympics. In 2010, China isn’t exactly all that bad in the
eyes of Joe American, so time is wasted bringing us up to speed. The scenes in
China, where Li grows up inundated with the Communist dream, are cartoonish,
like something out of a 1940s newsreel. Teachers spew vitriol on the American
way of life, all to the enjoyment of at least the crowd I saw the film. How
stupid they are, thinking America is a wasteland. The irony I hope viewers
will recognize is that the lies the children learn of the U.S. is tantamount
to the film we are watching, this Chinese fairy tale. As it is when Li comes
to America, looking around as if he’s landed on the moon. It’s not that Li (a
real person, by the way) didn’t experience America in this way, confused by
t-shirts and wowed by skyscrapers, it’s that there is a story far more
interesting than that to be told.</p>

<p>The best off-stage sequence in the film could have been a feature in itself.
After a bold evening in which Li makes efforts to stay in the U.S. once his
visa expires, he and a gang of friends, lawyer in tow, go to the Chinese
embassy to explain why he is leaving. Of course, goons pop out of the shadows
and take him away, ready to move him back to his homeland and deny his U.S.
Status. This is the part that tries to become international intrigue. It falls
a little flat but is aware of its absurdity (“chairman meow”). As the scene
drags on, it serves as yet another reminder that this film cannot decide which
story it wants to tell. The one of a long night in an Embassy while the world
watches to see how two governments at odds with one another will react sounds
like a pretty good one to me, but instead it’s just an extended moment. We
never get inside of the real Li. His emotions are either too reserved or too
large. They involve crying, smiling, and expositing. Even the Chinese have
nuance to their emotions, but the way Li is written you wouldn’t think so.</p>

<p>One more thing. Narratively, this film doesn’t work for me, but there is
something about Mr. Beresford’s confused touch that is in part irresistible.
The scenes in China <em>feel</em> like an older film. The classroom sequences call to
mind some moments of Truffaut’s <em>The 400 Blows</em>, or perhaps Louis Malle’s <em>Au
Revoir Les Enfants</em>. Whatever I can say about this film, there are still
aspects of it that are mystifying, mostly on stage. It plays as corny and
simplistic, but it still looks good. For some, that may be enough.</p>

content/uploads/2010/08/net-neutral-300x262.png" alt="Net Neutrality for Filmmakers" /></a>On Monday, Google and Verizon
issued a joint proposal on the issue of network neutrality, or net neutrality.
In it, the companies map out how they feel on the subject and issue a list of
rules they believe should be adopted industry-wide. So what is this all about
and why should filmmakers care? Give me a few paragraphs.</p>

<p><strong>Brief Briefing</strong><br />
First, a definition from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">extensive Wikipedia
article</a>: “At its simplest
network neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be
treated equally.” You can read the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/35599242/Verizon-Google-Legislative-
Framework-Proposal">two-page
proposal</a>. If the lawyer-speak gets you down, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/09/google-and-verizons-
net-neutrality-proposal-explained/">Engadget’s Nilay
Patel offers a clear</a> breakdown of every point, while <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/theres-only-one-internet">John
Bergmayer at Public Knowledge gives some great
perspective</a> on
the implications of the document. If that’s not enough, you can read the joint
post on <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-and-
verizon-op-ed-path-to-open.html">Google’s</a> and <a href="http://policyblog.verizon.com
/BlogPost/742/JointPolicyProposalforanOpenInternet.aspx">Verizon’s</a> public policy blogs.
The two companies also co-authored an op-ed in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080905647.html">Tuesday’s Washington
Post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bits of Bits</strong><br />
There are two parts of Google and Verizon’s proposal that should worry
filmmakers and audience members alike. The first one is their provision for
“Additional Online Services”. There is no clear cut definition for what these
additional services could be, but when asked on a conference call, Verizon’s
CEO <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/08/09/google-and-
verizon-agree-to-net-neutrality-compromise/">Ivan Seidenberg used 3D content</a> as an example. If 3D content is
considered an additional service, then why not video?</p>

<p>Broadband high-speed Internet connections have become the norm in the last
decade, and the film industry has flourished because of it. Sites like iTunes,
Netflix, Amazon Video and YouTube offer filmmakers, both mainstream and
independent, more options for reaching out to audiences than ever before.
Thanks to the availability of high speed broadband connections, we can deliver
high quality video near-instantaneously. Also, as <a href="http://daily.greencine.com/archives/007875.html">Greencine Daily’s Vadim
Rizov pointed out recently</a>,
digitally equipped theaters represent about 15% of all movie screens
worldwide. Digital films are projected from a series of files, sent out over a
secure high-speed connection. Even productions make extensive use of
broadband, allowing for editors to be in one base location where footage can
be uploaded to them on a daily basis. In other words, the film industry relies
on incredible amounts of bandwidth.</p>

<p>But bits are bits and bytes are bytes, correct? This mention of additional
services suggests otherwise. The, proposal keeps things unclear (the whole
definition of these services is 106 words) but mentions “traffic
prioritization” as one use case, meaning some data will get to make use of
more badwidth while other data will not.  The fear in this case is that
Verizon, or any ISP for that matter, could offer lucrative prioritization
contracts to some movie companies, ones not viewed as competitors, while
leaving others out. Let’s say they strike a deal with AMC Theaters but not
Landmark, then Landmark would of course have to go with another ISP. But these
exclusivity deals would only go so far before either bandwidth runs out or
partnerships dry up, meaning the little guys won’t be able to compete anymore.</p>

<p>What happens when theatrical video file sizes become smaller and video codecs
become more robust? One day, perhaps, video streaming won’t require as much
bandwidth, but these services could already be in place. So those theaters who
are still around would still be paying for legacy technology for no reason.
Another example is video editing. Until Apple introduced its “ProRes 422
(Proxy)” codec, their larger “ProRes 422” was the smallest editable HD codec.
If a post-production companies leases bandwidth in order to move “ProRes 422”
because it is considered an additional service, will it be stuck with the same
agreement once it switches to “ProRes 422 (Proxy)” even though the files would
be small enough to use their standard broadband connection? Google and Verizon
have no answer to these questions.</p>

<p><strong>No Strings</strong><br />
The second, and more worrisome issue of the proposal is how the corporations
refer to wireless broadband technologies. They make a clear distinction
between wired and wireless, not based on connectivity but based on content and
services. While most of the proposal ensures an open Internet over a wired
connection, it makes no such provision for wireless technologies, citing its
“still-developing nature”. According to this plan, there become two Internets:
the wired and the wireless. Uh, what?</p>

<p>In my original <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-wave-for-
filmmakers-a-concept/">Google Wave for
Filmmakers</a> concept, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/08/05/google-wave-dead-but-not-the-
concept/">which I recently
revised</a> after Wave’s demise, I mentioned the possibility of cameras that
could upload footage straight to the web for editing by a remote team. Today’s
wireless systems, like those that provide Internet connections for iPhones and
Blackberrys, are not fast enough to handle the load of uncompressed video. One
day they will be, and when that day comes we will have professional-grade
video cameras with high-speed data connections. That way, you can shoot and
send your footage right to your editors, from anywhere in the world. Or will
that ability be hampered by Google and Verizon’s implication that wireless
data is somehow different from wired data?</p>

<p>On the distribution end of things, today’s most advanced smartphones can play
HD video on their high resolution screens, but there is still no way to get
that data to them over their wireless connections. HD streaming is usually
limited to WiFi connections, and downloads cap out at 10 or 20 megabytes
depending on your provider. These bottlenecks are purportedly in place to keep
the network active because it can’t handle the data load. An ulterior motive
could be that wireless providers, like Verizon and AT&amp;T, could strike
exclusivity deals with different content partners and share revenue from the
sales. In this case, Disney could sell it’s HD content wirelessly only to
Verizon customers. Independent filmmakers who don’t have the marketing power
to set up such contracts would be left out of wireless distribution
completely.</p>

<p><strong>Action!</strong><br />
This may all seem academic today, when digital projection is slowly getting
off to a start and highly compressed (read: crappy) mobile video is the norm.
In the next two decades, wireless broadband will probably supplant wired
broadband for most of our network solutions. Just look at how far mobile
computing has come in the last five years. Imagine what the landscape will be
like in one hundred years. Will we have set events in motion that limit
innovation and set back independent film distribution?</p>

<p>As an online publisher, a cinephile and someone who works in the film
industry, I am deeply disturbed by Google and Verizon’s proposal. I cannot
support it and I encourage you to learn about what’s at stake. The digital
revolution has invigorated the independent film movement, bringing films to
light that otherwise could not be funded/distributed. By giving up on the most
basic concept of the networked world, that there is one Internet, we are also
giving up on a bright future for cinema. <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/alertfax/3299">Public Knowledge has drafted a
letter you can send to your
congressperson</a>. Send it in,
take action, and voice your opinion.</p>

<em>Traffic</em> doesn’t sound appealing to you, then you should probably skip Joel
Schumacher’s disastrous <em>Twelve</em>. If that does sound right up your alley, then
you’re beyond help so do whatever you want. In what appears to have been
thrown together over a few weekends (it was actually shot in 23 days), the
film follows White Mike (Chace Crawford) a straight-edge drug dealer who
tailors to the Upper East Side’s teenage addicted denizens, over a fateful
three day period in which everything changes for everyone, or some such
nonsense. It’s a mess.</p>

<p>Now about White Mike. His restauranteur father has fallen on hard times, so he
dropped out of school and took on the task of dealing dope. The kids love him
since he is, or was, one of them. Anyway, his cousin gets high one night on a
new designer drug called Twelve, presumably because it’s a mixture of that
many psychotropics, and goes off to Harlem wielding a gun in hopes of scoring
more of the stuff. His plan doesn’t go off exactly as planned, which sorta
kinda sets events in motion so that White Mike learns something about himself.</p>

<p>The first question I get when I describe the plot of this film to friends is
“Who cares about rich white kids anyway?” I don’t see why we shouldn’t, but
this film doesn’t seem to understand the species at all. For example, in one
scene a fame-mongering girl dreams big, coercing a venue for her birthday
party by predicting the kind of party “Page Six” would notice. Not to diminish
the infamy of that gossip column, but has anyone involved with this film met a
teenager? Are they aware of blogs? This is one of many little problems that
make these kids not just vacuous, but wholly unrealistic.</p>

<p>What has always confounded me about Paul Haggis’s <em>Crash</em> (and its copycats,
for that matter) is that it tries to pawn off stilted intertwining plot lines
as something of actual substance. At least in the case of that film, each
strand was at least interesting. In <em>Twelve</em>, of the plot lines that I could
keep track of, only one showed any promise as an interesting narrative and it
goes forgotten and unresolved halfway through the film. That is the story of
Hunter, played by Philip Ettinger, a rich kid who heads to Harlem to play
basketball to let out his demons every so often. He is accused of a crime he
didn’t commit, too afraid to call his parents for help and too stupid to call
a lawyer. The setup for his story is pulpy enough that I’d love to see it
expanded into a whole film, perhaps a teenage remake of Fritz Lang’s <em>Fury</em>.
Unfortunately, once Hunter is no longer useful to advancing White Mike’s
limited storyline he is forgotten about.</p>

<p>There are a number of good performances from the young cast. Mr. Crawford does
a serviceable job in the lead role, but there’s so little to his character
that it’s hard to blame him for a mostly one-note outing. Emily Meade, as
Jessica, straddles the line of spoiled rich bitch and brainy valedictorian-
cum-drug addict. She is given one of the best reveals of the film, one in
which she offers her innocence in exchange fora hit of Twelve. Unfortunately,
Schumacher botches the whole moment by offering up a cheap joke that botches
the impact of the whole thing. Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is fine, but his role,
Lionel the drug dealer, changes motivation from scene to scene too much for
him to get an emotional handle on it. Kieran Culkin is best when not sulking,
which is unfortunate given his role as Chris, the chronically screwed
straight-arrow whose parent free house is host to the much debauchery.</p>

<p>There are many others in the film, but all the performances suffer from the
same problem: poor direction. It is obvious that this film was made quickly,
too quickly to allow any of them to fully develop a character. There are
moments where it feels like you are watching dailies instead of a finished
piece. There just isn’t enough coverage of good takes to pull this thing
together. It is Mr. Schumacher’s job to know his limits or push his actors to
fit the accelerated schedule. He didn’t succeed at either.</p>

<p>Finally, I have to mention the awful narration. Kieffer Sutherland reads what
I can only assume is the entirety of the novel by Nick McDonnell that the film
is based on sans dialogue. It is a whole not of narration, and there is no
justifiable reason for it except that this story is so thin they needed
something to get to feature length. Part of the reason the film is hardly
memorable is because narration will never take the place of well-developed
storytelling. Though the rules of cinema are not finite, “Show, don’t tell” is
a pretty big one. Sidestepping this completely, Sutherland’s narration is so
present, so constant, that it almost feels as though you are watching an
audiobook. A boring, unresolved and barely entertaining audiobook.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/brotherhood_3.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/brotherhood_3.jpg" alt="Brotherhood (Broderskab) Still" /></a>It is with grace, care and patience
that Danish director Nicolo Donato brings _Brotherhood (Broderskab) _to life.
A love story about homosexual neo-nazis, the plot is a fuse that others may
not see the point in lighting. It may sound too high concept to work, but
Donato has brought a surprisingly affecting story to life by developing rich
emotional palettes for the film’s main players, avoiding moral
proselytization.</p>

<p>Like many tales of unrequited love, this one gets off to a clunky start. At
the outset we meet Lars (Thure Lindhardt), a son of privilege on course for a
successful military career, is left unemployed after his underlings accuse him
of making advances at them. In an only moderately believable turn of events,
he happens upon a local chapter of white supremacists while drinking his
worries away at a friend’s house. Initially disgusted by their beliefs, he is
drawn to them, or rather pulled in for his eloquence and obvious curiosity.
Kicked out of his house after beating a Muslim, Lars is forced to move into
the summer home of the movement’s leader. There, he and Jimmy (David Dencik),
a senior member of the organization, must fix the place up in its owners
absence between party meetings, mosh pits and beachside burnings. They drink
organic beer and red wine, work at a snail’s pace and go for dips in the lake
when the mood strikes them. It is seemingly the plush life for these bigots.</p>

<p>In this exclusive club, there are the lowly followers, the idiots we think of
when we think of unrepentant racists, the boys who perhaps could not find
another strata of society that would take them on. Then there are the people
like Lars and Jimmy, the more intellectual neo-Nazis who choose to be there.
In Donato’s film, all of these “thinking” Nazis are portrayed as, how should I
put this, dandy. There is something decidedly homoerotic about a group of men
who get together to celebrate physical dominance, a note Donato hits on part-
way through the film at a hate-rock concert. In slow motion, the men sweat,
slap and surf on each other. It is around this point, in a mosh Lars would
rather sit out, that our main characters begin to fall for each other.</p>

<p>It is implied, strongly, that Jimmy has a history of lovers, perhaps within
the enclave. Fatso, the frightening recruiter played with wonderful restraint
by Nicolas Bro, spends much of his screen time leering at Jimmy, trying to
ensure he has not started up a relationship with Lars. Another interpretation
is that Fatso and Jimmy were perhaps involved at some other point. It’s
unclear because we only have their body language to go on. Try as he might,
Jimmy cannot resist Lars when no one is around. Lars would rather run away,
but the organization is the only family Jimmy has ever known and he refuses.
He would rather keep it a secret than suffer the consequences, which are as
bloody as you might imagine.</p>

<p>Thure Lindhardt and David Dencik offer up moving performances as our forbidden
lovers. We see Lars’s brief transformation from youthful go-getter to white
supremacists, but Jimmyhas obviously been torn about his decision to be
amongst Nazis since he made it. Lars was so embarrassed, so unable to speak of
the homosexuality that lead to his dismissal, that he would rather make
something of himself among bigots. Jimmy must have gone through the same
thing, only much harder, and at a much younger age than Lars. But could a
lifestyle that denies them who they are actually be worth it?</p>

<p>The real trick of Donato’s film is to make us even think in this way about
these despicable characters. A man who can perpetrate such acts of violence,
as they all do, is no man worth saving, no man deserving of happiness. They
shouldn’t even be worth our thoughts, let alone our compassion. Even for its
clunkiness, moving us a bit too quickly through the first act, <em>Brotherhood</em>
works as a love story and unexpected take on a world you may be unwilling to
enter. In the real world, I won’t find any place in my heart for bigots and
their blind followers. However, within the confines of this film, I may take a
second look at these unlikely companions.</p>

<p><em>Brotherhood opens in New York on August 6th and Los Angeles on August 20th.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/google_film_wave_dead_logo.png"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/google_film_wave_dead_logo-
300x262.png" alt="Google Wave Film Logo 2009-2010" /></a>Exactly 14 months ago,
shortly after its introduction, I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-
wave-for-filmmakers-a-concept/">outlined a concept for how Google Wave
could be used by filmmakers</a> (which I recommend reading before you go on).
The post was widely read, and even <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/surfs-up-wednesday-google-wave-
update.html">Google featured the
idea</a> as a potential use case scenario for its fledgling product. After
snagging a (relatively) early beta spot for the service, I witnessed how
filmmakers were attempting to make use of it. I should emphasize the word
attempting, because most users were completely lost on how to implement the
technology. Yesterday, Google announced it will stop developing the platform,
and has only promised to support their version of Wave through the end of
2010. Google Wave is dead. So is the Google Wave for filmmakers concept dead?</p>

<p><strong>Why Wave Died</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/Wave_Screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/Wave_Screenshot.jpg" alt="Google Wave Screenshot" /></a>Tech pundits will break this story
down from every direction, but I can offer a few armchair talking points on
the subject of Wave’s demise. The first and most important is that Google Wave
requires a new workflow but looks and feels like so many other, older
workflows. It feels like a document but looks like e-mail, and functions like
neither. It has all the downsides of chat, commenting and bulletin board
engines with none of the benefits of modern browsing and design. Basically,
when greeted with either a blank or a populated wave, every user approaches
adding to it differently, which leads not only to confusion, but clunky
performance. Worse still, nearly every basic use case for Google Wave is
superseded by a number of other web services.</p>

<p>But it’s not all bad. There is a reason why, when Google introduced Wave at
their I/O Conference in 2009, the web community at large became overwhelmed
with excitement, and it’s not just because of the company’s impressive track
record. Its promise was to bring e-mail into the 21st century by redesigning
it from the ground up. This promise became something of an albatross almost
immediately; it’s the reason so many people were confused when they opened up
a wave. Still, it’s the best effort there has been yet to organize the clunky,
unwieldy nature of message, reply, forward, and so on. Google has developed
some amazing technologies in Wave that will most likely end up elsewhere, such
as the ability to view live text edits from multiple collaborators. For a
company that thrives on innovation, Wave is nothing but a win for Google.</p>

<p>In the end, and it <em>is</em> the end, no one could find a killer use for the
product. The filmmakers whose waves I’ve participated in usually just let the
thing turn into a comment forum, basically a glorified blog post. Some have
tried to collaborate on screenplays, but Wave is not ready for documents that
long. Furthermore, even though Wave cleverly tracks changes, it <em>feels</em> like
destructive editing, and that’s a big deal to users. If you think you can’t
get a change back, you won’t make a change.</p>

<p><strong>Why “Wave” for Filmmakers isn’t Dead</strong><br />
Wave’s possibilities turned out to be far more interesting than its actual
uses. The key to the software was text manipulation and tracking among a
number of users. You could edit text collaboratively, and then embed that
information on a website. You could also bring various strands of data
(photos, videos) into a wave. The concept of one central, editable document is
what opened up the Google Wave for Filmmakers concept for me. That central
document, in my example an XML document, is the key to the idea. The hope,
originally, was that Google Wave would flourish and grow, allowing for the
kinds of hooks I mentioned. It hasn’t, and it won’t.</p>

<p>Centralizing film editing is not a new idea. Apple and Avid and other third
party hardware makers offer a number of solutions for getting multiple
editors, producers, writers and other creatives on the same page. However,
today, these technologies are extremely limited, usually requiring involved
parties to be in the same building. From a creative standpoint, this is an
idea that has worked for nearly a hundred years, since the advent of the
vertically integrated studio. Clearly, filmmakers demand a new level of
mobility and collaboration today. Why be tied to a single location? Why be
tied to a finite team even? Why not have people perform simple tasks in your
process to move things forward?</p>

<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong><br />
Technologically, we are at least a decade away from bringing all the strands
of moviemaking together in an intuitive manner. Video is one of the last
strongholds of supercomputing since it requires incredibly robust hardware.
For most consumer uses, desktop all-in-ones and laptop computers suffice for
nearly any task, including video editing. It wasn’t always that way. Ten years
ago, working with video on a laptop was something of a novelty, today it’s
become quite common, though not for processor heavy tasks like transcoding or
compositing. Computers are getting smaller and faster, and many basic tasks
have all but obliterated the need for hardware altogether. Look at word
processing, e-mail, basic photo editing, playlist creation, and even document
storage as just a few examples of cloud ubiquity where once hardware reigned.
It is not a matter of whether video editing will make it to the cloud, but
when.</p>

<p>For now, creators will keep on creating. Like anything else, these are just
tools. Google Wave was a bold move in the right direction towards central
collaboration. There is no way to look at this as a failure for Google, or for
any of us. The conversation has shifted. Now we need to take the momentum that
Google Wave kicked off and the tools it will leave behind to keep the
conversation up so that when the technology falls in line, we will be there to
adopt filmmaking methodologies that move us forward.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/Dinner_for_Schmucks.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/Dinner_for_Schmucks-
300x199.jpg" alt="Dinner for Schmucks Still" /></a>Halfway through the summer our
cinematic bloodlust has been sated: heroes worshiped, vampires sucked dry,
minds thoroughly fucked. Now, at long last, the time has come to be tickled,
and director Jay Roach delivers big with <em>Dinner for Schmucks</em>, undoubtedly
the biggest laugh-fest of the season. The plot is weak and the resolution full
of tired cornballery, but just as with his other franchises, <em>Austin Powers</em>
and <em>Meet the Parents</em>, Roach shows off his uncany ability to craft taut comic
setpieces, each more involved and convoluted than the next.</p>

<p>Paul Rudd plays Tim Conrad, a “stock broker, or something” looking to rise to
the heighst of the seventh floor by reeling in $100 million Swedish client.
The only thing between Tim and a juicy promotion is an idiot for a monthly
dinner held by his boss, in which a cabal of douchebags gathers to make fun of
the dumbest guest. To appease his kindhearted girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak),
Tim turns the dinner down until he (literally) runs into Barry Speck, a
lovable doofus played by Steve Carell. An amateur taxidermist who fits
deceased rodents into his “mouseterpieces”, Barry turns out to be the perfect
person to get Tim’s foot in the door. As he has done consistently ever since
his smash success with <em>40-Year Old Virgin</em>, Carell shines. Though Barry
shares a number of ticks and mannerisms with <em>The Office’s</em> Michael Scott,
there is no question that he is a wholly original take on the empathetic
schlemiel.</p>

<p>No matter how hard he tries, Barry cannot do anything right. Almost
immediately he brings Tim to the brink of destruction. He invites over an
insane stalker (played by the brilliant Lucy Punch, who probably has the most
laughs-per-minute in the film), tells Tim’s girlfriend to take a hike and
plays a part in destroying most of his living room. Of course, in trying to
fix everything Barry only makes things worse. The premise is as old as comedy
itself, but it is the players that all make it work so well here. In
particular there is a scene at a brunch meeting that provided one of the best
belly laughs I’ve had in awhile. You see the whole trainwreck predictable
unfurling, you just don’t think they will let the joke go that far; no one is
that unlucky. But they do, and we get to relish in the worst-case scanario
that is Tim’s weekend.</p>

<p>Now what’s up with that title? As I suspected, Barry Speck is classically
defined as a schlemiel; an unintetionally awkward nudnik. Schmuck is much more
visceral, much more derogratory. And then it dawned on me: the dinner is <em>for</em>
the schmucks; the douchebags. Their guests are the hapless schlemiels. Enter
the cornballery I mentioned earlier. <em>Dinner for Schmucks</em> is ultimately a
moral tale, one about showing your true colors and not judging books by covers
and other vomit inducing crap. If it were trying to live up to its Yiddishe
title, the whole of the story would serve as an open-ended joke on the viewer.
Instead it ties itself up in a neat little resolution.</p>

<p>Though <em>Schmucks</em> borrows a great deal from the film on which it is based,
Francis Veber’s <em>The Dinner Game</em>, it serves as another example of American
resolutions and how they differ from their European counterparts. Veber’s film
ends with a joke, one which gets the idiot back into all of the trouble he
started. Also, Rudd’s character is allowed to be a nice guy the whole time,
dipping into his dark side when necessary (“The Tim you don’t know”) to move
his status forward. In the original, the Rudd character is a complete asshole
who gets his comeuppance. In other words, the whole message is backwards. The
French jokes come from a much darker place than Roach’s. While this is not
necessarily a bat thing, the <em>Schmucks</em> smacks of saccharine in its final
frame.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the laughs are so tight I’ll set all of that aside. Roach’s
talent is constructing scenes and splendid looking from afar as a Rube
Goldberg machine. Seeing the likely outcome before anything happens (knowing
the sex-crazed stalker will screw everything up, recognizing that a blind
fencer could lead to no good, etc.) adds immensely to the delight of watching
the jokes come to life. For all its shortcomings, I laughed my ass off at this
film. Undoubtedly, it will be <em>the</em> summer comedy of 2010.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/get_low_01.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/get_low_01-300x200.jpg" alt="Get Low Still" /></a>Shortly after I saw Aaron
Schneider’s 1930s period piece <em>Get Low</em> at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival,
I coyly tweeted the following summation of the film: Boo Radley speaks. That
character was the first role Robert Duvall ever had in Robert Mulligan’s
adaptation of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. In the years since, he has enjoyed an
illustrious career at the crest of nearly every creative wave that has swept
over tinsel town. In Mr. Schneider’s film he plays Felix Bush, a Tennesse
recluse as enigmatic as Harper Lee’s Radley looking to reintegrate with the
town surrounding him before his last days. The trouble is, the more I play the
film over in my head, the more I understand why Boo Radley is allowed only a
single line of dialogue instead of his own book: the allure behind society’s
outliers is in the mystery surrounding their status, rarely in the unfurling
of that tale.</p>

<p>At the film’s outset, we come to recognize Felix as the village kook; a beardy
old man who gets his kicks scaring the hell out of kids and adults alike.
Duvall wears curmudgeon well, snarling glassy eyed at all he meets. The beard
is a mask, a source of power for him. Denied redemption from a holy man, Felix
heads to the next best thing: a money hungry funeral director, Frank Quinn,
played by Bill Murray, who doffs his signature deadpan smirk. Bush and Quinn
hatch a plan to have the whole town come out to celebrate Felix’s funeral,
only while he is still alive. Unorthodox, yes, but Felix is essentially
sitting on piles of cash which Frank can’t wait to get his hands on. And so
the game is on.</p>

<p>First order of business, unfortunately, is to lose Felix’s beard. Now, Duvall
is Duvall with or without a great big beard, but everything seems to change
for some reason once it goes away. It is much easier to understand Felix, to
relate to him, once he looks like everybody else, which frustrates me. His
aged, bare face warrants empathy immediately, which is just too easy. There is
no real obstacle for the townspeople; why not go to the living funeral of the
weak-looking rich old man?</p>

<p>Sissy Spacek plays Mattie Darrow, one of the only people in the town who
smiles when she sees Felix. She is also one of the only people who knows the
truth about his past, about the events that turned him into a recluse. The
role comes with a lot of baggage, but Ms. Spacek is up to the task. Her and
Mr. Duvall put on a wonderful show, including a lovely candlelit scene. In
both their cases, and even moreso for Bill Murray, the trick to their
performances is in their eyes. The toughest way to transcend stardom and enter
a new character is to get your eyes to do the talking <em>as</em> someone else. The
leads here are all incredible talents who deliver to-rate performance, which
more likely than not will earn at least a few nomination come awards season.</p>

<p>In the end, however, <em>Get Low</em> is a story about a story, and not such an
involved one at that. The whole film, we are promised a payoff at the end, as
the whole town is. What makes Felix Bush tick? It is hinted at throughout, but
never in a meaningful way. Instead Mr. Schneider and writer Chris Provenzano
and C. Gaby Mitchell save the whole of his tale for the hurried ending, which
does not quite live up to the anticipation. It is billed as a reveal, only
nothing is revealed at that point that we didn’t already know, except of
course the intentionally held back facts.</p>

<p>It seems out of place for a film as emotionally driven as this one to rely on
simple facts, the simple narrative of Felix Bush, as harshly as it does. It is
a confusing mix to be sure, and one that will please some and frustrate
others. The leads pull this film through right up to the bitter end, but even
the high points can’t fix the jumbled narrative</p>

The moniker “experimental” has become tainted, misused, destroyed as of late. Most festivals around the world now feature a section for experimental films, usually shorts, but their definition is cloudy at best, and when it comes down to it, they are generally populated with films that simply won’t fit anywhere else. Which is why we have a responsibility to constantly, vigorously demand an answer to the simple question: “What’s the experiment?” With the films of Stan Brakhage, you never have to ask, but that doesn’t mean the answer is any clearer.</p>

<p>After a modicum of success with the comprehensive, albeit disjointed, two disc set of Brakhage’s works in 2003, Criterion is back with a second helping of the avant-garde pioneer’s films with <em>By Brakhage: An Anthology, Volume 2</em>. The set is not only a brilliantly curated look at the career of a prolific filmmaker, but it is also a major milestone for the Criterion Collection itself. It is almost inherent in the nature of experimental cinema that it not be released on home video. More often than not, the experiment is finite, contained within a movie house or screening room, a public space or gallery. That is why the first volume of the series was so jarring to viewers: it was a pile of films where the new set is carefully prepared, divided into 90 minute sessions. One of the major barriers to home viewing has been obliterated by the team behind this disc, which includes Brakhage’s wife, Marilyn, as well as film historian Fred Camper.</p>

<p>But what of the films? I have to admit that when I first received the three disc package, containing of 8 hours of material, mostly silent, I was quite worried about how I would make it through any of the films. Luckily, the curators predicted my apprehension, so the set starts off with <em>The Wonder Ring</em>, a beautiful little film that breaks down any such worries. A very early example of Brakhage’s powers, the film follows a simple premise: ride the Second Avenue El in New York City before it is to be demolished. The result is a wonderful collection of precious, cropped moments that would become the hallmark of his career. We all know what it is like to ride a train, but there are aspects of that experience that get lost on us. Those are specifically the areas where Brakhage trains his camera. There are no characters, just an exploration of the train’s space, the interplay of light and dark within its confines. Immediately, I forgot that there was no sound in this film, my brain was too busy processing the dense visual information.</p>

<p>Another standout (I can’t mention them all, though they all beg mentioning) is <em>Scenes from Under Childhood, Section One</em>. This film, the first in a four part series, is perhaps the clearest representation of Brakhage’s visual manifesto. As Scott MacDonald articulated in his <em>A Critical Cinema 4</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Brakhage theorized that acculturation generally involves the gradual constriction of the freedom of sight we witness in young children so that, as we mature, we come to understand what is socially acceptable to look at and how we should look at what we see. Conversely, this process of acculturation also involves learning what dimensions of the visible we must not look at.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With <em>Section One</em>, Brakhage makes this theory as cinematically clear as possible. No narrative becomes immediately clear to the viewer as the film unfolds; in fact a narrative undermines the concept of “under childhood”, the time before a child’s visions are trained. As the screen pulses from red to yellow to black and back, the effect plays out as a child opening and closing his eyes, playing with newfound light. Interestingly, Brakhage prepared a soundtrack for the film, which was originally screened as a silent. Criterion has made this film available with or without the sound, though it is so visually dense, the soundtrack only seems to confuse things, perhaps why he decided to keep the film silent. That being said, the soundtrack itself is a wonderful relic.</p>

<p>Later in life, under financial strain, Brakhage started working with hand- painted films. Though his most famous film, <em>Mothlight</em> (in the Volume One set), features only celluloid manipulation by pressing moth wings, leaves and dirt into film, most of the films in his career featured footage shot with a camera, though even then they were so affected by hand that it was only a natural progression to move to painting. There are few things as satisfying as seeing an artist realize a second calling later in life. <em>From: First Hymn to the Night — Novalis</em> is extraordinary film that melds Brakhage’s long tradition of rhythmic silent filmmaking with his attuned painterly hand. For a film with no sound, the best way to describe this one is “musical”. Featuring English excerpts from the poem by Novalis scratched into the film, Brakhage fills the screen with his moving, literally, watercolors. As the piece expands (it is under 3 minutes), you start to “see” the notes that he is trying to hit. I’ll be damned but I was actually singing the words in my head as they appeared on screen.</p>

<p>Even with their growing library and the ever-expanding Eclipse collection, <em>By Brakhage: An Anthology, Volume 2</em> along with its predecessor may just be the most comprehensive retrospective ever released by Criterion. Besides the wide array of films featured here, there are also interviews, lectures and short documentaries by other filmmakers about Brakhage on all three discs. Not only a student of cinema but a teacher, for most of his life he was able to sustain himself and his family by touring as a lecturer. As evidenced in the supplemental materials, he could talk forever about art, poetry, light and their interplay in his work. In a 1990 interview, after admitting he nearly threw up while looking at a Botticelli painting, he proffered “I’m very suspicious of anything but music”. He even explains the lineage of the word “experimental” in one interview, which he claims was initially pejorative until he and his colleagues waved it as a flag.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to the issue of “What is the experiment?” For so many filmmakers, the experiment exists within the form, within the barriers of cinema itself. For Brakhage, his life’s work was ultimately an experiment in vision. Perception is everything, and we may never know what precisely he perceived in our world. But with some 300 films to his name and these wonderful collections as bread crumbs to go by, we are given a great little peek into his world.</p>
