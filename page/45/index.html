  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just finished up listening to this week’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/afterdark/164">Back to Work After Dark</a> where Merlin Mann made a throwaway comment about Ross McElwee’s excellent film, <em>Sherman’s March</em>. I don’t know if it’s as well-known as Merlin makes it out to be so I figured I’d link it here. You can nab the DVD on <a href="http://amzn.to/JuCPTG">Amazon</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or watch it streaming on <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/Sherman_s_March/60035348">Netflix</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps seeing the film’s complete title will titillate you further. <em>Sherman’s March: A Meditation on the Possibility of Romantic Love In the South During an Era of Nuclear Weapons Proliferation</em>. Check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kirk Semple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/nyregion/for-some-new-york-immigrants-vhs-is-king-for-movie-rentals.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">reporting for <em>The New York Times</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this age of online streaming and Blu-ray Discs, there is still a place where the bulky VHS cassette endures: the immigrant communities of New York City.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be sure to watch the <a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/05/28/nyregion/100000001514701/vhs-loyalists.html">accompanying video</a>.</p>

<p>My love of VHS has less to do with nostalgia and more to do with the privilege of having a unique viewing experience. The defining film for me was Ingmar Bergman’s <em>Cries and Whispers</em>, which looks astounding (and totally different) on VHS. Similarly, Lindsay Anderson’s <em>If….</em> is almost a different movie on DVD than it is on VHS.</p>

<p>In both cases I’d still choose the DVD/Blu-ray version (of course), but it’s always nice to see how organic even these home video formats can be. Glad someone is keeping it alive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Gruber on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/05/about_the_talk_show">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two years ago, Dan had the idea to launch and grow a podcast network targeted not necessarily at the biggest tech/nerd audience, but rather the <em>best</em> tech/nerd audience. He was right, it worked, and I’m proud The Talk Show was a part of that. Lastly, to long-time listeners of the show, I want to express my sincere appreciation for your support, feedback, and attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/26/daring-firebrand/">just saying</a> that Gruber takes his time but generally gets it right when he posts a non-linked list piece.</p>

<p>Good stuff. Would’ve been better before the show launched.</p>

<p>Oh yeah: he’s selling the show’s ads directly and they cost 12.5 times what a usual Mule Radio Syndicate <a href="http://muleradio.net/sponsor/">ad spot</a> goes for. That should give you a clue as to what the 5by5 business disagreement was.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, John Gruber released the <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/2/">second episode of his revamped <em>The Talk Show</em> podcast</a> over at Mule Radio Syndicate. His guest was filmmaker and fellow podcaster <a href="http://adamlisagor.com/">Adam Lisagor</a>. As promised in the show’s notes, part of their discussion revolved around Gruber’s moving the show <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">away from Dan Benjamin’s 5by5 network</a>.</p>

<p>Gruber admits that the way he launched the new show, by not mentioning the split on the first episode,  was “dishonest.” So he lays out as much as he’d like to share. The schism stemmed from a “longstanding and significant” business disagreement between John and Dan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dan, the co-host, is obviously very popular and extremely talented. He’s extremely good at what he does and I’m super proud of the work we did together. And I think we had lots of good shows and some great shows. Dan, the owner of a podcast network, I have longstanding disagreements with. Came to an end. Why did I take <em>The Talk Show</em> with me? Because I love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gruber makes the case that the branding, artwork and overall idea of <em>The Talk Show</em> stemmed from him. He considers it his “second most-beloved child, creation,” and he didn’t want to leave it behind when he left 5by5.</p>

<p>You’ve got to respect Gruber’s honesty in this episode. He wants to get his side of the story out but in a way that is as friendly as possible. Lisagor joins in to Socratically extract John’s statements on the matter. If he had written what he was thinking, it would have been cold. Even the block-quote above sounds more unfeeling than the way Gruber presents it in the episode.</p>

<p>There’s one thing I don’t understand, though. Gruber concedes that Dan wouldn’t have continued <em>The Talk Show</em> without him. Why, then, would John want to do the show without Dan? I understand how much he loves it, but, as Adam point out, it’s just a title.</p>

<p>When David Letterman moved from NBC to CBS, he couldn’t take his show’s name, <em>Late Night</em>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with him. So he used a different name, <em>The Late Show</em>, and built a successful brand around it. Had Gruber launched the new show with a different name I’ll bet there would have been significantly less blowback and more room for him to cultivate his old fan-base.</p>

<p>But that’s not how things played out. Instead, Gruber wrested the show from Dan. The battle is over, and John won. He got to keep his show and now he gets to do it on his own terms.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading Daring Fireball for years and, in all honesty, none of how this series of events played out surprises me. John’s style is to be as open and forthright, even (and often) at the expense of anyone else in the industry is covering, as possible. That is once he knows what he wants to say. Readers of the site are used to this. He’ll ignore a specific topic for some time, or he’ll be posting noticeably less content for a few days until a lengthy and eloquent ★-toting post goes up. And he nails it.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that this episode, titled “Dare I Say, Kubrick?”, is exactly him nailing it, but it is clearly Gruber being Gruber. And that’s what was missing from his first episode last week. By ignoring the obvious storm that was brewing around him, John was missing the chance to own a story of his own making.</p>

<p>Or, he was waiting for it to get big enough that he could come along and have the last word.</p>

<p>Either way, I’d say this whole affair is an example of everything we love and everything we hate about John’s style, which is to say that he’s still at the top of his game.</p>

<p>The new <em>Talk Show</em> sounds like it has a lot of great surprises in store.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nathan Ingraham <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/25/3041936/netflix-frenemy-cable-tv-establishment">over at The Verge</a> reports from the 2012 Cable Show where Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s Chief Content Officer, spoke on a panel alongside cable executives:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Sarandos didn’t issue a firm denial, his response made it pretty clear that he didn’t believe Netflix was to blame for Nickelodeon’s troubles. He noted that the Netflix programming strategy “is mostly around high engagement, and we get there through personalization. And because of that, people’s tastes are so diverse that no specific network or no specific show has such high viewing concentration that you’d see that kind of cause and effect on ratings.” Still, he was quick to point out a counter-example that gives Netflix some credibility with the networks, saying that “in the gap between season four and season five [of <em>Mad Men</em>], we brought maybe a million new viewers to AMC for the new season.” He believes that Netflix played a role by giving viewers “a good opportunity, and a well-priced model and well-distributed model to catch up on the show.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, okay. There’s no way to track cause and effect, <em>but</em> Netflix is the reason <em>Mad Men</em> got a million new viewers this season. Sounds reasonable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I missed <a href="http://tracks.ranea.org/post/23490307864/disrupting-hollywood-by-way-of-talk-radio">this piece</a> from Watts Martin earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m quite skeptical of the notion that the way the Internet will disrupt Hollywood is by giving everyone the tools to make their own media. Everyone <em>does</em> have the tools to make their own media, to be sure; at least on the Mac, you can do some pretty high-grade stuff just with Garage Band and iMovie if you learn how to use them. However, a lot of what Hollywood produces still requires Hollywood resources. A garage filmmaker could spring for Final Cut Pro, but the box does not include a polished script, professional matte and CGI illustrators, makeup and costume artists, and Katee Sackhoff as the tough but sensitive female lead.</p>

  <p>What <em>can</em> be disrupted this way, though, is anything that really <em>doesn’t</em> require that kind of crew and special effects budget. Things like talk shows, especially audio-only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He comes to the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/23/newish-media/">same conclusion I did</a> when breaking down the niche news blitz around <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">John Gruber’s 5by5 split</a>: that new media outlets can garner audiences as loyal and vociferous, if not as big, as their terrestrial forbears.</p>

<p>Where I disagree with Martin is the notion that Hollywood is somehow impenetrable because of their vast resources. I’ve seen plenty of big hits that have had terrible scripts, some that have even made a billion dollars, so I’m not sure <em>that’s</em> the secret sauce in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Garage filmmakers may not be able to make blockbusters, but I do think they can hold their own otherwise if they take the medium as seriously as top-tier podcasters do. That’s a big if, though.</p>

<p>This week saw the launch of <a href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a>, a link gathering/curation service from Arc90, the folks behind <a href="http://www.readability.com">Readability</a>. On launch day I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/22/on-readlists/">took a look at the service</a> and found it to be a tool that doesn’t fulfill a need I have, but others have taken it for a spin and done some neat things.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>Just as when Readability launched, Readlists has been met with some harsh criticism about how it deals with authors’ content. I’m not quite ready to pass judgement either way, but I am curious. So I emailed Richard Ziade, Arc90’s lead strategist, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/03/06/richard-ziade-interview/">again</a> to ask him to clarify a few things about Readlists. Here is our full conversation.</div>
