  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candle
rblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rememberthetitans_pg01.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/04/rememberthetitans_pg01-300x150.jpg" alt="Not Clash of the Titans - Happy April Fools" /></a>Move over
<em>Avatar</em>, there’s a new king of 3D in town and his name just happens to be
Persius. Where else can you see Sam Worthington jumping onto CG birds? Not in
that $500 million film. Support independent filmmaking and definitely give a
click to Louis Leterrier’s greatest film since <em>Hulk</em>. <em>Clash of the Titans</em>
is a mile a minute thrill ride that sucks you in early and never lets go. How?
Because it’s 3 frickin’ D.</p>

<p>The film opens in the heavens, just like all Greek mythology films should. As
we whip around space and time, our eyes are vacuum sealed to every frenetic
movement. In plain old 2D, we would never get the full Greek effect, but since
this film adds the real-time additional graphics, our minds get blown right
away. It is truly the most amazing film I’ve seen this quarter, so far.</p>

<p>The team behind this film met the daunting task of a remake quite well. Though
the original film, directed by Ray Harryhausen, is regarded by many as an
untouchable classic of the cinema, the problem with that 1963 film was that
they hadn’t yet invented 3D. It looks dumb now looking back on it, but for
it’s time it really was a major advancement. Except for the 3D, this is
basically a shot for shot remake, except Hercules is completely written out of
the plot. The only place where they lose points is for completely stealing the
look and feel of <em>300.</em> Maybe it is meant as an homage to Zack Snyder, whose
unrelenting artistry compels filmmakers around the world.</p>

<p><em>Sam Worthington is truly the actor of our times, especially for his ability
to jump  onto birds. I don’t know how he does it, but I head he trains parkour
about three hours every day. Liam Neeson brings his godly charm to the role of
Zeus. His brother, Hades, is portrayed with scathing accuracy by Josef
Fiennes, who is reunited with Liam for the first time since _Schindler’s
List</em>. It’s weird how they’re both type cast again as good guy and bad guy. Do
these guys have another note?_</p>

<p>Finally, I want to mention all the animosity that has been brewing about this
film. A lot of people are talking about how they added the 3D after they shot
the film in 2D, as if this somehow cheapens the effect. This is total
bullcrap. This movie looks absolutely amazing in 3D. Wah wah wah, you need to
pay an extra 10 or 12 dollars to see it 3D. Go back to your trust funds and
live a little. After all it’s a just a movie so who really cares about it
anyway? You should, that’s why you pay the extra price to see an amazing 3D
movie. The titles practically fly right at your face! I hope Jim Cameron
didn’t see this because he’s gonna be pissed that Zeus stole his thunder,
literally.</p>

<p>If you are a new reader to the candler blog, then I welcome you and I hope you
take a poke around. If you are a regular then I hope you quickly realized that
something was up the second you laid eyes on this post.</p>

<p>The above post is a parody of the worst film writing I have seen out there.
Besides the typos, incomplete (or overlong) sentences, and misinformed facts,
the real trouble with this review is that it doesn’t really say anything. That
means it isn’t criticism at all, it’s just a rant.</p>

<p>I believe that the film writing we do here, most of the time, goes beyond the
rantings and ravings of a film-loving lunatic. There’s a time and a place for
that, but it doesn’t always lead somewhere you want to be. Click around the
candler blog and see what you find. I hope you find that critical writing is
alive and well…on the internet…on a blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/coldweather.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/coldweather-300x169.jpg" alt="Still from Aaron Katz's Cold Weather" /></a>A 2007 New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/movies/19lim.html">article by
Dennis Lim</a> defined
Mumblecore thusly: “Specimens of the genre share a low-key naturalism, low-fi
production values and a stream of low-volume chatter often perceived as
ineloquence.” All of the above qualifications could be applied to Aaron Katz’s
new film, <em>Cold Weather</em>, but it isn’t your average twentysomethings-talking-
about-stuff movie. It is a whodunnit thriller whose brilliance lies in its
ability to keep you guessing what “kind” of a film you are watching.</p>

<p>Doug is a half-bearded college graduate bumming it on his sister Gail’s couch
in Portland, working at an ice factory while he decides what to do with his
degree in forensic science. When his ex-girlfriend Rachel comes to town for a
visit, things start to get complicated. His coworker, Carlos, is absolutely
smitten Rachel, which brings on a wonderfully set up love triangle. Just as
you think the two friends might come to blows over the lovely lady in their
lives, Rachel goes missing which forces Doug to use the skills he learned at
school (and by reading Sherlock Holmes all day). That’s the short of it.</p>

<p><em>Cold Weather</em> works extremely well as a small, talky romance. It hits every
emotional point spot on, and finishes off with a nice moment of realization.
There is some absolutely gorgeous photography, provided by Andrew Reed. There
is a lovely little scene where Doug and Carlos uphold a conversation while
moving boxes of ice. The handheld camera follows the two around with very few
cuts. The conversational long take is a go to choice for many low-budget
filmmakers and it is often botched, but the movement and the motivation of the
entire scene show the steady hand of a powerful visual team. Then there’s that
waterfall shot. Before I saw the film, a colleague mentioned “there’s this
waterfall shot, you just have to see it”. He was right, and I’ll pass the tip
on, but I can’t exactly explain it.</p>

<p>Cris Lankenau, whose deadpan rivals the best of them, keeps things interesting
as Doug. Coupling him with Raúl Castillo, who plays Carlos, brings some lovely
little sparks. If Cris is playing a Peter Pan trying to find his way as an
adult, Raúl is the Toys-R-Us kid who never grew up. Trieste Kelly Dunn rounds
out the mystery solving team as Gail. Though she is the closest thing to a
voice of reason here, she balances the challenges of playing mother and sister
nicely.</p>

<p>This is probably an overstatement, but <em>Cold Weather</em> feels to the Mumblecore
movement what Lars Von Trier’s <em>Dancer in the Dark</em> was to Dogme 95, which to
say it is simultaneously a break and a progression. That <em>Cold Weather</em> works
without the thriller plot-line is a testament to Mr. Katz’s wide ranging
skills. That it is able to transcend the genre (which isn’t really a genre)
proves his creative force as a director. I hope that he has more tricks up his
sleeve, but even more-so I hope that other filmmakers see the possibilities
for indie cinema that are displayed in this film. The next decade of
Mumblecore now has an extremely high bar set for it.</p>

content/uploads/2010/03/agb2-300x241.jpg" alt="3D Rig used for Annie Goes Boating" /></a>As Hollywood enjoys this latest wave of 3D
filmmaking, I have long hoped that their innovations would eventually trickle
down to benefit the independent filmmaking community. Noel Paul’s short film,
<em>Annie Goes Boating</em>, which just had its world premiere here at SXSW, may be
the film that proves indie directors are dying to get their hands on the
technology. Gone are the flaming projectiles and the prickly protrusions that
are commonly found in big budget 3D films. Instead, Noel gives us a gorgeous
look at a day in the park.</p>

<p>I sat down with Noel to discuss how he was able to make this film on an indie
budget. Once he realized he had access to two Red Digital Cinema cameras, the
filmmaker went to work with his creative team to try to hack together a
workable 3D rig. However, it wasn’t until he got in contact with Lightspeed
Design, whose DepthQ technology is used in a number of 3D applications, that
the pieces really began to come together. The result is a 10 minute short that
is absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p><em>Annie Goes Boating</em> feels like a painting, one you could get up and walk
around in. The plot is simple by design: some friends go boating and play
badminton; a love triangle appears and then it ends. The photography, by
Michael Ragen, is reminiscent of impressionist painting. Your eye is free to
wander around the woods throughout the film. The depth is astounding. Some
shots of ducks on a pond make you feel almost as if you could touch the water,
as if the ducks might fall off the screen. Perhaps I’m romanticizing it, but
if you see the film in 3D you will understand my reaction.</p>

<p>It is great to listen to Noel talk about 3D technology and how he likes to use
it. I can’t think of another independent filmmaker who has tried a hand at 3D,
but I truly hope that it sticks. Noel doesn’t care to guess whether or not 3D
will catch on, but he says that he has every intention of making more 3D films
if he is able to get them off the ground. With this one under his belt, I
don’t see how that could be a problem.</p>

<p>I have hardly scratched the surface here. Listen in to my conversation with
Noel Paul, where he gets into some of the nitty gritty of 3D production as
well as speaks on his artistic influences behind this film. It’s one of the
most interesting conversations I’ve had on the subject. Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/tinyfurniture_officialstill_300dpi.jpg" title="Still from Tiny Furniture" /></p>

<p>Lena Dunham’s <em>Tiny Furniture</em> just had its world premiere here at SXSW yesterday. It is an extremely funny and revealing film from this New
York-based director. This is only her second feature, though she views it as her first since her last film, Creative Nonfiction, which
premiered at SXSW 2009, was about an hour long. Taking full advantage of the Austin vibe, Dunham made some friends here a year ago, gathered
a crack team in New York City, and spent the last year making this new film.</p>

<p>Her hard work paid of well. <em>Tiny Furniture</em> is ferociously funny and with a heart to boot. It is easy to apply the label of “coming of age
tale” to the film, but that really undersells it. This is not the kind of movie that involves staring into puddles, mirrors or other
reflective surfaces that twenty-somethings on film seem to be attracted to. Instead, we find Aura, played by Ms. Dunham, returning home to
the big apple after college, thrust into a world with no structure, few consequences and little prospects. Between her genius younger sister
soaking up the limelight and her preoccupied artist mother, Aura must blaze her own path in the naked city.</p>

<p>I sat down with Lena to discuss her process and her film. Listen in for some really interesting details about the making of this film, which
was shot entirely on the Canon 7D, a digital still camera that also shoots video. And there’s more! But you have to click play or download.</p>

<p>You can learn more about <em>Tiny Furniture</em> at the film’s <a href="http://www.tinyfurniture.com/">Official Website</a>. The film will be screening once
more at SXSW on Saturday, March 20, 4:15pm at the Alamo Ritz.</p>

content/uploads/2010/03/Crying_With_Laughter.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/Crying_With_Laughter-
300x199.jpg" alt="Crying With Laughter Still" /></a>Justin Molotnikov’s <em>Crying
With Laughter</em> was the first screener I watched in advance of SXSW this year.
Though it is described as a thriller, that is a particularly unfair label to
put on it. When I sat down with Justin, who is here in Austin for the North
American premiere of his film, I learned that he couldn’t agree more, and in
the best of senses.</p>

<p>The film follows down-on-his-luck comedian Joey Frisk, whose visceral brand of
jokes can be tough to laugh at. Very quickly the film changes its tone from
the mundane to the mysterious. Then  again to the adventurous, and eventually
to the melancholy. The brevity with which it moves from emotion to emotion, or
from genre to genre, is astounding. <em>Crying With Laughter</em> will surprise you
around every turn.</p>

<p>Justin and the film’s producer, Claire Mundell, took some time out of their
schedule to sit with me and discuss their film and some other tid-bits.
Perhaps the most interesting thing Justin and Claire mention is that the
script grew out of a lot of workshopping and improv. In fact, they say, it was
easier to get the film funded without a script than it would have had they had
a finished one from the outset. Sound backwards? Listen in as they explain
their process in making this first feature.</p>

<p><em>Crying with Laughter</em> has two more screenings at SXSW: Tuesday March 16th,
1:30am at the Alamo Ritz and Wednesday, March 17th, 4:30pm at the Alamo Lamar.
It is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crying-
Laughter-SXSW-Festival-Premiere/dp/B003AOI6DQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=digital-
video&amp;qid=1268752572&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon Video On Demand</a> and will soon be available on demand through your
cable provider in the U.S. You can find out more information at the film’s

<p>See <em>Marwencol</em>. That’s it. I can try to explain it to you, I can try to let you know how I feel about it, but you and can’t really talk about <em>Marwencol</em> until you see <em>Marwencol</em>.</p>

<p>Okay, I’ll tell you a few things about it since you asked so nicely. The film follows Mark Hogancamp, a man who starts his life over after being beaten half to death. Once he can walk and talk and read again, he begins to learn a few things about his former life, of which he remembers nothing. He was a drunk; a drunk who kept detailed and often horrific journals of his darkest moments. As he slowly tries to put his life together, the pain of dealing with his attack and coming to terms with his former self, he begins practicing his own kind of unconventional therapy.</p>

<p>Mark has built a 1/6th scale WWII Belgian town he calls Marwecol. It is populated with dolls who all have a real world doppelganger, people close to Mark in his everyday, full-scale life. He dresses the characters up, creates plots for them to carry out, and photographs their goings on. The level of authenticity Mark keeps the world running at is astounding. The guns soldiers carry have moving parts. He wheels around a truck full of character so that the truck doesn’t look like it just came out of the box. He wants everything to be as real as possible in Marwencol.</p>

<p>There is more to Mark’s story, a lot more. Director Jeff Malmberg had great access to all things Hogancamp, including his family, his coworkers, and of course the town itself. Narratively, the film progresses in a manner that keeps things interesting. Mark’s former selkf, and current one, has a lot of skeletons in his closet which slowly come out as the film goes on. I would have wanted more from the cinematography of the film, however. I realize it’s a documentary and the character profile here is of the utmost importance, but when you are focusing in on a 1/6th scale world it would be great to have some nicer macro photography. Perhaps I’m spoiled or asking the world, but given how beautifully twisted the town of Marwencol can become, I would love to have seen it more vividly. Like I said, the character here is key, and boy oh boy what a fascinating story Mark Hogancamp has. This is definitely one worth seeing.</p>

<p>You can learn more about <em>Marwencol</em> at the film’s <a href="http://www.marwencol.com">Official Website</a>. There is one more SXSW Screening on Friday March 19th, 1:15 at the Alamo Ritz.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/kickass1_gallery_primary.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03
/kickass1_gallery_primary-300x207.jpg" alt="Still from Kick-Ass" /></a>Kick-Ass</em> fits perfectly
into the SXSW landscape as it is what we in the business call a “crowd-
pleaser”. The trick here is that Matthew Vaughn’s film pleases a very specific
crowd, and Austin seems to be the capital not just of Texas, but of the
cynical fanboy (fangirl, fanperson). Based on the comic book series by Mark
Millar, <em>Kick-Ass</em> tells the tale of a mild-mannered high school geek who
gives into his fantasies of becoming a super hero. The story is tight enough,
the visuals pop, and the gore is outrageous. Still this film is missing
something pretty big: an audience outside of Austin.</p>

<p>Let me tell you what we have before I go into my opinion. In a cartoonish New
York City, one ruled by organized (and not so-organized) crime, Dave Lizewski
is a loser at the bottom of every food chain. He gets picked on at school,
mugged in the streets and nothing but bored at home. On the brink of growing
up, he decides to try his hand at being a super hero. After ordering a wet-
suit online, he goes out to fight some crime and eventually becomes an
internet sensation. Of course, there has to be some darkness to any super
tale. <em>Kick-Ass</em>, as Dave has named himself, quickly discovers that there are
villains more evil than he can handle, and heroes more well-equipped than he
could imagine. Accidentally, he has thrust himself into a war for the ages:
good versus evil.</p>

<p>The film balances two very different but overlapping genres with great
finesse. It is a comic book adaptation and a parody of comic book cinema. As a
comic book film, it ticks off marks on the list of required content. Bright
colors and inspired production design, provided by cinematographer Ben Davis
and production designer Russell De Rozario, make almost every frame feel like
it lives on a page. Overlaid text boxes fill out the effect to the delight of
hardcore comic kids. As a parody, it plays brilliantly. Its main cinematic
inspiration is Sam Raimi’s <em>Spiderman</em>, which stands out as the biggest
catalyst to our current heroically saturated film market. Pulling scenes,
musical themes, narration and set designs from Mr. Raimi’s take on the hero,
Mr. Vaughn is able to dance the line of homage and theft while building his
own original language for this film.</p>

<p>Aaron Johnson delivers a nerdy, yet adorable as the title character. He fills
Tobey Maguire’s spandex boots nicely. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who the
internet will never know by a name other than McLovin’, brings his endearing
brand of geekery to the screen. Even the most trivial of statements out of his
mouth had the Austin audience rolling in the aisles. Nicholas Cage, who spends
a lot of the film spoofing himself and the heroes on which his character is
based, provides some of his best comedic moments since <em>Face/Off</em>. Finally,
the young Chloe Moretz brings her potty mouth into the mix. Kids dropping
f-bombs always bring the yuks.</p>

<p><em>Kick-Ass</em>’s violence is wildly vivid, perhaps to a fault. The filmmakers have
gone above and beyond to deliver fast-paced action that warps your mind inside
out as you try to process what the hell just happened. When you think there’s
only one way to use a weapon, Mr. Vaughn and his creative team will take that
weapon, put a string on it and grab someone’s arm and make them shoot their
own face off. And the blood. Oh the blood. Heads explode, bludgeonings cause
splatter, and limbs fly every which way. To put it lightly, it is an indulgent
film.</p>

<p>That indulgence is really where the trouble lies. <em>Kick-Ass’_s audience is
extremely specific and, ironically, discerning. It is tough to please fandom,
but it is even harder to please the fans and everyone else at the same time.
When I say this doesn’t have an audience outside of Austin, I am speaking of
the proverbial Austin; the state of mind where fanaticism, gore and comedy
collide. This film delivers the laughs that the audience asked for, but how
refreshing it could be to give us something we didn’t expect, or at least
something that can be enjoyed by a bigger niche. I realize this is perhaps a
cynical take on a generally tight film. After all, it _does</em> deliver. You just
need to know what you’re getting into beforehand. Odds are, if you’re headed
to see the film, you’re hyper aware of what you’re being sold, in which case
you’re really going to love <em>Kick-Ass</em>.</p>

AMANDA-LOCKHART-300x237.jpg" alt="Erasing David Still, Photo Credit: Amanda
Lockhart" /></a>Wow, South by Southwest
(SXSW) is one helluva whirlwind event. Luckily, between screenings my schedule
allowed for a quick chat with David Bond, whose film <em>Erasing David</em> had its
U.S. Premiere here last night. The documentary, which the director concedes is
something of a sensationalist thriller, deals with the issue of modern privacy
in a world where we are obsessed with sharing so much of our personal
information.</p>

<p>In the film, David opts to “drop off the map” as it were. Two of the best
private investigators in the U.K. are given his picture and his name, but
nothing else. While the film crew follows them around, they must find David
who is doing everything in his power not to get caught. Within hours of them
beginning their assignment, they gather more information than he originally
thought was possible. They even started a fake Facebook account for David,
spoofing his friends into giving them leads to move forward on.</p>

<p>Lucky for us (or for me, really), the U.S. ranks much higher in terms of
privacy awareness than the U.K. Surprisingly, the U.K. is the third worst
country in terms of availability of private data in the world. Their
competition? China and Russia. This may seem startling, but the U.K. does have
CCTV cameras all over the country recording almost every public area. With
facial recognition technology slowly being integrated with the system, David
purports, it is only a matter of time before our social networks become meshed
with state infrastructure.</p>

<p>The fact that this film is receiving such a warm reception at a conference
such as SXSW says a lot about how much of a paranoid Luddite the director
<em>isn’t</em>. After all, the Interactive wing of SXSW is where Twitter and
Foursquare, a geo-location social network, were launched. All day long people
are sharing their location, their thoughts, and perhaps even more sensitive
data than they realize on their mobile phones as they wander about the Austin
Convention Center. But as I said, Mr. Bond is no Luddite. He is simply more
aware of these issues after his experience of making the film. It is his hope
that the film’s audience will be more aware as well.</p>

<p><em>Erasing David</em> will be screening again on Tuesday, March 16th at 11am in the
G-Tech theater. The film is also available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Erasing-David-SXSW-Festival-
Premiere/dp/B003AQEZGG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=digital-
video&amp;qid=1268524363&amp;sr=8-1">VOD through Amazon during the

content/uploads/2010/03/bjtaxi_print-300x200.jpg" alt="Still from Beijing Taxi" /></a>The other day, director Miao Wang
invited me to her Brooklyn home to discuss her new film, <em>Beijing Taxi</em>. The
documentary follows three Beijing cab drivers over the course of two years
leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. All working class locals, each
character offers a unique perspective on the society that has seemed closed
for so long to westerners. The film is an eye-opener for anyone who has ever
wanted to take a closer look at China’s capital, even, as Ms. Wang explains in
our interview, for the taxi drivers themselves. <em>Beijing Taxi</em> will have its
world premiere next week at SXSW in Austin, Texas. For more details, you can
visit the <a href="http://www.beijingtaxithefilm.com">film’s official website</a>. Listen
in as we discuss the current state of China, the making of the film, and what
bands Miao is most excited to hear when she heads to Austin for the festival.</p>
