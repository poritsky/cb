/Extract-movie-image-Jason-Bateman.jpg" alt="Extract Still" />As the explody, franchise-licious
summer wanes and awards-chasing fare creeps up on us, it is nice to know that
movies like <em>Extract</em> still get made amidst our modern state of Hollywood
sameness. Simple, funny and only lewd enough to make your grandma shudder,
Mike Judge’s new film is a formulaic comedy for the set who think they are
over formulaic comedy.</p>

<p>Jason Bateman, who in my opinion is often the saving grace of otherwise clunky
films (see: <em>Juno</em>, <em>The Kingdom</em>,
<em><a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/2008/08/07/review-hancock/">Hancock</a></em>; one can only
hope for <em>C__ouples Retreat</em>), plays Joel, a sexually frustrated owner of a
flavor extract manufacturing plant. Having invented a better way to make
concentrated flavors (the film’s eponymous extract), he has found a way to
turn a decent enough profit to get a big house, a fast car and a big TV for
his wife to watch while he wanks away in the bathroom. Seemingly idyllic,
everything from the annoying neighbor to his nagging employees make Joel long
for his bartending days, when life was simple.</p>

<p><em>Extract</em> is billed as something of a follow-up to Mr. Judge’s eminently
quotable 1999 <em>Office Space</em>, though a closer inspection reveals that it is
the exact opposite. Interestingly, both films are particularly poignant for
their respective decades. <em>Office Space</em> offered up laughs in many directions,
but none so bittersweet as those that criticised our society’s move to what
productivity gurus call “knowledge work”. This nefarious by-product of the
Silicon Valley revolution brought us into a world of meetings, reports,
networking and note-taking, all towards intangible ends. Take the character of
Milton Waddams, who spends the better part of the film looking for his
stapler; in a world in which you buy and sell nothing/knowledge, that physical
object became a source of pride.</p>

<p>Our current economic situation has signaled a return to the tangible (for
further reading, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24labor-t.html">Matthew B. Crawford wrote an eloquent
piece</a> for the New
York Times Magazine earlier this year stating as much) and so has Mike Judge.
In <em>Extract</em>, our hero is an inventor whose product can be held, touched and
put to use (albeit once vaporized). He is not Corporate America, he is Small
Business America. Of course, when the suits at General Mills come calling with
an offer to buy, he desires a piece of that corporate pie, but who wouldn’t?
As the deal of his dreams falls into place, an accident and a panhandled
lawsuit threaten to muck up the works, forming the overall conflict of the
film.</p>

<p>Coming along for the ride are a milquetoast (but shapely) Mila Kunis, a
comedically on-point Ben Affleck, and a surprising miss for Kristen Wiig. The
actress side-steps her usual tone of restrained cynicism to fill the role of a
quietly bitchy wife. In fairness, the script doesn’t offer her much in the way
of character depth, but there is something missing. Still a comedian, she
seems to be gravitating towards more legit acting fare; with some more time
I’m sure she will make the jump. Surprisingly, Mr. Affleck crackles. As a
barkeep/drug-pusher, every moment he is on screen is a moment to savor. Ms.
Kunis, on the other hand, is just fine, and I mean that in both the physically
affirmative and usefully indifferent sense. Any young thing could have filled
her flip flops.</p>

<p>In many ways, _Extract _is a film about that oft told American dream. the idea
that your personal ingenuity will raise you to the ranks of wealth and power.
The catch here is that with those implied bits of happiness come a truckload
of despair. The higher that Joel gets, the sadder his life becomes. There is a
very clear lesson here, drawing on Mr. Judge’s penchant for classical plot
conventions. (I should note that there is one evil little unresolved plot
point that should leave a bad taste in your mouth). The laughs aren’t constant
but they are consistent. What more do I need to ask for from a tight comedy
such as this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://cdn.sheknows.com/articles/julie-julia-amy-adams-knives.jpg" alt="" />A
cooking, blogging biopic is about the least interesting way I could imagine
spending a muggy summer afternoon. And yet, there I found myself, utterly
mystified by Nora Ephron’s Julie &amp; Julia, the story of two women who are
seemingly redeemed through the power of food alchemy. Featuring the second
delightful pairing of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci, the film is a phenomenal
take on the art of writing. In terms of scope, Ms. Ephron has pulled off a
monumental feet by taking the most boring thing in the world, sitting down and
putting pen to paper, mouse to blog, and pulling together a solid narrative
with thought-provoking implications.</p>

<p>Let’s start with those memorable performances. Mr. Tucci has long been
regarded as one of the finest (and fewest) character actors working today.
Consistently winning over our hearts with whatever minutes of screen-time he
can steal, the secret to his success is his embrace of being a bridesmaid,
never a bride. Here, he plays Paul Child the, loving, caring, pencil-thin
mustachioed husband to the as-yet famous Julia Child. That role is filled in
by Ms. Streep who crackles with energy. Long regarded as one of the finest
leading ladies in the biz, another dying breed, the actress seems to wish to
be demoted to the status Mr. Tucci enjoys. Her character work is ultimately
superb, in many ways out-sizing her front-and-center roles. Though she is
technically a lead here, I would argue that she is filling out a supporting
role with incredible finesse; Mrs. Child is ultimately a MacGuffin for the
modern blogger Julie Powell’s personal redemption.</p>

<p>We find our weathered hero, the aforementioned blogger who is played by Amy
Adams, making the move from Brooklyn to Queens in a city brought to it’s knees
after te attacks of September 11, 2001. Julie, a onetime proud member of the
Cobb salad eating literati, now finds herself answerig calls for the
buerecratic organization charged with rebuilding Lower Manhattan. Day in and
day out, she sits in er cubicle listening to the numerous sob stories that
befell New Yorkers in the wake of the attack. Food is her stress reliever. She
decries the mere fact that brownie batter will thicken every time she makes it
is a relief in a world where nothing is certain. The process, not the result,
is her redemption.</p>

<p>Enjoying the finer points of cooking isn’t quite enough for Julie, however.
She needs to break back into that crowd she once enjoyed membership in; she
needs to show up her skanky, yes skanky, blogging friend. And so an idea is
formed, obviously, to cook her way through Julia Child’s “Mastering the Art of
French Cooking” over the course of a year, blogging all the way. Meanwhile, in
the 1950s, Julia is struggling to find purpose in France where her husband is
employed and she is bored. Her search for meaning turns into the cook book in
question. And the wheel goes round!</p>

<p>As a blogger, I can attest to the film’s accuracies in the blogging space
(cyberspace, information superhighway for you real codgers out there). It’s
all there folks: the “me, me, me” problem, the wonder that is a good comments
system, the fear your boss will catch you in a lie, and most importantly the
unnatural connection between reader and writer. It can be very difficult to
put one’s finger on exactly what compels the daily blogger to stick to a game
that earns them zero cash. The film hits the nail on the head in this respect.
There is even a nod to the fact that the blogger’s printed counterpart, the
printed columnist, still wields a mighty sword (at least she did in 2002).</p>

<p>Where the film enters into some deliciously brainy noodling is in the
parallels between the times in which our title characters live. Both women
live in cities trying to put themselves back together after the ravages of
war. Both are afraid of Republicans. This has more to do, I assume, with Ms.
Ephron’s political leaning than anything else. For the Childs, the mighty hand
of the Republican comes crashing down in the form of Senator Joe McCarthy. For
Julie, there is a single line (“a Republican would fire you”) that shows us
her lefty-lean. I believe Ms. Ephron assumes her audience will see the jab at
President Bush and the Patriot Act, but this may fall flat in places other
than liberal hotbeds like New York. Nonetheless, the political subtext is
rampant in the film, though it hardly beats you over the head. Only eggs get
beaten in <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em>. (chortle)</p>

<p>Finally, the film is about the power that our imagination has to get us out of
even the most interminable of ruts. Late in the film, we learn that the “real”
Julia Child has learned of Julie’s blog and hates it. This rattles our
perception of the woman who gallivants about pretty ol’ Paris with a smile as
big as her sizable frame; of course it rattles Julie’s as well. As she comes
to terms with being hated by the hero who essentially handed her a career,
Julie realizes that the Julia in her mind is more important than the real one;
we reach the same conclusion. Julia and Paul Child as they appear in this film
are a myth. I don’t care if they are accurate to a T, the truth is that we
need legends, sometimes more than a real hero. I could go on and make the case
for the mythos that enveloped the nation in the months after the 9/11 attacks,
when the film takes place, but that is a completely different post.</p>

<p>As you may be able to tell from this near-thousand word post, <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em>
is a multi-faceted piece that has something for everyone. It is important to
note that this is far from a chick flick, and there is no rom-com aspect to
the film. Julie never gets her hair did to overcome loss; instead she is a
liberated woman who expresses her independence in the kitchen, feeding her
man.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.horrorphile.net/images/district-9-sharlto-copley1.jpg" alt="" />Though
Neill Blomkamp’s <em>District 9</em> evokes many of the classical elements of science
fiction films, the movie that kept coming back to me as I sat through the
disturbingly realistic pic was Melvin Van Peebles’ <em>Watermelon Man.</em> That 1970
film, which depicts a white racist waking up one day as a black man, hides a
poignant and timely message beneath the glimmering facade of a Hollywood
comedy. In much the same way, Mr. Blomkamp relies on familiar sci-fi
conventions to get to his many-layered message: if we are not alone in the
universe, do we deserve to know who shares it with us?</p>

<p>In an age when digital wizardry has opened up the floodgates to science-
fiction pics of all shapes and sizes, the genre seems to have become reliant
on the overall wow-factor, each film attempting to out-do the other in terms
of creature screentime. I remember a time when films would advertise how many
minutes more of digital special effects they had than <em>Jurassic Park</em>. (Brad
Silberling’s 1995 <em>Casper</em>, as in the friendly ghost, was particularly fond of
this statistic.) The main casualty of this shift has been the presence of a
theme and a message. Enter <em>District 9</em>.</p>

<p>Multi-National United (MNU) is a ubiquitous corporation charged with managing
the transfer of an alien race known as “prawns” from the makeshift “district
9” to the better controlled area known as “district 10”. Having landed for no
known reason two decades ago over Johannesburg, the prawns have become one of
the most marginalized group of refugees on the planet. MNU appears to be
taking on the impossible by dealing with the safe passage of the prawns, but
as you may have guessed, their intentions aren’t quite so pure. They are
aliens and they have huge freaking weapons which are linked to their DNA, only
a prawn can fire them. For twenty years, MNU has been trying to get a human to
fire one of these things. Their opportunity comes when Wikus Van De Merwe, a
high-level grunt at MNU, accidentally sprays space-goop in his face and grows
a prawn arm.</p>

<p>Wikus is a decidedly interesting character. He is a pencil pushing kook who
steals our hearts even when he is at his most fascist. His wide-eyed
explanations of prawn “population control”, in which a house full of fifty
eggs is torched while babies scream and pop, is absolutely endearing. With a
lump in your throat, there will still probably be a smile on your face. Just
like Jeff Gerber in <em>Watermelon Man</em>, before the accident he is a racist on
the extreme end of the spectrum, yet he displays such lively humanity that we
can only shake our heads in disappointment. The proper reaction should be to
grab a tire-iron and beat the shit out of him.</p>

<p>As his prawnification accelerates, MNU opts to vivisect Wikus in the name of
science, but he escapes to district 9 and meets one of the smarter prawns who
promises a way to turn him human again. Begin chase film. Stuff blows up and
stories get resolved; it’d be better if you just saw the movie than to explain
it all. In the end, you will probably have a bad tasted in your mouth. What is
so disturbing about <em>District 9</em> is that it is highly conceivable that
everything that occurs in the film would transpire given the opportunity. How
do we know? Because we have been doing this to our own kind for thousands of
years.</p>

<p>Johannesburg is the setting for the film, and I don’t care how many times Mr.
Blomkamp says this film isn’t about apartheid, it is. If they landed over
Portland, Oregon the narrative would be completely different. While <em>District
9</em> is a story about human shortcomings, not specifically South African, the
time and place of the film are decidedly significant. For one, the alien race
landed while apartheid was still an issue, perhaps their presence brought both
sides together against them. For most of the world, there is a question as to
what apartheid actually is. In essence, it is the marginalization and
dehumanization of an entire race of people. It goes a great deal deeper than
acts of violence or forcing someone to the back of a bus (not to minimize
American civil rights by any means). It is racism as policy, as a matter of
popular belief that seeps into every corner of society. We learn with Wikus
how deep that marginalization goes; if you don’t know what that looks like,
then perhaps <em>District 9</em> is worth a look. Stuff blows up a bunch and there’s
a ton of alien goop, so you won’t have to spend too much time learning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Apparently, Melvin Van Peebles’s _Confessionsofa Ex-Doofus ItchyFooted Mutha</em>
is opening this weekend at <a href="http://www.cinemavillage.com/chc/cv/show_movie.asp?movieid=1642">Cinema Village in
NYC</a>. I
caught the flick at Tribeca 2008 and, oh, what a scene it was. Originally
posted on the official <a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/2008/05/03/tribeca-2008-confessionsofa-ex-
doofus-itchyfooted-mutha/">Poritsky
Blog</a>, here is my original review/gut-reaction of this,
shall we say, interesting film._</p>

<p><a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/wp-

<p>it all week for leftovers.”</p>

<h4 id="melvin-van-peebles-after-the-premiere-of-his-2008-film-confessionsofa">-Melvin Van Peebles, after the premiere of his 2008 film “Confessionsofa</h4>
<p>Ex-Doofus Itchy-Footed Mutha”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I was sitting in a university auditorium that I was
suddenly rocketed back to my film school days while watching the latest film
“of” Melvin Van Peebles. Back then, I would have been sniggering through my
fingers as the raucous movie veered out of control around every single corner,
and when it was all over and the lights went up, I would have over-analyzed
the shit out of it and blatantly made fun of my colleague in class.</p>

<p>On its surface, “Confessionsofa Ex-Doofus-Itchyfooted Mutha” resembles the
worst of student film stereotypes, replete with sex, knives, confused editing
techniques, and above all, a message that it so convoluted and overdone that
it has gotten lost among the screen-pollution you witness while watching it.
That being said, I’m trying to figure out just why I loved this film.</p>

<p>The story goes like this. Mr. Van Peebles plays the lead role, one can never
quite grasp his name, as an old man coming to terms with his life. He sits
down in a dark and smoky room and begins his tale of woe for the captive
audience. The rest is the story of his life told through flashbacks. His
career in the merchant marine, his business venture with an addle-brained
cohort, his first and only love, his journey to find solace in the heart of
Africa and his subsequent escape from civil war there. All star the 75 year-
old Van Peebles at varying stages of life, and all seem to take place in the
same era, the current day. For example, you might see the elder filmmaker at
school talking to other kids, or running away from home with a tin of money he
had saved since he was born. No effort is made to dress up the sets to feel as
though they are in a particular period.</p>

<p>While it might help focus the audience if we could have a coherent picture of
this man’s history, Mr. Van Peebles’s formal choices, or lack thereof, help
drive his character home for us. In other words, to be distracted by the logic
that we do not see in this film is foolish. We receive just a clear a picture
of our leading man’s life with all the silliness of watching an old man act
like a child. It is clear who he is and why he has lived his life the way he
has. On top of all of that, as should be clear from the title, he is not a
trustworthy narrator. It is conceivable that his tales of intrigue and sexual
conquest are but a fabrication created to make it easier for him to sleep at
night.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ve yet made you aware of how silly this movie gets. Here are
some bullet points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While in the merchant marine, Mr. Van Peebles’s ship captain blows up a rival pirate ship (whose captain is played by the director’s son, Mario Van Peebles) and our hero is showered in gore. Grabbing arms as they land on him, he scratches his back and his crotch with the expected sound effects</li>
  <li>On the same voyage, he spends his leave time seducing little old ladies, making love to them and using their checkbooks</li>
  <li>In an effort to escape the clutches of a dictator in Africa, he runs through the jungle and is encountered by a randy gorilla, whose clutches he narrowly escapes only by pulling on its privates.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also expect the film to quickly rush into trippy effects around almost
every corner. The picture changes color constantly, there are countless image
overlays, and cartoon sound effects are used to hilarious effect throughout.
However, this just adds to the charm of the piece. We have become far too hung
up on plot in our cinema, so it is nice to see such an interesting (to say the
least!) character study.</p>

<p>When the book is closed on Melvin Van Peebles, he will unquestionably be
remembered by his 1971 independent hit “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song”.
Though he had made higher profile films before that one and has made quite a
few since, it is the film that is synonymous with his name and considered the
progenitor of the blaxploitation film movement. The incendiary film broke down
barriers and opened up opportunities for generations of black filmmakers.
Since the 1970s, however, this scruffy suspendered visionary has pulled back
from the mainstream. Left to his own devices, he has been making the films he
wants to make, for him. One must respect his audacity. If this film ever makes
it to DVD, I highly recommend you add it to your queue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The following analysis landed in my inbox this morning. Sunrise Tippeconnie, who recently shared his thoughts on</em> <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/07/31/funny-people-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-laughing-and-love-the-end/">Funny People</a> <em>with the candler blog, is a filmmaker and writer in Oklahoma City.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/inglourious-basterds-hickox-hammersmark.jpg" /></p>

<p>For me to respond to <em>Basterds</em>, I must first note my reaction of <em>Death Proof</em>, which over time feels more and more like it provides the most revelation about Tarantino and his relationship with the “cinema.” <em>Death Proof</em> describes a world where those that don’t fully comprehend the rules of “cinema” are eliminated (the women in the first half talk about high school movies, are surrounded by cinema clichés, but cannot make it to see the end of the film, while those with knowledge of film’s history and making survive through to “the end.” While Quentin the bartender, perhaps a more “true” image of Tarantino, is balanced out with a stumbling cinematic fake of a doppelganger in Stunt Man Mike, a character that perhaps doesn’t know the trade of filmmaking quite so well as his stunt women targets (and perhaps also fakes his film credits list in hopes of trapping his next victims, a deadly misstep of cinematic naivety in a rule-enforced genre). So, as <em>Death Proof</em> provides cinematic knowledge as survival, <em>Basterds</em> shows another side of the coin, the results of survival through cinema’s naivety: the “Propaganda Film”.</p>

<p>What is most interesting about this setup, is that Tarantino not only addresses that knowledge over cinema is limited, but that such knowledge does not eliminate the realities of the world, despite it’s perversely real effect. Each sequence of _Basterds _recalls quite familiar situations (some of which are, of course, of War and Spaghetti heritage, but also…) from his previous line of features, which I’m positive are the actual six “Basterds” of the title and are the real characters standing at the attention of Aldo Raine. And while we run through scenes we’ve seen before in any of the Tarantino’s oeuvre, our point of view has changed: instead of viewing the “Mexican standoff” from the point of view of the future parent (Beatrix Kiddo) as hero we look at it from the point of view of future parent as “enemy,” a Nazi.</p>

<p>When placed in this new vantage point, suddenly the Allies are not heroes when the father is shot –they have now made his young German son an orphan. Even if this orphan’s father was part of a violent political party, and Beatrix Kiddo was part of an assassination squad, their children were not willing participants in either world. This complicates the protagonist and their place in the “sides” in war, as well as the audience’s relationship with “sides” of narrative: Protagonist vs. Antagonist. What happens if both Protagonist and Antagonist ruthlessly engage in violence for their own cause, harming even those of a future generation that have no stakes in the games at hand.</p>

<p>This implies the actions of the all characters are wrong, no matter what “side” of the Propaganda they find themselves aligned. What happens if there is no one that is right? “The Shoe is on the other foot,” are the words of Nazi Colonel Landa, while sitting at the table of a captured Ally Aldo Raine, yet the approach towards violence is not different –both sides in this picture are out to harm when their needs are not met, and thus perhaps the shoe still fits the other foot. Violence is no good business for anyone in a tragedy, only those for whom business is “booming”, ie.: “cinema.” While we, as audience, initially wish for these characters to enact their rage and vengeance, the film elegantly reminds us such violence is not funny, but horrendous and comes from the real and scary realm of reality (perhaps Tarantino’s strongest directorial talent).</p>

<p>In the end, the final sequence is not just the narrative presentation of a violent Propaganda premiere, it absurdly (and satirically) glorifies what the “winning” characters parade as intolerant: violence through mass elimination. It is the violence that finds survival, and yet simultaneously also suggests a critical analysis (and perhaps a guilty apology) of Tarantino’s violent past. Not bad for a rehash.</p>

<p><div align="center">“Beeswax” director Andrew Bujalski getting a trim. Photo by Cheree Franco. Courtesy of The Cinema Guild.</div></p>

<p>Earlier this week I had the good pleasure of sitting down and chatting with director Andrew Bujalski about his new film, <em>Beeswax</em>. A very humble and quiet person, you’d never expect this kindly character to survive the rigors and torments of the filmmaking process. However, if you are familiar with his previous two films, <em>Funny Ha Ha</em> from 2002 and <em>Mutual Appreciation</em> from 2005, and especially in this new film which opens today, it would become immediately clear that this bespectacled, anxious young man is the perfect candidate to make movies that deal with such emotional introspection. In other words, it is the burden of filmmaking that creates his most evocative work.</p>

<p>I was immediately struck by how quickly our conversation would turn from discussing the characters in his films to talking about himself. It would seem that Bujalski and his creative work are woven together. <em>Beeswax</em> is a story of two twin sisters living in Austin, Texas, one of whom is the co-owner of a vintage clothing store. Jeannie, the wheel-chair bound (hardly bound is more like it) twin who runs the shop, learns early on that there is the possibility of a lawsuit coming from her business partner, Amanda, a close friend who has drifted away towards her fiancée.</p>

<p><strong>Does this legal dispute come from something in real life? Something close to you?</strong> It comes from fears that I have. What’s the nightmare version of a daydream? Knock wood, I’ve never been involved in a lawsuit like that. Every time I’ve ever signed a document, I get this terrible anxiety about it because if you look at the language of a contract, it’s not the way that human beings commuicate with one another. It’s written in this other language which is designed…You know, I just watched Nashville again recently and there’s a line where the Hal Phillip Walker trucker is driving around Nashville and he says “The Lord’s job is to do one of two things: to clarify and…” the only word that is coming to mind now is obfuscate. What’s the other word that means obfuscate? Anyway…</p>

<p><strong>I keep hearing the the phrase “legal thriller” being applied to this film.</strong> I’ll cop to responsibility on that.</p>

<p><strong>Does that work for you?</strong> It works better than other labels people have given me. You know, there’s something a little cheeky about presenting it that way because there are many obvious legal thriller beats that the movie does not hit. When I was writing it, it was certainly in my head, that was a kind of model I conceived of structuring the story. When I go to see those films, I don’t know what was the last one I saw, not just legal thrillers but political thrillers, these films where it’s all about building connections. Somebody is always talking about “well this evil corporation is in bed with this senator” and there’s so much shit that’s happened off screen in those movies. And it’s people trying to figure out what’s hapened off screen and make all the connections. You know that once you’ve made all the connections you’re going to uncover the ultimate evil thing. In a way, that resonates with our experiences to some extent. I think in daily life you find out that things connect in ways that you don’t understand.</p>

<p>Like most people I know, I was a huge fan of “The Wire”. It’s a great delight on “The Wire” to watch, to learn those connections and see how the city works. On a very personal level, I also felt like my life, my experience of life is not just about making the connections but is also about missed connections or incorrect connections. I mean the way that people learn to understand the world around them is not about learning to get it right and see the big picture. It’s about getting it wrong and seeing the little pictures.</p>

<p>For better or worse, I’m addicted to a kind of chaotic worldview in my work. This sort of was my version of a legal thriller. Also, anyone who has ever been in a lawsuit does not find it thrilling in the least.</p>

<p><strong>In Beeswax, adults, or parents, rather, have a power that the main characters don’t. Why?</strong> Part of that has to do with this concepton of who has the money. Certainly in my films the people ages 50 and up have the money. I think to some extent that everything I’ve done, although I don’t go into them thinking this way, has been this sort of fear of adulthood. It’s clearly kind of central to all of this stuff. Part of that is anxiety about money and what you have to do to get it and control it. I have such ambivalence about money and I guess I pass that on to my characters. I’m just rambling here because I don’t quite have an answer to your question.</p>

<p><strong>I relate to that. Some younger people might have a lot of money and lead very boring lives, while your characters have very interesting lives.</strong> Certainly it represents a kind of middle class perspective that I wouldn’t expect everybody who watches these movies to understand. It’s where I come from and It’s probably where a lot of people who watch these movies are going to come from. So many people I know, and maybe it’s just because I know a lot of people with “artistic temperaments” (his quotes),aren’t as financially secure as ur parents were at our age. And in other ways. I mean my folks were both in their mid-20s when they had me. They set about having stable careers and being responsible parents. I’ve obviously made very distinct choices. I want to make these films. I know that these films are not going to make me money, and I have no regrets about that. I’m kind of amazed by how much we have been able to get the films seen and it has meant everything in the world for me to be able to do these. There’s also some kind of anxiety about that. Why can’t I just be able to pay for things like my parents did. Why am I still sweating about being able to pay the rent? Aren’t I too old for this shit? I don’t know. A lot of that goes into the film. The adults do seem to be the people who have chosen to be “responsible” within society. But the kids are struggling to be there. If they want to be there or not. And I don’t know if I want to be there or not.</p>

<p><strong>I love that you know what I mean when I say adults even though the main characters are well into a adulthood.</strong> Yeah. That’s how I think of it now. Yeah, we’re all adults now, but people my parents’ age will always be adults, really.</p>

<p><strong>Would you want to make the jump to Hollywood?</strong> My experience so far has been that selling out is as much, if not more, work than doing what you believe in. What my films have done is they have gotten a certain amount of attention and established some level of credibility, or whatever. What they have not done is make money. If either of those films had grossed a million dollars, then I think selling out would be easier; it would be something that’s handed to you because people trust that the money is going to come back.</p>

<p>I knew going into _Beeswax _that I might be shooting myself in the foot here, career-wise. Which I kind of wanted to do. There was sort of a perverse aspect of choice in that. You know from a social perspective, from a business perspective. You know, there are people who care about the films and might want you to go make another personal film; people who love you personally and want you to do whatever you need to be happy. But most of the world wants you to go make money so that they can be involved and, maybe they can make some money too. And that’s great. But feeling that little bit of pressure, I started to feel that if everyone is expecting me to take it to the next level, then what happens if I don’t do that?</p>

<p>I hate the idea of calling card films. It’s fine and it often works out for people, but it’s also kind of sad when somebody does something that is a surprise hit, and then spend the next five, six or seven years of their lives stuck in Hollywood turnaround. Trying to get something else off the ground.</p>

<p><strong>While we talk about this the name that keeps coming to mind is David Gordon Green.</strong> Pineapple Express was a film that I looked at and thought “Well, shit, if I could do a studio movie and have it turn out that funny, that would be great.”</p>

<p><strong>All of your movies have been shot on film. Are you going to stick with film or are they any plans to move to video?</strong> ** **I don’t know. I don’t know. There’s so many things I don’t know. This is a question I’ve been answering since 2002 when we finished the first film. Since then, video has evolved so much and it will continue to evolve. It’s hard to put my finger on what video is. That’s one thing that I like about film. I always know what it is. It’s not like some film looks good and other film looks shitty. I mean, films can look shitty, but it’s not because the medium looks shitty. Video is just much harder to get handle on. Will they ever make video that’s a perfect simulacrum of film? Yeah. To some extent they already have. I don’t feel that comfortable with the technology yet. If you’re trying to get video to look exactly like film, it’s a silly thing to do. You might as well just go and shoot on film anyway if you’re using the super high-end stuff. Film just does something realy specific, and really beautiful to me. I just love it. It’s so much time making a film and there’s so much work, it’s unbelievable. To spend years on a film is such a pain, I want look at something that makes me happy with the images every day. I only have real limited experience working on video, but it doesn’t bring me the same joy in every image.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/sandlerfunnypeople.jpg" alt="" />Judd
Apatow’s third film, <em>Funny People</em>, is slow, disjointed, and riddled with
long breaks between laughs. It is also something close to an American comedy
masterpiece. I don’t mean that this is the funniest American film of all time,
far from it. <em>Funny People</em> is decidedly a film about people, but the “funny”
in the title is less apparent. Sure, the film is full of laughs, but few of
the characters are just plain ol’ silly. This calls into question our
preconceived definitions of comedy. What makes someone a comedian? What makes
the rest of us laugh?</p>

<p>Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a comedy megastar who tries to get back to
his stand up roots after learning he has a terminal illness. Hours after
learning of his impending doom, he bombs on open mic night. This spells
disaster for the young Ira Wright, played by Seth Rogen, who must follow the
dismal act. Ira is forced to face the cooled off crowd with his pile of low-
rent jokes, but a couple of cracks at George’s expense gets him noticed by the
celebrity, eventually landing him a gig as his personal assistant. Overnight
Ira goes from the least successful guy is his apartment of young talents to
the right hand man of their childhood hero.</p>

<p>Ira’s roomates, Leo Koenig and Mark Taylor Jackson (played by Jonah Hill and
Jason Schwartzman, respectively) embody the very definition of platonic love,
even though they spend the bulk of the movie violently ribbing their couch-
dwelling friend. It is obvious that when they all came to Hollywood, they
would stick with one another through the bitter end.</p>

<p>Adam Sandler is phenomenal in the lead role; this is truly the performance of
his career. His dramatic chops aren’t all that well refined. Try as he might,
Mr. Sandler never made the leap from comedy to drama as successfully as, say,
Tom Hanks. However, that is precisely what makes him so perfect in this role.
George is a man whose spirit has been dampened, beaten down over the years
until he only knew how to do one thing: make people laugh at any cost to his
pride or his interpersonal relationships. This comedic layer is why a funny
behemoth such as Mr. Sandler is required. Anyone could get George’s dramatic
overtones right, but a masterful laugh-maker is required to make the comedy
work. No one but Sandler could have brought that out as beautifully.</p>

<p>Close to the end of the film, after verbally berating Ira, George takes things
below the belt and suggests maybe the young comedian should find something
else to do with his life. “Comedy, usually, is for funny people.” It is a
massive moment. As audience members, we know how to laugh, but what separates
us from the comedians is knowing quite how to evoke that visceral reaction
from the masses. In plain English, Mr. Apatow’s film explicitly explains what
it is that separates the funny from the not, yet we remain as confused by this
dark art as we were before viewing <em>Funny People</em>. That we still laugh for two
and a half hours in this moving piece is evidence enough that we are willing
to put it on faith that these people are, in fact, quite funny.</p>

<p><em>Ed. Note: For a more in-depth critique of of _Funny People</em>, please read
Sunrise Tippeconnie’s posting, <em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/07/31/funny-

content/uploads/2009/08/Annex-Stewart-James-Harvey_04-744x1024.jpg" alt="Jimmy Stewart in Harvey" />Two days
ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/07/31/ridley-scott-to-return-to-
alien-big-whoop/">rection piece about Ridley Scott’s being named director for an
upcoming </a><em><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/07/31/ridley-scott-

alien-big-whoop/">
prequel</a>. Today, <a href="http://weblogs.variety.com/bfdealmemo/2009/08/spielberg-takes-
harvey-as-next-pic.html">Variety is reporting that Steven Spielberg has
chosen his next picture as
director</a>, an adaptation of the 1944 Mary Chase play, <em>Harvey</em>.
Most audiences will remember the story from the 1950 film of the same name
starring, quite memorably, Jimmy Stewart. So here we have next project
decisions from two towering cinema institutions: Spielberg and Scott. You
already know what I think about the whole <em>Alien</em> thing. What do I make of
this? Glad you asked.</p>

<p>Any IMDb troll worth his or her salt knows that following Mr. Spielberg’s next
film is a game so confusing and full of deceit that it is better to just sit
and wait for announcement such as this one. For example, his Abraham Lincoln
project has been in the works forever. I personally prefer it this way. For a
director as formidable as him, I’d rather not know what he has coming down the
pipe. It only adds to the whole “Spilebergian” mystique. But now we know the
next film.</p>

<p>The question that must be asked is does the world really need another
incarnation of <em>Harvey</em>? Probably not, but there also isn’t any reason why we
shouldn’t have one, right? We’re content to watch so many other remakes and
redos and reboots, what’s the big deal about one more? The biggest problem
with a director making the wrong choice is that he only has a limited amount
of years to make films; any missteps waste years in which better films could
be made. So who is to say that this is the right or wrong choice? Well, Mr.
Spielberg himself.</p>

<p>The biggest piece that I left out of the Ridley Scott article was that these
A-list directors are in a position to make whatever they want. Where younger
up and comers may get wedged into a particular project for the money or the
connections, an established director can think long and hard about the
projects he wants to take on. So while it is all well and good for us to
comment from the sidelines, we should also be at least excited that these
people see something in these projects that propels them into the director’s
chair. Why is Mr. Spielberg taking on <em>Harvey</em>? Why is Mr. Scott rejoining the
<em>Alien</em> franchise? Because they see something wonderful, and in time, that
vision will be shared with us.</p>

<p>All that being said, I feel totally secure sitting here on my tuffet, eating
my curds and whey, giving Spielberg the stink-eye (one eyebrow raised) and
saying “<em>Harvey</em>? Really? Uhhhhhhhh-reeeeally?” That’s what separates the two
of us. While I can blog my cynical thoughts away, he gets to wake up and make
whatever the hell he wants. Good for you Steve, just please don’t cast Tom
Hanks in the lead; your Frank Capra-Jimmy Stewart relationship has come far
enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006722.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1">Variety reported</a> that Ridley Scott is attached to an upcoming <em>Alien</em> prequel. I am a fan of both Mr. Scott and his groundbreaking 1979 space thriller, but I can’t help hiking up my crotchety old man pants and start telling it like it is. So here comes a finger-wagging rant; get ready.</p>

<p>The <em>Alien</em> franchise is one of the most interesting in film history (for the purposes of this article, I am excluding the <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> series of films from the franchise). It stands out mostly for the incredible list of alumni. James Cameron, who directed <em>Aliens</em>, went on to pioneer the art of digital special effects and make the most successful film of all time, <em>Titanic</em>. Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jeunet, already established for international hits <em>Delicatessen</em> and <em>City of Lost Children</em> by the time he made <em>Alien: Resurrection</em>, directed <em>Amélie</em> a few years after joining the franchise; that film became the biggest francophonic film outside of France ever. Mr. Scott’s brother in arms from the Propoganda Films days, David Fincher, first cut his teeth with <em>Alien3</em> in 1992, going on to make some of the most provocative thrillers since.</p>

<p>But it is Ridley who has always stood out as the most illustrious alum. The original <em>Alien</em> is a landmark film that took the world by surprise. It was a thriller set in space, not a sci-fi film that was thrilling. Three years later, Mr. Scott turned the sci-fi world on its side once again with <em>Blade Runner</em>. Essentially a film noir set in a bleak future cooked up by Phillip K. Dick, it remains the gold standard of futuristic cinema in the age of advanced special effects. Of course, sci-fi was only the beginning for him. In 1991, he received his first Oscar nomination for <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>, which again rattled the world for defying genre and moving us forward.</p>

<p>Like every filmmaker, Mr. Scott has grown up. Over the years, his films have garnered a huge audience. His 2000<em>Gladiator</em> took home Best Picture and reintroduced the classical epic to modern eyes. Just the same, <em>Black Hawk Down</em> reinvented the American military protags for a bloodthirsty and hero-deficient audience in the wake of the September 11th attacks in 2001. These films, while respectable, don’t evoke quite the same earth-shattering sensibilities as his earlier work. They feel more like the conventional studio pics he defied in his younger days, fitted to a formula that could statistically bring in an audience and get awards voters’ attention. When I say he has grown up, I mean it in the sense of Peter Pan; he will need some fairy dust to get back to his old self.</p>

<p>So any fanboy (or girl) who feels all tingly inside over the decision to bring Ridley Scott back into the <em>Alien</em> fold must consider his body of work over the last decade rather than his whole body of work. It has been thirty years since he made us realize that in space, no one can hear you scream. I don’t mean to minimize the extent of his work in recent years. In fact, his Scott Free shingle, which he shares with directing brother Tony, has produced some wonderful content of late.</p>

<p>My point here is that the logic behind bringing him back to the film may be exciting because of who he is now, but I am not interested in the fact that he started this whole thing so long ago. Perhaps bringing a fresh face to the series would create an even better film. To wit, would anyone have preferred Leonard Nimoy or Nicholas Meyer to have directed this summer’s <em>Star Trek</em>? Even better, couldn’t the last three <em>Star Wars</em> films have been enhanced by a director other than George Lucas in the same manner that Irvin Kershner brought a fresh eye to <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>? I’m not saying these rules always hold true. For example, look where Richard Lester and Sidney J. Furie took Richard Donner’s <em>Superman: The Movie</em> (the dumps, we can fight about it in another post if you like). On the other hand, could anyone imagine Mr. Donner stepping back in to that series in 2006? The guy who made <em>16 Blocks</em>?</p>

<p>In short, I am happy that, at least on paper, Mr. Scott will be returning to space, but I can’t find it in me to get all hot and bothered that he is doing so with the franchise that made him famous. While we obsess over these franchise reboots, I suppose I can take solace in the fact that a master like him will be joining in the fun. Who knows, maybe there’s a little 1979 Ridley hiding inside of him, just waiting for the right moment to blow us all away again. We’ll see.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/arts/photos/2009/07/30/arts-funny-
people-584.jpg" alt="" />There are three questions that immediately come up about this
picture. 1. Is it a “passing of the torch” film? 2. Is it film a masterpiece?
3. Is it funny?</p>

<p>Let’s answer the last question first. <em>Funny People</em> is exactly what the title
suggests, it is about people, and not about being funny. To be direct, the
film is funny but it is definitely not a [traditional] comedy. In fact the
concept of the film being a comedy (specifically a crossbreed of two
subgenres: the Adam Sandler and the Judd Apatow comedy) is a complex idea that
reaches into anthropologic study in the vein of the Hal Ashby’s <em>Being There</em>.
Sandler’s character George Simmons finds out in one of the first (and almost
rushed) scenes at blank range that he has cancer. Comedy and death immediately
call up another analysis of a comedic master: Chaplin in <em>Monsiuer Verdoux</em>
(and we all know how the audience loved that film, despite it’s ranking as a
masterpiece).</p>

<p>Yet, while the themes of death reign, Apatow’s analysis yields that being a
star in the Hollywood system provides no success in finding the “happy ending”
designed in any of the films actually made within it. In fact, any happy
ending that resides within <em>Funny People</em> is tragedy in disguise, which of
course is the true root of the finest comedy, and just happens to suggest that
any “torch-bearing” carries with it the false promises of infinity.</p>

<p>Just as the walls of the film are lined with creative greats from Jimi Hendrix
to Rodney Dangerfield, the time of these greats has passed and there will be
no other like them. This does not mean that there was any attempt at torch-
passing, there might just be someone whom believes that Lenny Kravitz is
reincarnation, but most of us do not, and Funny People says that is okay. In
fact the film, following the rules of a Sandler comedy, provides great
comedian cameos, although they function so much more eloquently: Paul Reiser’s
discussion of missed limelight over making his family laugh is no real
conflict for him at all, and that in fact reveals the great truth of any
Sandler film: life is the most important thing after family.</p>

<p>As Simmons struggles to comprehend the true worth of life, Seth Rogen’s
character, Ira Wright, is introduced to these ideas early in his attempts to
climb the star ladder so that he can find salvation before falling into the
star-fucker trap he sees in his idol Simmons. So to answer the first question:
Seth Rogen’s character Ira Wright does not like the choices he must make to
survive in the world of successful Hollywood stars, even though he is on the
verge of stardom himself. After the end of the film there is a good chance
that his character might walk away from the trappings of Hollywood success for
things that be believes in more: doing the right thing (which in the case of
any Sandler film is proving that solidification of family is more important
than any “success” implied by a “happy ending”).</p>

<p>Sandler walking away from this film with no one to carry on a legacy is a hard
thing to digest when everyone should be laughing and the set-up suggests such
a torch-passing. Cancer <em>is</em> on the mind, and it’s a slow death by show-
business. Any implications that someone is going to get laid in the film also
carries with it the strain of “star-fucker”, the strange compulsion that
copulation with someone famous brings you closer to something infinite. There
is literally nothing further than the truth, and every character in the film
searches for this physical equivalent for the infinite, when it only resides
in a connection that holds no potential for such a “star-fucker” relationship.
When the fragile state of Simmons’ and Wright’s friendship comes to terms with
the possibility of end, there is no struggle to maintain stardom and the
“happy ending” dreams of immortality.</p>

<p>Yet, the final implications of Apatow’s analysis suggests that comedy serves
not a as a device for escape from pain, but a constant reminder that these
pains are just as much a part of life as the joys that life can bring. Again,
the rules of a Sandler picture ring. If his picture can call both the pain and
joy to mind over the formalistic and historic properties of comedy (or film),
then any Sandler film is a masterpiece. [Of course it’s a little too late to
tell you that I am biased about question number two, since “Adam Sandler” is a
hero of mine because all his works remind me more about life than anything
else (again, like Chaplin). Sorry, question number two was no fair, since it
was a trick question.]</p>
