<p>Still, I’d like to see a new version of DVD Studio Pro (or Blu-ray Studio, or
Digital Studio) in the next Final Cut Studio update. I agree with everything
Marco is saying except he leaves out the phenomenal picture quality of Blu-

all these years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Conan O’Brien’s career has been well-documented both in the press and in New
York Times writer Bill Carter’s extensive (and fascinating) book, <em>The War for
Late Night</em>. Filmmaker Rodman Flender set out to flesh out his tale by
documenting the performer’s summer long live comedy tour while he was barred
from being on television. Save for a few salient moments, <em>Conan O’Brien Can’t
Stop</em> serves more as a peek at the show he performed and less of a character
study of one of the most fascinating late night stars in television. The
unprecedented access is squandered, showing us little more than the Conan we
already knew from TV.</p>

<p>The buzzword surrounding the film is “Mean Conan”, the unguarded version of
Conan that punches his writers, threatens to fire his assistant and can’t help
but waste his energy and voice for the opportunity to entertain adoring fans.
The trouble is that there’s no clear narrative to the documentary at all. You
basically come along for a ride on the tour bus through some forty-odd
performances. To be fair, it’s a pretty fun ride. I couldn’t stop laughing the
entire film.</p>

<p>My main problem is that the film doesn’t do much more than show us Conan on
the road. There is mention made of how he came to lose his gig at NBC, but it
skips over some of the more poignant points about his career turns over the
years (the entire backstory is told through a repurposed Taiwanese animation).
Very little is made of his career as a writer, or even of his time helming
NBC’s 12:35 block (though even money says this was a rights issue for that
footage). Those who know nothing of Conan’s professional travails will be lost
from the get-go, which is why it plays more like a circle-jerk for fans than
as a true narrative.</p>

<p>That’s not to say there aren’t some great scenes. In one instance, after a
show in New York City, Conan’s producer Jeff Ross tells him not to greet the
enormous group of fans behind a barricade outside his green room. “You don’t
get it, Jeff. I can’t just go home and read a fucking Kindle after a show. I
have to go out there.” It’s funny but it’s also a great insight on him as a
performer and a character.</p>

<p>Conan puts himself out there, warts and all, in this film. I only wish a
braver filmmaker had been behind the camera, or at the editing bay, to help
bring out a more human picture of him. I was expecting something along the
lines of <em>Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work</em>, which works both as a portrait and as
a comedy road film. <em>Conan O’Brien Can’t Stop</em> may have many great moments,
but the piece as a whole never comes together.</p>

<p>All that being said, it’s funny as hell and definitely worth a look,
especially if you’re a Conan fan. If you’re not, I think the Joan Rivers doc
is out on DVD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Greta Gerwig’s performance in Alison Bagnall’s <em>The Dish and the Spoon</em> proves
she is not just one of the best actresses of our time, but of any time. She
has the straightforward wit of Katherine Hepburn, the unflinching comedic
backbone of Lucille Ball, the mysterious grace of Meryl Streep…I could go
on. She is not the only phenomenal aspect of the film, but it’s worth being
said and said again: Gerwig is great and must finally be shared with the
entire moviegoing world.</p>

<p>In <em>Dish</em>, she plays Rose, a woman on the lam after her husband admits to
cheating on her. It’s clear Rose has been closely guarded her whole life,
rarely having to fend for herself as she does on her week-long wander through
a Delaware beach town in winter. While trying to find drunken solace in
lighthouse, she happens up a wayward British boy, played by Olly Alexander,
whom she fears is ill. After lugging his sleeping body into her car, he
refuses her offer to take him to the hospital and the two become fast, if
awkward, friends.</p>

<p>What ensues are a series of beautiful moments which inform each characters’
back story and emotional makeup. Bagnall masterfully makes use of her actors
in <em>Dish</em>. In the film’s culmination, a colonial dance that ends in a violent
confrontation, the director holds back, utilizing the space of the dance
studio to build up to a moment of realization. It is a time bomb that only we
are privy to, and when it goes off, it is beautiful, painful.</p>

<p>I can’t recommend <em>The Dish and the Spoon</em> highly enough. Gerwig, who had a
lead role in Noah Baumbach’s 2010 <em>Greenberg</em> is about to reach her widest
audience alongside Russell Brand in the upcoming <em>Arthur</em>. Hopefully, that
will lead people back to <em>The Dish and the Spoon</em> so they can see what she is
capable of when let loose on an interesting character.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Behind the Music” meets “Intervention” in Keirda Bahruth’s phenomenal
documentary <em>Bob and the Monster</em>. It tells the story of Bob Forrest, onetime
frontman for L.A. post-punk mainstay Thelonious Monster, whose experiences as
a drug addict have led him to become an addiction counselor. Bahruth
masterfully uses archival footage, home movies, photographs, staged sequences
and animation to tell the epic tale that is Forrest’s life.</p>

<p>The story is one you’ve heard a million times. A rock star from humble
beginnings falls into a pile of csh and blows it on heroin and other drugs,
eventually bottoming out and either dying or living a meager existence. What
sets Forrest’s tale apart is how he has come to recognize why he was doing
drugs and why the addiction landscape has changed so much in the past few
decades. He explains it best by admitting he once thought Charles Bukowski
would have been nothing without alcohol, but the truth is that he would still
have been Charles Bukowski.</p>

<p>Forrest’s life story, outside of his dealings in addiction, is fascinating
enough. I don’t want to give too much of it away, but his childhood experience
was mostly ideal, until it wasn’t, and that’s about when he fell into drugs.
This point comes out organically and after we have already come to understand
who he is as a person.</p>

<p>The film briefly goes into the issues of clinical addiction, the concept that
drugs will help you kick drugs. Forrest quips that if someone comes to him on
a prescription addiction drug, he tells them to go back on heroin for a month
because it’s easier to get them to kick it. Unconventional, sure, but Forrest
rails against the addiction treatment industry. At the film’s conclusion, he
opens his own clinic where he can use the new methods he has studied. Dr. Drew
Pinsky, a recurring character in the film, serves as a consultant to the
practice.</p>

<p>Bahruth spent over 6 years making <em>Bob and the Monster</em> and her passion shines
through in every frame. It is a lovely character study, but it is also a rock-
doc. It is touching, funny and full of some great music. If it ever comes to
your town, it is absolutely worth a look or two.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Summit Entertainment complained that a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/12/the-source-code/">TechCrunch
article</a> on <em>Source Code</em>
was too snarky, a publicity liaison for Moviefone conveyed the message of the
studio’s displeasure to the article’s author. She then proceeded to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/15/snarketing/">post the
email request online</a> and ball
out Moviefone and AOL for dictating editorial to TechCrunch at a studio’s
behest. Then <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/03/15
/moviefones-response-to-the-techcrunch-post/">Moviefone responded</a> with a post that didn’t help
their case all that much. It’s a very sticky situation, and many parties
screwed up here. Let’s take a look at who screwed up what.</p>

<h2 id="summit-entertainment">Summit Entertainment</h2>

<p>Summit should never have asked for an article to be changed. However, I work
with publicists all the time and this is par for the course. They put critics
and writers on the spot all the time. They are not journalists. From the
perspective of a publicity company, the press is simply a marketing outlet, a
place to get their client’s name in print to help sell tickets. It’s taking it
too far to say they have no ethics, but they are certainly not bound to any
ethical code as journalists are (or are supposed to be). So while I find their
action here reprehensible, there is no real recourse. Should Summit have
requested the article to be changed? Nope. Can I fault them for trying? Nope.
Their’s is a dirty business and it’s up to us to keep our business clean.</p>

<h2 id="unnamed-moviefone-liaison">Unnamed Moviefone Liaison</h2>

<p>If there is a patient zero or smoking gun in this mess, this person is it.
Parsing out the e-mail he or she sent, the language is actually extremely
careful. They’re not telling the writer to change the piece, they’re politely
asking if they would consider changing it. This is what Moviefone is using as
its defense of this person’s actions. TechCrunch is claiming that AOL is
dictating editorial to them through Moviefone, but since this person wasn’t
working in an editorial capacity everything is kosher, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. No one at any outlet should be looking out for a studio’s best
interests. It was out of line to suggest that TechCrunch take any action on
the post whatsoever. There are a few ways to respond to Summit in this
situation. You could flat out say “no way”; you could lie and just not convey
the message; or you could direct them to TechCrunch’s equivalent liaison. Had
that happened, we’d never have heard of this.</p>

<h2 id="techcrunch-writer-alexia-tsotsis">TechCrunch Writer Alexia Tsotsis</h2>

<p>In Alexia Tsotsis’s post, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/15/snarketing/">AOL Asks Us If We Can Tone It
Down</a>, she splits hairs by
linking Moviefone and AOL so directly. She has every right to be pissed by
that e-mail, but citing the unwritten arrangement that if AOL ever steps on
TechCrunch’s editorial toes they would publish any such correspondence doesn’t
make a lot of sense. Moviefone does not act as an overlord of TechCrunch, and
in fact they are closer to being on the same level in AOL’s family. This could
have been dealt with internally. Someone screwed up (see above), but that
didn’t necessarily have to result in the loss of credibility of an entire film
site. The post’s headline is patently false and Alexia knows it. TechCrunch
loves to fear-monger if it results in clicks, but this should have been an
exception. AOL didn’t ask them to change anything.</p>

<h2 id="moviefones-official-response-by-patricia-chui">Moviefone’s Official Response by Patricia Chui</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/03/15
/moviefones-response-to-the-techcrunch-post/">Pure, unadulterated horse-shit</a>. Here’s the steamiest bit
(boldface hers):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reality of our situation is that, as a movies site, we work with movie
studios every day, and it is in our best interests to stay on good terms with
them. Staying on good terms with studios means that we will relay information
if asked. <strong>It does not mean that we would ever force a writer or an editor to
edit their work for the sake of a studio – or anyone else.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe Patricia’s conviction in that last sentence, and as she points out
earlier in the piece, technically, no one was telling Alexia to change her
copy. But that’s splitting hairs. I’m more concerned with the bit about the
reality of Moviefone’s situation, about staying on good terms with studios. No
embargoes were breached, no arrangements upended. I can’t imagine how not
conveying this message would have injured the site’s relationship with Summit.
Moreover, her case is basically that keeping a relationship with Summit is
more important than journalistic integrity. It’s a dopey statement to make at
best. If it were a smaller film site perhaps no one would be surprised, but
given the size of Moviefone’s audience, it sounds weird to think they would
need to bend over backwards to keep a single studio in their Rolodex.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This all really comes down to the balance of journalism versus publicity, or
as Alexia Tsotsis would put it, Silicon Valley versus Hollywood. What
Moviefone forgot in this situation is that there is a balance of power between
the press and the movie studios. They may have the access to screenings and
movie stars, but we have the audience they want. We don’t have to bend to them
for anything because we <em>don’t</em> have to stay on good terms with the movie
studios any more than they have to stay on good terms with us. It’s a mutually
beneficial relationship.</p>

<p>It’s funny that this went down not 24 hours after I attended a panel at SXSW
called “The Blogger Centipede: How Content is Eroding Credibility”. The room
was full of elite film journalists (including current and now former Moviefone
writers) all discussing plagiarism and credibility in the blog age. Towards
the end of the session, the conversation moved to some of these issues,
specifically dealing with publicists who are using you for good clips. It took
almost no time for a situation to present itself which illustrates, at least,
how not to go about working as a film journalist.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At last year’s SXSW, one of the films that stuck with me was Aaron Katz’s
<em>Cold Weather</em>, a mumblecore whodunnit that took the “genre”, if you can call
it that, to a new level. This year, the film that elevates the form is without
a doubt Evan Glodell’s <em>Bellflower</em>, a post-apocalyptic (or is it?) love story
(or is it?). It’s the story of two guys, Woodrow (Glodell) and Aiden (Tyler
Dawson), who like to mod cars and are working on a flame thrower, just in case
a <em>Mad Max</em>-esque apocalypse comes.</p>

<p>When Woodrow falls for Millie (Jessie Wiseman) in a cricket eating contest,
the two set up a date which leads to a road trip on a whim from California
(home of the street which gives the film its name) to Texas. It is the genesis
of something beautiful, something pure: inexplicable love. The first half of
the film is all about how a relationship can begin; how simple and stupid love
can be.</p>

<p>The second half of the film is all about how a relationship can devolve into a
steaming mess, and how wrenching love lost can be on the soul. That’s reading
between the lines of the experience of the film, which is a jaunty, at times
heart-pounding, trip. All of the main characters experience some kind of
physical debilitation, all because of our femme fatale’s unfaithfulness. It is
a pleasure to behold the dark and disturbing places Glodell takes the
characters once they try to exist in a loveless world.</p>

<p>Formally, <em>Bellflower</em> is a gritty, lo-fi endeavor. There is use of plastic-
looking lenses, tilt-shifts lenses, a sheen of unmoving glass against the
frame and bits of dirt and hair sitting statically between you and the film on
screen. None of the effects are throwback looks, but aberrations of modern
digital filmmaking. The dirt, for example, would be more organic if it were
shot on film, moving and jumping around the frame. There is also an
inconsistency to the lo-fi-ness. Sometimes it is a clearly applied effect,
sometimes it really looks like it was shot poorly. The highlights are
constantly blown out in the film. This too is a problem that is digital-
specific.</p>

<p>These image choices bothered me at first, until the film changes directions
and rears its post-love, post-apocalypse head. The style becomes more
motivated with time, and now has me reevaluating the first half of the film,
back when things were still all well and good.</p>

<p>In mainstream films, genre cinema has become refined into a science. There was
a time, like back when <em>Mad Max</em> (which is constantly referenced throughout
the film) was released that you could make a genre film and still say
something, still offer more than what’s on the surface. Glodell has taken one
of the most popular forms of American indie cinema (mumblecore) and flipped it
into an action film that says something about our emotions, about how we
experience the highs and lows of the simple things in life. Everything here is
implausible, including two hipsters’ obsession with fire and cars, yet it
works perfectly.</p>

<p>Glodell is great as the tortured Woodrow, but for me, the real treat to watch
was Tyler Dawson’s Aiden. To be fair, Aiden is more of a badass and less of a
softie than Woodrow, thus the more fun character to play. Still, Dawson takes
the character to unexpected places. He is a not just a best friend, he is
<em>the</em> best friend, the one we all wish we had in our court. I think he has
chops to enjoy a healthy career in movies, and I can’t wait to see what other
roles he takes on.</p>

<p>There is a debate (at least amongst myself and a friend I saw the film with)
about which aspects of the film are real and which are fantasy. Perhaps none
of it is fantasy, and perhaps none of it is real. It’s difficult to tell, but
not as a fault to the film. <em>Bellflower</em> is a movie that, if nothing else,
will surprise audiences. It will inspire endless conversation on the ride
home. For a small indie film about twenty-somethings falling in and out of
love, that’s a hell of a feat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though it’s been around since last year’s Sundance, <em>Hesher</em> is finally coming
to theaters with its first push to the public here at SXSW. Good thing it’s
coming now, because there was almost a shortage of Natalie Portman films in
the pipe. It’s a pretty good film, though perhaps hard to describe. I’ll go
with a cross between <em>E.T</em>, <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em> and <em>One Flew Over the
Cuckoo’s Nest</em>. Which is to say it’s about a lost boy who meets a nutcase
which changes his relationship with his father.</p>

<p>Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a badass squatter with a middle finger tattoo
on his back who likes to blow shit up. When T.J. (Devin Brochu), a depressed
middle-schooler with a propensity for incurring injury, accidentally loses
Hesher a sweet hideout, the metal-head wanderer decides to squat in T.J.’S
house with his father and grandmother.</p>

<p>After the death of his wife, T.J.’S father Paul (Rainn Wilson) falls into a
debilitating depression which causes his mother (Piper Laurie) to move in and
help out around the house. Hesher walks into this broken home not only for the
free roof and food but also, apparently, to fix it. He is someone who knows
broken families (it’s unclear how long he has been a homeless child) and makes
it his mission to ensure T.J. Won’t go through life the same way he did. Of
course, he’s rough around the edges so this all has to be inferred while he is
setting fire to a bully’s car or tossing a cherry bomb at a cop car or sucking
on a tall boy at a funeral.</p>

<p>Hesher is a complex role, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt takes on the task with
everything he’s got. There is no reason to love him but somehow, Gordon-Levitt
makes it possible. He keeps his eyes sympathetic even as he chortles through
low-level terrorism. Also taking a nice dramatic turn is Rainn Wilson, who,
just like his office co-star John Krasinkski did in <em>Away We Go</em>, dons a
mighty beard, a sign of his darkness and adultness, to play Paul. He goes to
great lengths to not be funny in <em>Hesher</em>, and it plays wonderfully. It’s
doing exactly what he needs for his career: proving he has a range.</p>

<p>Also present is Natalie Portman, who hearkens back to her <em>Garden State</em>
quirkiness as Nicole, the frumpy-hipster-hot grocery store clerk who serves as
T.J.’s inappropriate love interest/muse. It’s a refreshing role for Portman.
Unlike her starring role in <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/02/02/review-the-other-woman/"><em>The Other
Woman</em></a> she
actually fits in Nicole’s shoes. It’s weird; she is a glamorous movie star and
yet it’s the simpler, smaller roles that she fleshes out more successfully.</p>

<p>All told, <em>Hesher</em> is a very good film. Hesher himself is full of surprises;
he’s a great character to watch unfurl, or come undone is a better way of
putting it. The problem is in the ending. everything gets tied up predictably
and, for lack of a better term, cutesy-wutesy. The last 15 minutes are no
decent payoff for the characters we’ve gotten close to throughout the film.
Slow-mo musical reveal? Yep, you betcha. Amer-indie cinema is a form all its
own, and it’s getting stale with time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my best worst viewing experiences in recent years was when I saw
<em>Vantage Point</em> at about 10am at an Upper East Side multiplex. Every time the
story re-unfolded, the audience let loose a tortured groan. That film was
terrible but the lesson was clear: telling the same story over and over again
is not for the faint of heart; this is why Akira Kurosawa gets to be called a
master for making <em>Rashomon</em>, or Harold Ramis for <em>Groundhog Day</em>.</p>

<p>Duncan Jones is no Kurosawa (or Ramis, for that matter), but his newest film,
<em>Source Code</em>, is an enjoyable enough sci-fi thriller about a man reliving the
same eight minutes over and over in order to solve a crime. Jake Gyllenhaal
fills the role of Colter Stevens, a marine who wakes up strapped into a chair
after experiencing a vivid simulation on a train. With only a female officer
on a television screen to guide him (played by Vera Farmiga), he is both
trying to solve the mystery of his own whereabouts as well as discover who
bombed a Chicago-bound train that morning.</p>

<p>Using an experimental program called, unsurprisingly (and lamely, if you ask
me), Source Code, military scientists have found a way to thread Stevens’s DNA
with that of one of the victims of the attack. Jeffrey Wright plays the token
holier-than-though-military-slash-mad-scientist who exposits the science
behind Source Code. Without giving much away, the brain is capable of
retaining roughly eight minutes worth of memory from the moments just before
death. By mapping those 8 minutes onto Stevens’s brain, he can relive the
experience of being on the train, thus being able to find the bomber.</p>

<p>Jones gives us a lot to swallow at once, and there is no question that his
first priority was building a thoroughly fleshed out character for Gyllenhaal
to settle into. He is at once a roughneck on a tear and a softie looking for
love. It’s a lot of humanity for a man who can break another’s jaw in a single
punch.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <em>Source Code’s</em> weakest thread is as a thriller. The train
sequences are built to draw the audience in and establish a familiarity with
the space, but the premise is fodder for a brilliant whodunnit. So much time
is spent trying to explain away Stevens’s situation that the bomb plot plays
out a little too mathematically. This film is begging for more action and less
explanation. To be fair, however, the bomb plot is a MacGuffin.</p>

<p>I will say that by the end of the film I was completely sold on the idea of
the Source Code program. The concept has the makings of a nice little
franchise, if not of movies than certainly of comic books. That, it must be
said, is no small feat. Perhaps I’m clouded by the fact that <em>Source Code</em> is
basically a mash-up of <em>Unstoppable</em> and <em>Deja-Vu</em>, but part of me wishes
Duncan Jones had taken some action lessons from Tony Scott. The emotional arc
is finely tuned, but as an action film overall it falls short of thrilling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You’re looking at the third iteration of the candler blog. For those who have
never been here before, welcome; to those who have come and gone over the
years, welcome again. A lot has changed since I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/03/23/welcome-to-the-candler-
blog/">started the candler blog two
years ago</a>. I’d like to fill you in and let you know where I see things going in
the future, as well as explain the choices behind this new design.</p>

<h2 id="still-candling-but-where">Still Candling, But Where?</h2>

<p>Almost exactly one year ago, I attended an Oscar party thrown by Heeb
Magazine. I met one of their editors and let slip that I was headed to SXSW, a
trip paid out of pocket to cover for the candler blog. “You’re headed to
South-by? Great, wanna get us 3 reviews? Cool.” And that was it. Without any
idea of how to deliver on the request (what films, how long, deadline?) I
became a writer for Heeb.</p>

<p>I continued to contribute through the summer until the print magazine
officially folded. When Heeb moved online only in August, it was announced
that I would be the new Arts Editor, and I have fulfilled that role ever
since. The main reason I have written less on the candler blog is because of
my time taken up at <a href="http://www.heebmagazine.com">Heeb</a>. I also contribute
regularly at <a href="http://www.toromagazine.com">Toro Magazine</a> and
<a href="http://www.nachosny.com">NachosNY</a>. For a while, I was writing a few DVD
reviews at the <a href="http://guru.greencine.com/">GreenCine Guru</a> blog, but I
haven’t contributed one in quite some time.</p>

<p>My top priority with the new design was finding a way to make all of the other
content I publish elsewhere could find a home on the candler blog. Also, there
are a number of posts that others write which would be of interest to the
candler audience, but I’ve never had a way to quickly link to those pieces
here. Now, I can.</p>

<h2 id="think-out-with-your-link-out-updated-3-22-11">Think Out with your Link Out (UPDATED 3-22-11)</h2>

<p>I’m taking a cue from John Gruber’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring
Fireball</a> (and the many who have taken the cue from
him) and making some of my links lead to places other than the candler blog.
Any time you see a right-facing double arrow (⇒) at the end of a post
headline, either on the site or in the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/feed">RSS
feed</a>, clicking the headline will send you
out to another site. I imagine this will usually be used for my own work on
other sites, but I will also try to curate some links and offer my own
opinion.</p>

<p>With this move came the decision to remove ads from the site, at least for
now. I never liked the way my ads looked and they never did much but get in
the way. The most important thing now is content, and I don’t want anything to
get in the way of it. Will there be ads on the candler blog again one day? Who
knows.</p>

<h2 id="grid-vs-ego">Grid vs. Ego</h2>

<p>The new site design is based on Tom O’Doherty’s
<a href="http://www.snoother.com/extricate/">Extricate</a> Wordpress theme. I knew I
wanted to get something griddy for the new design and Extricate fits the bill
beautifully. It’s important to me that the actual text be allowed to shine
with the new design. I encourage readers to use services like
<a href="http://www.readability.com/">Readability</a> or
<a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to take candler blog content with
them and format to their heart’s content. I’ve added Readability’s button to
all of my posts so that readers can reformat the text as they please. It’s
free to use live on the site, and if you’re a Readability subscriber then
clicking “Read Later” will put a bit of money in my pocket. This is the way I
prefer to read and I’m sure others do too. Of course, if you want to stay on
the site, I think the text looks beautiful as it is.</p>

<p>I’m going to use images less, and instead keep either a poster or a small
photo of a film to the left of the content. Images have never looked that good
in the RSS feed, an issue that could of course be corrected through some
coding. However, I really want to focus on the written content on the site,
and some parity between what you get here and what you get in the feed is a
good thing in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="it-never-endsjust-you">It Never Ends/Just You?</h2>

<p>The redesign is ongoing, and given that this is my third major redesign in 2
years, you can guess that another may be around the corner. Who knows? Not me.</p>

<p>Speaking of me…for a long time I’ve purported egalitarian approach to the
candler blog. The plan was to build an outlet where anyone could contribute.
That didn’t pan out, though there has been one regular contributor alongside
myself, Sunrise Tippeconnie. He is sticking around and others are encouraged
to contribute, but at this point there’s no use hiding the fact that I’m in
control of the backend.</p>

<p>So that’s about it. I’d love to hear what you think of the new design in the
comments. Please come back early and often to see what’s happening at the
candler blog.</p>
