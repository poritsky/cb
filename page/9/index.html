  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/03/gravity.jpg" title="Sandra Bullock in Gravity" /></p>

<p>When <em>Gravity</em> took home awards for both cinematography (to Emmanuel Lubezki) and visual effects (to Timothy Webber, Chris Lawrence David Shirk and Neil Corbould) at the Oscars this past weekend, it got me thinking about the relationship between these two intertwined art forms. One can’t do most (though soon I would modify that to some) effects work without a camera, and, increasingly, one can’t shoot a film without the help of a skilled effects team. Are cinematography and visual effects actually that separate anymore?</p>

<p>So I poked around the old <a href="http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp">Oscar database</a>. Here are all of the films ever to win an Oscar for both cinematography<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and visual effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Gravity</em> (2013)</li>
  <li><em>Life of Pi</em> (2012)</li>
  <li><em>Hugo</em> (2011)</li>
  <li><em>Inception</em> (2010)</li>
  <li><em>Avatar</em> (2009)</li>
  <li><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em> (2001)</li>
  <li><em>Titanic</em> (1997)</li>
  <li><em>The Longest Day</em> (1962)</li>
  <li><em>Ben-Hur</em> (1959)</li>
  <li><em>The Thief of Bagdad</em> (1940)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ten films. Five of them in the last five years. This, to me, looks like a trend.</p>

<p>According to the Academy’s current bylaws, cinematography <a href="http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule08.html">isn’t narrowly defined</a>. Visual effects, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule22.html">are</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Achievements shall be judged within the parameters defined by the executive committee and on the basis of:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>a. consideration of the contribution the visual effects make to the overall production and</p>

    <p>b. the artistry, skill and fidelity with which the visual illusions are achieved.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>And later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visual effects, as an achievement or a craft, shall be determined by the Visual Effects Branch Executive Committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No such dictum is directed at the Cinematographers Branch. Cinematography is just…cinematography.</p>

<p>I think it’s becoming clear that we <em>should</em> be questioning what is and what isn’t considered cinematography. In the case of <em>Gravity</em>, a film whose illusion is so closely tied to its plot, it’s fair to ask how much of that movie magic comes from the camera, how much comes from special effects. Would it even be possible to award one and not the other? How could Lubezki’s camera work possibly hold up without the stunning work of the effects team?</p>

<p>Another question: why not make animated features eligible in the cinematography category? Regardless of how, technologically, a film is animated, there is always a “camera” that has to be positioned, moved and controlled. As visual effects and cinematography coalesce, why shouldn’t animation and cinematography as well?  </p>

<p>For good measure, here’s how the Academy <a href="http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule07.html">defines an animated feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters’ performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique. Motion capture by itself is not an animation technique. In addition, a significant number of the major characters must be animated, and animation must figure in no less than 75 percent of the picture’s running time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good definition for now, but it will soon become more difficult to make the distinction between effects-laden work and an animated film. As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> shrinks, our perception of “what is filmmaking?” will only get broader. Perhaps the Academy’s definitions should broaden as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/02/dbc-still.jpg" title="Dallas Buyers Club Still" /></p>

<p>So far I’ve done a terrible job <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2014/01/16/86th-academy-awards-master-viewing-list/">catching up</a> on all of the Oscar-nominated films.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> No matter; it’s crunch time now so I’m catching up where I can.</p>

<p>I picked up a Blu-ray of Jean-Marc Vallée’s <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em> at the video store last night to close the gap on the Best Picture category (I’ve only not seen <em>Philomena</em> and <em>12 Years a Slave</em>). My knee-jerk reaction <a href="http://letterboxd.com/poritsky/film/dallas-buyers-club/">on Letterboxd</a> last night<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> was that it was “sloppy.” In a nut, this film is two stellar performances wading through a disjointed narrative.</p>

<p>Much has been made of Matthew McConaughey’s recent spate of brilliant choices. From <em>Bernie</em> to <em>Magic Mike</em> to <em>True Detective</em> to this one, he’s been taking on increasingly complex roles and delivering great performance after great performance. His (and costar Jared Leto’s) most ballyhooed choice has been his weight fluctuation, winnowing his body away to almost nothing to play AIDS patient Ron Woodroof in <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em>. (It should be noted that fellow nominee Christian Bale went in exactly the opposite direction, putting on poundage for <em>American Hustle</em>.)</p>

<p>The physical transformations actors go through may be impressive, but they are beside the point once the camera rolls. McConaughey’s talent comes from a place deep down inside, an actorly spark that cannot be taught. It’s incredible how many Texans one man can play without any (or minimal) overlap; each character is his own man, easily distinguishable from the others. His Woodroof is far more complex than the story lets on, though I <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2014/02/richard-brodys-oscar-picks.html">agree with Richard Brody</a>: McConaughey’s brief appearance in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> far outstrips what he does here.</p>

<p>Leto manages to go toe-to-toe with McConaughey as Rayon, the transgender woman who goes into business with Woodroof selling unapproved drugs to suffering HIV patients. Rayon is a tortured character; she feels duty-bound to the maligned gay community (left to die while the FDA drags its feet approving new treatments) yet is also driven to keep up a nasty drug habit. She is capable of pulling off the impossible: tempering Woodroof’s intolerance. It’s not hard to see why. Leto imbues Rayon with so much humanity. She is tragically flawed and yet finds a way to keep going each and every day in the face of certain death. Woodroof finds a kindred spirit in her.</p>

<p>Narratively, <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em> is a mess. Director Vallée along with writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack do a good job of composing scenes that bring to the screen a specific time, place and crisis that I don’t think is often told. The AIDS crisis, in film, so often feels like a New York City (or at least North Atlantic, as in <em>Philadelphia</em>) scourge. Moving that narrative to another part of America, looking at it in the micro, is powerful stuff. Nonetheless the story barely holds together as the film progresses. We bounce from scene to scene as the story circles around. Woodroof hustles drugs, they dry up, he gets more, the feds close in, he fixes it, more trouble, he fixes it, and on and on. There are too many little conflicts that do little to inform us about these characters’ wants and needs. The story just keeps going and going until it’s over. And when the film does end I’m left to wonder what was gained, what was revealed?</p>

<p>One of my favorite, fleeting moments cuts down to Woodroof’s core. As most members of his Dallas Buyers Club are gay or transgender, the straight Woodroof, who previously never had to work hard to sate his sexual appetite, takes note of a young woman picking up drugs at his motel headquarters. Once he learns she has full blown AIDS not a moment passes before the two are going at it in the shower. When he was diagnosed, Woodroof entered a sexual desert. Despite the effects on his ever-deteriorating health, he kept up all of his vices (coke and booze) but one. There is something sweet and poignant about seeing him get to have animalistic sex<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> without consequence once again.</p>

<p>It’s a real testament to the cast<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em> has risen to the stature it has. McConaughey and Leto elevate an otherwise forgettable affair (I realize that’s an insane conceit, like saying that but for the cocoa those brownies tasted no good). Sometimes it’s not easy to separate out which aspects of a movie you like. I, for one, feel a little bad saying I don’t like the film since that there is so much in it that I <em>do</em> like. But all told, this one was a chore to get through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Campbell <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/73258510/sad-pictures-for-children/posts/759318">in a Kickstarter update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I shipped about 75% of kickstarter rewards to backers. I will not be shipping any more. I will not be issuing any refunds. For every message I receive about this book through e-mail, social media or any other means, I will burn another book.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The update (which is over 4000 words) is a rather intense polemic on art, capitalism and the ways in which people value one another.</p>

<p>Do read the whole thing, though, as Campbell later (rightly) warns:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Rayburn <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/02/heres-comcast-netflix-deal-structured-numbers.html">at StreamingMediaBlog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s been a lot of speculation involving the business and technical details surrounding the recent deal between Comcast and Netflix and plenty of wrong numbers and information being used. I thought it would be helpful to detail what’s really taking place behind the scenes, highlight some important publicly available data in the market, talk about the deal size, and debunk quite a few myths that people are spouting as facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smart piece that walks you through how streaming works and where the money is.</p>

<p>Here’s something interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a little known, but public fact, anyone who is on Comcast and using Apple TV to stream Netflix wasn’t having quality problems. The reason for this is that Netflix is using Level 3 and Limelight to stream their content specifically to the Apple TV device. What this shows is that Netflix is the one that decides and controls how they get their content to each device and whether they do it via their own servers or a third party. Netflix decides which third party CDNs to use and when Netflix uses their own CDN, they decide whom to buy transit from, with what capacity, in what locations and how many connections they buy, from the transit provider. Netflix is the one in control of this, not Comcast or any ISP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my gut the Netflix-Comcast deal still feels wrong.</p>

<p>Yet it’s interesting to note that Netflix does pick and choose transit providers for different devices. Why? And do the device manufacturers have a say in this? If Apple is negotiating for prime delivery, doesn’t that undercut net neutrality as well?</p>

<p>This is a whole can of worms that will probably be the major technology story of 2014, but there are so many factors involved it’s hard for most readers to keep up. So sensationalism always wins.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Singer writing about “forensic cinematologists” (online debaters trying to get to the bottom of any filmic ambiguities) at <a href="http://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/435-the-misguided-detective-work-of-the-csi-cinema-sce/"><em>The Dissolve</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This obsession with finding the “answers” frequently skews film conversations into fruitless tangents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Singer then gets into some specifics of <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> that I think are beside the point for my purposes here, concluding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lengthy debate returned no resolution, but even if it had, what would it have added to the film itself? Nothing. The debaters missed the forest while studying the specific taxonomy of one single, irrelevant tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This endless pontificating on specific aspects of movies is certainly <em>something</em>, but an appreciation of cinema it is not.</p>

<p>Alas, we live in an era in which promoting such detective work is good, viral business. See under: summer movie campaigns.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nilay Patel <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5431382/the-internet-is-fucked">for <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internet access isn’t a luxury or a choice if you live and participate in the modern economy, it’s a requirement. Have you ever been in an office when the internet goes down? It’s like recess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Preach.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>I give <em>The Verge</em> <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/07/done-with-the-verge/">a lot of shit</a> but Nilay’s piece is a great walk-through of the current political situation in US.</p>

      <p>That said, I can’t necessarily abide that bro-tastic headline. There’s something…unsavory about the Internet being fucked which is, you know, the analogy at hand. Plus there’s the unfortunate closer from Free Press President Craig Aaron: “We can still unfuck the internet.”</p>

      <p>The piece is a call to arms with accompanying shareable graphic displaying appropriate email and phone contacts at the FCC, asking readers to file complaints beneath the headline “HOW TO UNFUCK THE INTERNET.” Because what we really need is a bunch of dudebros calling up asking for an unfucked Internet.</p>

      <p>Nilay’s article is a great overview. And the suggestion to flood the FCC with complaints is a wise one that <em>requires</em> a bit of sensationalism to light a fire under folks’ asses. (But still…)<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christian Annyas <a href="http://annyas.com/screenshots/warner-bros-logo/">on the Warner Bros. logo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I couldn’t find a good overview with all logos gathered in one place, so I started to collect them myself, in 2009. Now, five years later, I think I have enough to paint a picture of Warner Bros logo design evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comprehensive and gorgeous. I feel like I should have known (or even surmised, honestly) that Saul Bass designed the 1972-1984 logo (#10).</p>

<p>Set aside some time and mouse over the over 200 logos Annyas collected.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alec Baldwin <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/alec-baldwin-good-bye-public-life.html">in New York Magazine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used to engage with the media knowing that some of it would be adversarial, but now it’s superfluous at best and toxic at its worst. If MSNBC went off the air tomorrow, what difference would it make? If the Huffington Post went out of business tomorrow, what difference would it make?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with much of his piece but Baldwin’s disdain may be misdirected. The question isn’t what if MSNBC or the Huffington Post goes dark tomorrow, it’s what if Facebook does. What if Twitter disappears? Which is to suggest that the problem isn’t the media, it’s us. Baldwin intimates as much later in the piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The heart, the arteries of the country are now clogged with hate. The fuel of American political life is hatred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And still later, on living in New York City since 1979:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be a New Yorker meant you gave everybody five feet. You gave everybody their privacy. I recall how, in a big city, many people had to play out private moments in public: a woman sobbing at a pay phone (remember pay phones?), someone studying their paperwork, undisturbed, at the Oyster Bar, before catching the train. We allowed people privacy, we left them alone. And now we don’t leave each other alone. Now we live in a digital arena, like some Roman Colosseum, with our thumbs up or thumbs down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a time the entire world didn’t have a camera in their pocket—the first thing that cell phones did was to kill the autograph business. Nobody cares about your autograph. There are cameras everywhere, and there are media outlets for them to “file their story.” They take your picture in line for coffee. They’re trying to get a picture of your baby. Everyone’s got a camera. When they’re done, they tweet it. It’s … unnatural.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I know, boo hoo for the famous the person, but I think he’s on to something that requires at least a little introspection on our part. How do we separate the person from the celebrity? How do we tell the difference between the gossip and the news?</p>

<p>Anyway, Baldwin closes with the worst thing a person can say about New York:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything I hated about L.A. I’m beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that. But New York has changed. Manhattan is like Beverly Hills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oof.</p>
