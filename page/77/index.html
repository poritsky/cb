  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07
/Life_during_wartime-500x333.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/Life_during_wartime-
500x333-300x199.jpg" alt="Life During Wartime Still" /></a>A pedophile, a Bar Mitzvah boy and a serial
widow are just a few of the colorful characters that populate Todd Solondz’s
brilliant dark comedy, <em>Life During Wartime</em>. It is high in the running for
the best film I’ve seen this year, and not only because it features a naked
Allison Janney (doing the nasty with_Godzilla’s_ Mayor Ebert, no less). With
subtle hints of magical realism and the classiest perwinkle suit you’re bound
to see this year, <em>Wartime</em> is a small, talky picture that digs into your
flesh and refuses to let go.</p>

<p>The ensemble film centers on the experience of Timmy (Dylan Riley Snyder), a
12-year old  looking forward to becoming the man of the house at the age of
thirteen. His mother, Trish (Allison Janney), is desperately seeking Jewish
companionship, which she finds in Harvey (Michael Lerner). Trish’s sister, Joy
(Shirley Henderson) is in for an extended visit after her ex-con boyfriend
(Michael K. Williams) reverts to making pervy crank calls. Meanwhile, Timmy’s
presumed-dead father (Ciarán Hinds) has just been released from prison, and is
on a mission to be as much of a creep as possible all over town. There’s more,
much more actually, but this is a character driven film, so there is no great
way to describe the plot, a fact which works only to <em>Wartime’s</em> advantage.</p>

<p>Solondz’s sick humor reminds me of the films of the Joel and Ethan Coen,
specifically <em>Fargo</em>. If that film is a dark comedy, then <em>Wartime</em> is black
as night. In the former, the laughs are physical, gruesome; we laugh because
we are discomfited by watching bumbling killers, the absurdity of seeing a
human foot shoved desperately into a wood chipper. With Solondz, the laughs
come from an even darker place. Without any disfigurement or brutality, he is
able to access a place inside each of us that can laugh at peophilia, giggle
at suicide and take Paul Rubens seriously. Frightening stuff.</p>

<p>And while we’re on the subject of the Coens, I’d be remiss if I didn’t bring
up the perceived overlap between this film and <em>A Serious Man</em>. Both are about
the tumultuous time leading up to a Bar Mitzvah, both spend a great deal of
time focusing on a single philosophical sticking point (“forgive and forget”
replaces “Schrödinger’s Cat”), and both end well before you want them to.
Also, both feature Michael Lerner. What do the similarities mean? Well,
sometimes, as viewers, we just get lucky–in this case, three preeminent Jewish
filmmakers working out similar demons upon similar canvases.</p>

<p>In one of <em>Wartime</em>’s many revealing scenes, Trish and Harvey discuss their
possible future on their first date. Clutching the Chai around her neck, Trish
asks “Have you ever been to Israel?” “No,” and with a wonderfully subtle I
-want-to-get-laid-tonight glint in his eyes, Harvey fires back, “But I want to
be buried there.” This comment gets Trish “Wet…” (awkward beat) “all over.”</p>

<p>The fact that we don’t know whether Harvey is a huckster or a true believer is
the kind of ambiguity that makes <em>Life During Wartime</em> such a rich film. Every
word must be digested and interpreted; no moment is wasted. So much is
revealed about each character with every inch of every frame, yet the weight
of the material never brings you down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps I’m a curmudgeon - okay I definitely am - on the subject of
technological social etiquette, but honestly, the nagging iPad questions have
to stop. The thing has been out for three months now, and there are Apple
Stores aplenty to go and diddle with the thing for the overly curious. Still,
I get odd looks and uncomfortable questions from strangers all the time. In
week one, it was cool; now, not so much.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear here: I’m not talking about a mutual friend, a coworker, a
family member or a member of your social graph coming over to stroke your
aluminum and glass baby. Those folks can play all they like. I’m talking about
complete strangers who want you to sell them on the iPad just because they
noticed you had one. On the subway, in a cafe, standing on the street;
strangers have shown no mercy in their quest to learn more about this
“magical” non-computer computer.</p>

<p>Enough. I’ve had it. Here is a guide to avoid making iPad users uncomfortable,
surly and want to go home and write a blog post about how much you suck.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="dont-ask-if-i-love-my-ipad">1. Don’t Ask if I Love My iPad</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do love my iPad, for a number of reasons, but they are probably different
from yours. I don’t love your wife, but I’m sure you think she’s the tops.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="dont-mention-ill-get-the-next-one">3. Don’t Mention “I’ll Get the Next One”</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re jazzed about the iPad 2, which doesn’t exist, then don’t ask me
about my iPad. You’re making two social blunders when you bring this up: 1)
You’re wasting my time because you don’t actually give a crap about the iPad
and 2) you’re passing a judgement on my early adoption.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="dont-tell-me-about-your-kindle">4. Don’t Tell Me About Your Kindle</h2>

about your Kindle, and you don’t care about my iPad. Haven’t we covered this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/dogtooth.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06
/dogtooth-300x198.jpg" alt="Dogtooth Still" /></a>One of the greatest aesthetic strengths
of <em>Dogtooth’_s execution is perhaps its implicit nature, one that
intentionally confuses and overwhelms to illustrate the horrific outcomes of a
concerned parental nature. Director Giorgos Lanthimos gives little exposition
to grasp, expecting an attentive audience to catch the complex designs of the
world created by the Greek parents of secluded children, but also to ignite an
empathetic confusion that these children would experience if allowed to view
the world beyond their parent’s design. The film’s approach towards audience
engagement is unconventional, yet brilliantly metaphoric (hence it’s _Un
Certain Regard</em> award), yet <em>Dogtooth</em> is also quite traditional in its
coming-of-age themes and agenda, all appropriate combinations for a world
cinema classic.</p>

<p>The film starts with some initially innocent moments, in which three siblings
listen to a homemade instructional audio tape that illustrates definitions for
words, but adventurous words like “sea” and “excursion” are given other
meanings, “sea” is a word that describes a leather chair, while “excursion” is
a “resistant material used to construct floors.” The children are
simultaneously introduced, as they listen to these definitions, confused and
distracted by other ideas that seem to form revolving about competitive games
of endurance (the youngest sibling suggests a game in which they all place
their hands beneath hot water to see whom can remain the longest).</p>

<p>While this moment that introduces parent-imposed rules, and the children
resolution of mis-direction, is surreal it is where our attention is focused
that suggests the real misfortune. Instead of giving attention to performance,
or character, the audience is immediately struggling to comprehend the meaning
behind these false connections. This initial audience-subject (non)interaction
suggests a larger inhumanity beyond simply re-designed definitions and the
games, we are made to ignore the real emotions of fear and painful confusion
to focus on semantics and structural codes. These thought processes mirror the
initial reactions to any real-world situations of a similar nature, and our
identification with these emotional problems comes too late for any safe
resolutions.</p>

<p>While these false-definitions and games suggest a specific critical analysis
of Greece’s educational system, it also begins a larger analysis of the
international fear of external forces overtaking traditional/domestic values.
The father of this family is declared as the only one able to safely leave the
house grounds, and fears are instilled of any other external interactions. In
one instance a cat, found in their yard, is fearfully and violently attacked.
This shocking moment reinforces the point of unnecessary cruelty and further
argues against false tales that border on the propagandistic. These fears and
anxieties are not just Greek, but can be found as part of any country’s
international stance on “terrorism,” or even against another country’s
oppositional political agenda. The threat against any one country’s
homogenized ideas is ultimately not that of external forces, but those
oppressed within these arbitrary confines.</p>

<p>What further reinforces the allegory of political structures of fear and
power, the parents are powerful enough to instill hopes and dreams of
connection with the impossible: every time a plane flies overhead, the
children express their desires to catch it when it falls. This impossible
dream reinforces parental control, as they know these children will never be
able to achieve this dream and there is no danger of their desires leaving the
safety of their control. To appease them, the mother tosses a small toy plane
into the back yard, as the children race excitedly to connect with the one
approved interaction with the world beyond their own. But, the mother can only
quench these desires for so long, as dreams tend to expand into greater and
more emotionally complex needs. The hope and strength of these dreams find
their way into the head of the eldest daughter, who finds ways to subvert
these house rules to expand her continued desire to know more. Her attempts
turn heroic, as she continually surprises in her ingenuity to finds ways to
interact with outside world. The moment of true audience comfort and
identification comes when she gains access to smuggled VHS tapes of Avildsen’s
<em>Rocky</em> and Spielberg’s <em>Jaws</em>, which not only open up positive emotions of
humor and inspiration, but also a multitude of Pandoric doors that lead to
both hope and suppression.</p>

<p>Instead of a healthy relationship between family members and appropriate
development into adulthood, these imposed restraints begin to breed
illiteracy, unemployable life skills, unrealistic dreams, jealousy and
animosity. When the father chastises a young woman for introducing his
daughter to <em>Rocky</em> and <em>Jaws</em>, he reacts violently upon her and curses her “I
hope your kids have bad influences and develop a bad personality.” This is
perhaps a direct attack not only on American culture, but upon the
hypocritical stance taken by any country against opposing forms of ideology.</p>

<p>In the end, the father becomes the nightmare his rules are meant to prevent,
and questioning the hypocrisy of such ridiculously deluded solutions of
seclusion are what seems successfully revealed in <em>Dogtooth</em>. It is this young
woman’s struggle to overcome these rules that Lanthimos masterfully defines as
a universal metaphor for a younger generation’s attempts to define their own
ways of functioning in a world rife in confusion, pain, and ultimately
ambiguous achievement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/meatthezoo.jpg" title="Me at the Zoo Still" />While there is no train advancing towards the screen in <em>Me at the zoo</em>, from user “jawed,” there is something hidden and more meaningful behind the seemingly unimpressive events in this video. The protagonist, if one can call him such, enacts common uses of film/video language: he narrates through direct address and directs our attention through gesture while the camera composes him quite squarely within a mise-en-scene, which also conveys action and depth via the distant elephant and receding wall to the camera’s left, which visually recalls the depiction of depth within the documented <em>arrival of a train at La Ciotat Station</em>. While neither works are the first visual documents of their medium, they both imply greater value at work.</p>

<p>The composition within <em>Me at the zoo</em>, at first directs our attention into the belief that the protagonist is the point of the clip. Though our eyes remain focused on him, we are given a chance to participate with his environment; we are directed toward the elephants at the end of his statement about “really, really long trunks…” , which is reinforced when he turns to view them. Just as we share in this moment, he finishes with “And that’s pretty much all there is to say.” The clip comes to an abrupt end, and we are left with our memory of the events that have occurred. Yet the events and the clip are separate. What we, as internet audience members, have come to realize is that our memory of interaction is reliant upon another’s world has come into our own via the thin conduits of technology. There’s no way in which an elephant and a zoo can be transported into my own space, and yet we’ve been able to participate with jawed as if it’s really been possible.</p>

<p>What is called to mind is an “elephant in the room,” and in this case the elephant has literally ended up in my room. Yet this process goes un- verbalized, and at this point in time, these facts go overlooked because of the medium’s intuitive process of connection. The oversimplified consumption glosses over the complex nature of internet clip participation, a nature beyond (now) simple Hitchcockian voyeurism that I find more phrased as “Interception”. This intimate commingling of human optics and virtual feeding, through signals pretending to be real moments, are only sustained by the need for a continuity not actually offered (even via the perpetual lifecasting of <em>Justin.tv</em>). This much needed continuity of reality is conveyed through physical boundaries, one cannot participate with another human’s thoughts like puppeteer Craig Schwartz in <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, yet the internet does allow us to participate with something that is not present in a way that film/video/television does not afford so successfully: immediacy and control over such.</p>

<p>The enactment of free-will and the spontaneity of life find metaphor in this moment of Interception with jawed’s clip. No longer are we just watching, through the personal control over technology we can immediately re-watch, we can concretely recall, and we can immediately respond. All these actions suggest there is in fact something real happening, and the importance is larger than just the implied simplicity of the clip. There <em>is</em> much more to say beyond the bare facts of elephants possessing long trunks, they have found a new form of existence within any moment of Interception. This new realm of existence is completely different than any historically mediated interaction, perhaps the closest media-analogy of contemporary multi-verse theory. This elephant is no longer trapped within the bars of the zoo, which have taken on a metaphorical outlay of previous film/video footage. This elephant now resides within a virtual existence both nowhere and everywhere –a talent of the internet medium that film/video/television is not afforded.</p>

<p><em>“Me at the zoo” was uploaded to Youtube on April 23rd, 2005, making it the first video ever on the site. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw">You can view it here</a></em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The following review was originally written for <a href="http://www.heebmagazine.com/chosen-film-_cyrus_-at-sxsw/">Heeb Magazine during SXSW
2010</a>. Reposting
here for the film’s limited release.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06
/cyrus-hill-tomei-oreilly.jpg"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cyrus-hill-tomei-
oreilly-300x222.jpg" alt="" /></a>If you’re not familiar with Sundance regulars
Jay and Mark Duplass, you will be once <em>Cyrus</em> drops later this year. After
multiple shorts, these indie golden boys (two of the originators of
the<a href="http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28
/mumblecore-auteurs-get-ready-for-their-close-up/">“mumblecore” genre</a>) grabbed real star power
for their first studio feature, with John C. Reilly, Jonah Hill and Marisa
Tomei as an uncomfortably Oedipal love triangle. If the crowds at SXSW are any
indication – and they are, check your old Oscar ballots – <em>Cyrus</em> will end up
a huge romantic comedy hit, which will be amazing since so much of the movie
is so damn creepy.</p>

<p>Puffy, sweaty and out of shape mess Reilly has, surprisingly, been creeping
toward leading-man territory for years, but <em>Cyrus</em> is the first film he’s
carrying on his own. Playing John, a divorced film editor whose only friend is
his soon-to-be-remarried ex-wife, his rubbery face and incredible comedic
timing squeeze laughs out of extreme humiliation. Things start looking up for
the pathetic schlub when Tomei, a too-gorgeous-to-be-with-a-loser-like-that
leading lady, enters, but there’s one problem: her twenty-one year old son,
Cyrus. Hill is cast, almost too perfectly, as a mewling, possessive man-baby,
and the step-father/son tensions provide more laughs than anyone should expect
from mainstream stars, but that’s what you get when the second fiddles – the
guys who made it on talent rather than looks – get a chance to play lead.</p>

<p>There are heartfelt scenes, sure, but that’s not really this film’s charm. If
anything, these moments of realization are the weakest points. It’s the
awkward bits that kill, e.g., the look on Reilly’s face as son Cyrus casually
walks into the bathroom while his mother is showering. (I call it the “Is this
really happening?” expression.) Just as David Gordon Green rode <em>The Pineapple
Express</em> into the mainstream, Jay and Mark Duplass will cross over with
<em>Cyrus</em>. Ed Helms and Jason Segel have already signed on for their next flick.
If it’s as funny as this one, all Hollywood’s back-up guys, wacky neighbors
and wingmen will soon be begging the Duplasses for a chance to fly solo.</p>

Beesley editor Lousiana Kreutz’s eleven minute <em>The Bicycle Cowboy</em> doesn’t
just hark back to the feeling of early 20th century American cinema, but
provides for an interesting metaphor about the clash of today’s progressive
movement. We’re first introduced to a cowboy riding along an unseen pathway,
but only revealed from waist up. Traditional cowboy iconography calls to mind
concepts of American honor and duty, yet what the camera reveals is this
cowboy rides upon a bicycle. This addendum to traditional cowboy iconography
implies activism, energy conservation, and anti-capitalism/globalism. These
concepts are usually in constant battle, and what’s so interesting about this
imagery, suggests that our concept of mythic history should contend with an
updated concept of “the West,” one in which activism is just as dominant a
mode of conduct in America as that of any codes of the “western.”  As two
cowboys fight over the control of bikes for the heart of a young woman what
results is a narrative that questions the conventions of aggressive and
competitive resolution. The film ends with a “winner,” as both cowboys come to
realize the young woman has played them against each other. While the
reconfiguration of the American cowboy myth is progressive, what remains a
problem is the inactive female, upon whom the blame remains at the end of the
film (the implied indecisiveness is quite misogynistic). Perhaps any follow up
cycle, as is the nature of American myth/cinema, will address such problems.</p>

<p>In <em>Mr. Hypnotism</em> Brad Beesley’s talent of finding unique individuals is
paired with his abilities to conjure honesty in a document of fiendish
magician Dr. Ronald Dante. The film has a great array of historical footage
and contemporary magic act scenes that reveals less about his day-to-day
manipulation skills and more of his clever wit. And while Ronald Dante is an
amazingly funny character, what’s most interesting is not his entertaining
abilities, but why he’s such great manipulator. The film introduces some
notoriety about his star-adjacent nature, or his faux-university scam, but
what would take these interesting anecdotes to another level is observing
immediate moments where we see how it is Dante manipulates anyone with his
charming personality. <em>Hypnotism</em> feels as though it’s a short dedicated to
revealing the structure of a lengthier piece, who’s reason for abandonment
comes when Dante explicitly acknowledges he was a con man without any mystery.
Yet, Dante’s flat out admission implies something working beyond the moments
captured, beyond his seemingly open interviews to suggest he’s perhaps
manipulated this work to its conclusions so quickly for his own reasons. The
film has successfully made me desire more of the story, more of Dante, and
more of the film’s revelations about humanity, performance, and perhaps our
own masochistic desires to be manipulated.</p>

<p>Salisbury’s capture of the Flaming Lips’s Embyronic album creation methods on
HD reveals not only the more sculpted nature of “improv” (through pronounced
references to Godard’s <em>Sympathy For the Devil</em>), but defines comfort in
exploration. Just as in <em>Sympathy</em>, <em>Blastula: The Making of Embryonic</em> has a
dominant image: a camera that searches for a moment – something yet to be
defined, a strong allegory to the band’s process. While, in <em>Sympathy</em>, such
moments reveal to the audience an ultimate conclusion about the political
metaphor of The Rolling Stones’ “Beggar’s Banquet,” <em>Blastula</em> is less clear
about any such revelation about the Lips’ album Embryonic. Although this is
historically against the nature of The Lips’ representation, the film does
defy this marketing strategy in clearly revealing band members’ identities,
relationships, and thought processes through expository and conventional
talking-head interviews. The strength of this work relies on this
juxtaposition, and provides an entry point to what would otherwise be
seemingly unrelated dolly shots. The excitement of this film does not
necessarily arrive via the nature of wonder and mystery (like it does within
the Lips’ feature <em>Christmas On Mars</em>), but more in the moments of
understanding when achievement does occur – the real resultant joys of
anything improvised are extremely difficult to reveal, and is the real success
of this interesting making-of document.</p>

content/uploads/2010/06/heroinhymnstill-
300x170.jpg" alt="Still from Heroin Hymn" /></a>While Okie Shorts provided some
great works this year (such as the comedy sketch <em>My Own Prometheus _about
morning coffee and multiple morning identities, or the much talked about faux-
documentary _Faith Healer</em>, who’s documented protagonists leaving a project
reveals less about the film than the metaphor for audience and film-subject
relationship), my interest was in two shorts that made analyses of Oklahoma a
primary part of their structure.</p>

<p>Jerry Melichar’s <em>Landlocked</em> is a confidently executed piece that follows a
Tulsa high-school biology teacher, Martha Hall, who is driven more by her
passion of the aquatic than as an educator. The plot, revolving around a
resentful student’s false accusation about Hall embezzling class trip funds to
a Florida aquatic center, suggests larger political influences. Martha Hall is
trapped within a financial context in which there is no support for
educational engagement for students (something both regionally and nationally
specific), but she is guilty of imposing her desires of escape within this
field trip that conflicts with education’s primary selfless purpose. With
Hall’s apathetic and violent daydreams, the film also suggests that in these
times of educational poverty educators are just as prone to moments of
dangerous explosion as any kids with weapons. The subtext of financial
struggle urges a resolve over complaints of high taxes and problematic budget
allocation that does not result in escapeing the “brain drain” of not just
graduates, but educators. While the film’s ending is satisfactory in Hall’s
eventual escape, it satirically implicates our sympathy as apathy –perhaps the
real reason behind any educational budgetary problem is our own indecision and
inaction, resulting in our criminal complicity with Hall at the end of the
film.</p>

<p>Patrick George’s <em>Heroin Hymn</em> is described as a poetic tale about the
homeless in downtown Oklahoma City, but there is a realism that underlies the
physical context of the narrative that is implicitly critical as much as it is
emotionally sympathetic. We follow a homeless couple who place their disease
of addiction before their own abilities to anticipate safety and needs in a
series of scenes that are quite familiar: panicked cravings, begging and
scheming for drug satisfaction, prostitution, and emotionally unstable
conflicts between addicted partners. While these are situations seen in many
drug pictures, it’s the talents of Kevin Pollard and Andrea Moser that allow
these moments to take on an immediate presence and emotional weight. The
locations of the work also present a keen eye towards describing an Oklahoma
City landscape that is often relegated to more exploitive genre works rather
than the more quiet and contemplative exploration of the hidden imagery of the
city. These sections of the city are “projects” for commercial update, and
George is able to describe the flip side of such development, that of both
dependence and dismissal. These characters are caught between those incoming
classes that begin to enable their habits through sexual or drug transactions,
and the refusal to empower or support them through any assistance supplied by
organizations in these areas. The world drafted in <em>Hymn</em> depicts no
supportive activities, and suggests these necessary needs of transition from
overlooked landscape to a ‘revised’ neighborhood can result in the symptoms of
these characters: isolation, dependence, and ultimately death. The last place
to which these characters can turn are the hidden apartment rooms where deals
go bad, and lost dreams never find their redemption. Although the humanistic
execution of <em>Hymn</em> implies these thoughts, the work could be expanded upon to
balance out the argument, and potentially deepen the power of the piece,
through more explicit scenes that addresses the daily ramifications of
gentrification, commercial redistricting, drug market and the limitations of
local organization support.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I headed over to a hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to sit down with directors Ricki Stern and Anne Sundebrg (who prefers to be called Annie).
No doubt the setting was picked to appease the eponymous subject of their new documentary, <em>Joan Rivers - A Piece of Work</em>, who actually lives a few blocks from where we met. The day started with a roundtable with
Ms. Rivers, who unleashed her token scathing wit. Bits of that session, and the one you are about to hear, were for a <a href="http://www.heebmagazine.com/joan-
rivers-everyones-favorite-dirty-grandmother-talks-about-her-new-documentary/">piece I wrote for Heeb Magazine</a>. The real story of any documentary, however, comes not from the subject but from the filmmakers themselves, which is why I was delighted
to talk to Ricki and Annie about their latest project.</p>

<p>The film is a solid study of an extraordinary woman, and it avoids the pitfalls an trappings many similar documentaries fall victim too. There are limited talking heads and archival footage is used in a very organic
manner; it is neither reality show nor biography, but something more. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that the Ms. Stern and Ms. Sunberg’s previous works deal in much weightier material, such as Darfur. As they
explain, they are simply after a good story and Joan provided one for them. They simply wanted to capture something compelling. Listen in for some fascinating insight from these excellent filmmakers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/FILM_deadCENTERX.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/FILM_deadCENTERX.jpg" alt="Deadcenter X Logo" /></a>A series of great shorts that
redefine the manner in which “kids work’ is compared with “professional,” one
in which “kid/student” is simply an age level rather than a definition of
cinematic ability of expression or articulation.</p>

<p>Amy Bench’s work <em>In this Place</em> at first glance suggest a rudimentary
application of graphic compositing, as a young woman shifts through background
layouts of bright and exotic locations. We come to learn that Jane, a young
explorer, is simply finding the means of escape from the low contrast, and
more realistically photographed, 35mm footage with her mind’s eye of
exploration in bright HD imagery. While this juxtaposition in itself holds a
fascinating approach towards these two mediums and their relationship with
young filmmakers, it also provides a justification for these compositing
techniques that imply this artifice is of the love and excitement of
imagination. Jane’s boring conversations with her condescending older brothers
further perpetuates her desires for escapism, but when she attempts to develop
her imaginary travels through video distribution, the distributor tells her
the material is unrealistic and overly amateurish. Jane focuses her skills as
a dreamer and video-maker to delight and reconnect her family through a love
video made specifically for them, as she brings them into the emotionally
bright HD footage away from the oppressive and dreary 35mm realism, bridging
the gap between the optimistic visions of youth and falsely-imposed
definitions of cinematic quality.</p>

<p>Temple Tucker’s <em>The Ribbon</em> captures the delicate balance of young
imagination’s existence through thoughtful cinematic composition that relies
on tasteful and tactile imagery as well as contemplative moments of what would
otherwise be an overly internalized world. The young girl, who almost waits
for the departure of her mother to explore the situations in her mind, beckons
for a spark of inspiration that can take her beyond the confines of her
quotidian day-dreams. A fascinating moment finds the young girl performing
shadow puppetry of sword-yielding maidens fighting dinosaurs that ends in a
burning at the stake. Though these moments suggest dark undertones of self-
deprecation and social ostracization, they are important contrasts of
imagination to the beloved pink ribbon that takes her to playgrounds of packed
excitement and possibilities. The complicated depiction of a child’s fears
meshed with their dreams are the result of amazing observation of a child’s
wonder.</p>

<p>Three great and fascinating shorts by young filmmaker Bunee Tomlinson suggest
he is quickly becoming one of Oklahoma’s most prolific and talented young
filmmakers to watch, two of which are not to miss:</p>

<p>His first film, <em>Mom’s Favorite Vase</em> is a unique coming-of-age buddy comedy
of two young preteens whom break a vase while mom is busy in another room.
They spend their day piecing together this vase in hopes of mom overlooking
its ruined stature, only to come to futility. The smartest choices about this
film are it’s clear character building between the audience and these young
boys, whom surprise you with every moment of the expression of frustrations
beyond their years, which further removes them from the day’s playtime to
complete this project in hiding.</p>

<p><em>Without a Doubt</em>, Tomlinson’s next short follows a decision of love-choice
between two suitors: a teenage pen-pal, or current teenage boyfriend. The film
is funny because of its balance of awkward teenage love and a real emotional
underpinning of excited new connections, but it is also amazingly able to
maintain a charm and innocence in every gesture and call for “love” by the
washout pen pal, who’s performance leaves no doubt he firmly believes in
romantic clichés despite the failures of it’s affect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/the-
terrible-thing-of-alpha-9.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/the-terrible-thing-of-
alpha-9.jpg" alt="The Terrible Thing of Alpha 9! Still" /></a>While these shorts provide for some great
laughs, it’s the smart choices from intelligent directors that make these
funny moments meaningful and memorable beyond their short duration.</p>

<p>Starting off the comedy block is commercial director Jeremy Berger’s <em>The
Van</em>, which is able to provide some laughter due to it’s confident style and
juxtaposition of Herman Melville’s poetics with a more crass modern humor.
Although the image of a blow-up sex toy is paired with Moby Dick’s narrator
description of his unhindered history of exploits plays on the social comedy
of manners, the film unfortunately hit’s it’s peak. The chase between a biker
messenger and the “white van” that assaults bikers is reliant upon technical
proficiency rather than motivated by the psychological or emotional complexity
of Melville. Perhaps what is lacking is the reason behind the pairing of the
text of Moby Dick within the world of the bike-messenger that would really
take the work into more complicated jokes, and perhaps become a more biting
satire of contemporary eco-business warfare.</p>

<p>Remington Dewan’s <em>The Lemonade Stand</em>, on the other hand, is able to clearly
design the metaphor of young business within a young teenager’s first
neighborhood lemonade stand. What makes Dewan’s film stronger is a protagonist
whose motivations are clear: pseudo-hip business lingo and the addictive game
of profit margins is what excites the young entrepreneur, so much she’s
invited her friend to join her in this excitement. <em>The Lemonade Stand</em> is
thus able to clearly lay out the conflict strongly present in contemporary
comedies like NBC’s <em>The Office</em>, where the successful business is in conflict
with simple humanity.  In the end, the young protagonist confronts the limits
of business, and stands up for her friend when a competing water stand
dismisses the emotions of her friend. Humanity overcomes the shrewd coming of
age business story.</p>

<p><em>Wasting Daylight</em>, the mockumentary of social activists against Daylight
Savings Time is conceptually funny and provides not only the strongest
contender of character humor, but also the strongest performances of the
comedy block. The strength of the short is it’s ability to quickly hone
characters beyond the talking heads format and convey a strong and clear sense
of character and personality, allowing for very successful humor to naturally
spring from clashes of personality types rather than situations or visual
gags. While this short has the strongest character direction, it lingers the
longest. The concept of these personality conflicts is clear, but more
reliance upon the audience to catch on to each character’s personal agenda
could be given, especially due to the strength of Joe Parker’s choices going
into the shooting and his confident handling of back story with the
performers.</p>

<p>Although Oklahoman Terry Holloway’s <em>The Robbery</em> is quick and sweet, it does
take a moment to realize when and what the joke is, but this is what makes the
film’s humor so inventive and funny! With visual homages to the indie
filmmaking of the nineties, this short sketch delivers a situation so
succinctly through carefully crafted physical gags and jokes, because of its
short duration it’s easy to dismiss the maturity of these decisions. The cues
and pace of the film direct my attention so clearly, I am not only able to
understand and empathize with a character that is so quickly introduced, but
I’m also able to anticipate the character’s actions in such limited amounts of
time that the moment the actions occur it’s as if I’ve willed the character to
do my bidding –and thus my participation in the joke makes for the unique and
clever comedy that reminds me of Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton.</p>

<p>The sweetest comedy, also playing in the Animation block of shorts, is <em>The
Terrible Thing of Alpha 9!</em> from <em>Ugly Americans</em>/<em>Superjail</em> animator Jake
Armstrong. While the animation’s design is hip and beautiful, it’s the
implicit commentary against “invade and conquer” that allows for a surprising
subtly in emotion when an alien monster with a reputation of evil turns out to
be as loving and loyal as a puppy. While the moment of the alien headhunter’s
violent death treads distasteful waters (its execution could be seen as
playing up the violence for drama and joke), it is the alien monster’s despair
at the loss of this life that lifts this cartoon violence into bittersweet
pity.</p>
