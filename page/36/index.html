  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/08/ad-wink.jpg" title="Arrested Development Wink-Wink" /></p>

<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/08/27/impact-of-arrested/">complained</a> about a GigaOM article that had no meat to its “Why <em>Arrested Development</em> on Netflix could change everything” headline. Here’s what I think it was lacking.</p>

<p>Back in February, <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/1679595/netflixs-head-of-content-sarandos-queues-up-an-original-programming-strategy">Fast Company’s Co.Create interviewed Ted Sarandos</a>, Netflix’s chief content officer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> He had this to say about the company’s distribution method of dropping an entire season of a series at once:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s unique about this initiative is we’re not really wrapped up in having a big opening and a big debut in terms of ratings. It’s not differentially important to me that anyone watches this show at any certain time. People will be discovering this show for the first time over the next several years, the same way they’re discovering <em>Mad Men</em> for the first time on Netflix today. But I want to try to stay out of the business of trying to influence America to do the same thing at the same time, which is a really expensive proposition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough. That <em>is</em> unique and more in line with the way people binge on television in 2012. However, in introducing the interview, Co.Create sneaks in this little-discussed detail (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…As the 15-year-old company gradually phases out its original means of distribution <strong>(<em>Lilyhammer</em> and <em>House of Cards</em> will <em>not</em> be available on DVD)</strong> it’s going to flex a muscle the other services don’t even have: With years of rentals and ratings, Netflix knows its audience’s taste inside and out and has built credibility at recommending new shows and movies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way to get these original series is through Netflix’s Watch Instantly, not through the company’s disc-by-mail service. It’s still unclear whether or not these shows will ever be available on disc anywhere, or even available for purchase. Which likely means the only way to access them a year, two years, ten years down the line will be to keep paying for Netflix. Think $70 for a Blu-ray season of a series is pricy? Try $8 a month indefinitely.</p>

<p>Netflix appears to be playing a long game here. Tired of being jerked around by studios and networks, Sarandos and CEO Reed Hastings are building up an armory of original content that will help them weather any stormy negotiation. It’s incredibly bold and forward thinking, far ahead of what anyone else is up to.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know whether Netflix will choose to sell discs for any of their original series. I do know, however, that DVD is a competing format to streaming, and Netflix is in no position to squander their format exclusivity.</p>

<p>The loser in all of this will be the consumer. When you buy a disc, you own it. Sure, movie studios will contest that claim, but at the very least you can put it on your shelf and watch it whenever you want, wherever you are. All you need is a player, a screen and a little bit of power. With streaming, of course, you need a player, a screen, a (decent) Internet connection and, usually, a WiFi router. If we hand over how we consume movies and TV shows to Netflix and tell them to hold onto our content, we will allow them to fundamentally change the home video game.</p>

<p>That may be fine. You may love Netflix. Hell, I do. But what happens when I fall out of love, or when they hike prices again? What happens when the company starts developing films and keeps them exclusive to streaming as well? And what if they fail and fall into obscurity? If released on disc, they could at the very least be preserved by fans and collectors.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Netflix’s original content initiative will be a huge success, especially with popular buys like <em>Arrested Development</em>. What worries me is that by the time we realize what we are giving up it will be too late. We’ll have crossed the bridge to streaming distribution just in time for Netflix to blow it up.</p>

<p>So yes, the show’s bow next Spring <em>could</em> change everything. I’m just not so sure we should be so blindly revelatory of that fact.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon, my pal <a href="http://twitter.com/TheJewishDream/">Rafi</a> alerted me to a <em>Halo 4</em> promo that is currently running before trailers in US movie theaters. I went to look it up and found two versions: an official one without voice-over from Microsoft’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXgOkRxGgFc">official Xbox YouTube account</a> and a bootleg from this year’s Comic-Con <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEU-e_cnMA0">posted by the Little English Halo Blog</a> featuring the narration that plays in theaters.</p>

<p>I don’t know why Microsoft is only playing the narration publicly, but for the sake of simplicty I cut the higher quality video with the Comic-Con voiceover and uploaded it to YouTube. Here it is:</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kGGpD4li87E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The transcript is below, but before that, some perspective:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arthur Miller&#8217;s first and, I think, only novel, <em>Focus</em>, was, in my opinion, every bit as good as his first produced play, <em>All My Sons</em>. I once asked him why, if he was equally talented in both forms, he chose to write plays. Why would he give up the total control of the creative process that a novel provides to write instead for communal control, where a play would first go into the hands of a director and then pass into the hands of a cast, set designer, producer, and so forth? his answer was touching. He said that he loved seeing what his work evoked in others. The results could contain revelations, feelings, and ideas that he never knew existed when he wrote the play. It&#8217;s what we all hope for.</p><footer><strong>-Sidney Lumet</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679756604/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679756604&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thecandlerblo-20">Making Movies</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I never thought about pitting movies <em>against</em> video games, but I’m thinking about it now. So, good work Microsoft?</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<blockquote><p>Creating <em>Halo 4</em>, in many ways, is a little like making a movie. There are a lot of the same components, a lot of the same technology, a lot of the same kinds of artists and musicians and designers.</p><p>On <em>Halo 4</em>, a significant portion of the game studio&#8217;s staff had movie backgrounds; skills and talent they&#8217;ve honed and polished in Hollywood on major theatrical productions and blockbuster movies. This game has motion capture specialists, people who capture fluid animation and occasionally, alien movement.</p><p><em>Halo</em> has a sweeping, soaring, cinematic score that pulls audiences into the emotion and action on the screen. They record that soundtrack with a sixty piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, the recording venue for <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Prometheus</em> and <em>The Avengers</em>.</p><p><em>Halo 4</em> has artists whose sole job is to create beautiful, compelling environments, worlds that, like the matte paintings from the golden age of cinema, make you feel like you&#8217;ve entered another world.</p><p><em>Halo</em> has prop builders and set designers, people whose mission is to craft incredible weapons and build legendary vehicles.</p><p>So yes, in some ways, making a video game is a little like making a movie, but, a movie, like a game, is a collaborative process with millions of moving parts. A movie is a singular vision, experienced in the same way every time. It&#8217;s a journey that the director takes you on, but in <em>Halo 4</em>, you&#8217;re the director. <em>You</em> are the star.</p><p>We&#8217;ll give you the tools to blaze a new trail and allow you to experience and inhabit worlds and heroes in a way a movie never can. It&#8217;s your journey. You control your own destiny, and there&#8217;s no magic quite like it.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost exactly seven months ago, I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/29/ads/">announced</a> the addition of ads to the candler blog. InfluAds has been an excellent partner. I have always been impressed with the simplicity of the ads they book. In most cases, they are from companies I either use, like or want to learn more about. Nothing about my relationship with InfluAds is being altered.</p>

<p>I do have another big change to announce, however. The candler blog will now feature weekly sponsorships. You may have seen similar setups on other sites,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but let me explain how it’s going to work here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the beginning of the week, I will publish a sponsored post.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> </li>
  <li>Near the end of the week I will publish a sponsored link post, pointing to the sponsor’s URL.</li>
  <li>Sponsored posts will always be labeled as such, as will any ad copy not written by me.</li>
  <li>Sponsors are exclusive by week, running from Monday to Sunday.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am still banging out some other details and working to find more sponsors. Soon, I’ll have a page dedicated to dealing with these sorts of sponsorships.</p>

<p>I run the candler blog alone, a fact I am very proud of. It is neither my intention to be an ad salesman nor to waste your time with superfluous content. As such, I will only be choosing sponsors whose presence I believe add some value for readers.</p>

<p>For now, this is a pilot program. I am excited and invigorated to move forward with sponsorships, but I am hyper-aware that the moment I become more focused on booking sponsors than creating original content, I have failed. As ever, I <a href="http://candlerblog.com/contact/">welcome your feedback on these changes</a> now and in the weeks to come as this new chapter of the candler blog’s narrative takes shape.</p>

<p>But enough blogging about blogging. I’m sure there’s a film or tech story out there I need to go whine about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yestreday, GigaOM published an article with the ambitious headline “Why <em>Arrested Development</em> on Netflix could change everything.” Everything!</p>

<p>Here’s Liz Shannon Miller <a href="http://gigaom.com/video/why-arrested-development-on-netflix-could-change-everything/">trying to make the case</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Arrested‘s</em> rebirth, over four years in the works, has the potential to completely change the game in terms of the way we regard web content in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game! Completely!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a long time until the spring of 2013, but looking forward it’s hard to imagine a more important signpost for the convergence of television and the web than <em>Arrested Development</em>. If it succeeds, it’ll legitimize a whole new distribution platform and business model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who hit publish on this?</p>

<p>I’m as excited as anyone to see new episodes of <em>Arrested Development</em>, but the fact that it will “air” and may even be watched by millions says little about the Web as a distribution outlet.</p>

<p>I think it will be a long time before Netflix lets us know whether or not this experiment is a success. Yes, <em>Arrested</em> may be to Netflix what <em>The Sopranos</em> was to HBO, but the fact that Miller plans to call in sick and watch the show in her pajamas with “hundreds and thousands of other devotees” has little bearing on that. Now, if they weren’t already Netflix subscribers to begin with, that’d be something huge.</p>

<p>There’s a great conversation to have about what Netflix is up to. Miller isn’t having it, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks to the New York Film Academy, this week’s sponsor of the candler blog.</em></p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/filmmaking/" rel="nofollow">Filmmaking</a>” is often thought to mean directing or producing, but in fact it is an all-encompassing word. The art, discipline and business of storytelling on film also includes writing, editing, collaborating, photography, building, logistics and technological faculty.</p>

<p>Filmmaking students at the New York Film Academy are immersed in the entire process from the first day of their education with the institution. They balance time between classroom instruction, workshops and directing – learning more than the technical “how” of filmmaking, but also delving into the “why” of movies and film.</p>

<p>Storytelling through film at <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/" rel="nofollow">NYFA</a> is both a technical and artistic experience, but just as important it is about the soft, “people” skills required on any movie production. For example, writers must know how to work with other writers, to respond to directors and producers, to script for acting talent and understand what can be accomplished in post- production. That is the NYFA experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>David Streitfeld for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/business/book-reviewers-for-hire-meet-a-demand-for-online-raves.html">The New York Times</a>, reporting on the dubious dealings of one Todd Rutherford:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suddenly it hit him. Instead of trying to cajole others to review a client’s work, why not cut out the middleman and write the review himself? Then it would say exactly what the client wanted — that it was a terrific book. A shattering novel. A classic memoir. Will change your life. Lyrical and gripping, Stunning and compelling. Or words to that effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disgusting.</p>

<p>Folks are putting more and more stock in customer reviews which, as we know, are bullshit. These systems will always be gamed. As long as there are fewer outlets to distribute digital wares, we’re stuck in this uphill battle against robots, hucksters and thieves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Erica Sadun at TUAW <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/08/24/devjuice-talking-with-tim-mcmorris-about-royalty-free-soundtrac/">interviewed Tim McMorris</a>, who caught her attention after his royalty-free track wowed her in a product promo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My creative process has always remained the same and has been quite simple – do all that you can to inspire the listeners. While styles of music change, this philosophy doesn’t so I don’t believe writing for TV or film influences this one way or another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice interview. <a href="http://audiojungle.net">AudioJungle</a>, where Tim sells his tracks, is a great resource for royalty-free music. Seems much broader than the Pump Audio drive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I used to rely on when I was onlining for TV.</p>
