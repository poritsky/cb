  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve titled this article with a question in response to Mike Fleming’s post over at Deadline, “<a href="http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/will-micro-budget-films-like-the-devil-inside-change-the-economics-of-studio-moviemaking/">Will Micro-Budget Films Like ‘The Devil Inside’ Change The Economics Of Studio Moviemaking?</a>”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something is happening here; studios are re-thinking the idea of overspending on risky projects (Warner Bros just unplugged Arthur &amp; Lancelot and Akira) when audiences are turning out for films like <em>The Devil Inside</em>. That no-budget film, acquired by Paramount’s new Insurge division, got about the worst reviews since <em>Plan 9 From Outer Space</em>, and still out-grossed movies made for significantly more money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve been hearing this since at least <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, but ever since the <em>Paranormal Activity</em> franchise started perennially minting cash, the rally cries for micro-budget crap have reached a fever pitch. I say crap because the bookkeepers who run movie studios don’t really care whether the work is good, just whether it comes in on time and cheap. That almost everyone with an opinion hated <em>The Devil Inside</em> is irrelevant. It had a 3,373% return on investment in only its first weekend! Who <em>doesn’t</em> want a piece of that action?</p>

<p>People who like movies.</p>

<p>This is what we call a race to the bottom. The studios will pump cash into any small project with a hopeful pitch (usually based on marketability, not, you know, story) until audiences get hip to the fact that these movies suck and stop going.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real loser here will be filmmakers with more ambitious projects because $1 million will be the new $10 million (which used to be the new $40 million). “Why would I give you $10 million to make a film when these guys did it for $1 million?” If the answer to that question is, “My film will be better,” studios won’t care. Success, in Hollywood, is measured in dollars.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll admit I’m being a bit cynical about all of this. If studios are emptying their coffers and making more work with emerging filmmakers, that should be a good thing. In fact, it may well be a great thing. That is up to the filmmakers who can land deals to make low-budget work.</p>

<p>I’m wary because, well, the film that we’re talking about proving this business model is <em>The Devil Inside</em>. Fleming puts it best at the end of his article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the <em>Paranormal Activity</em> films and <em>Insidious</em> have been highly profitable crowd pleasers, if studios refocus their attention on these down and dirty films, don’t expect the quality of movie making to get any better in 2012 than it was last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m just now catching up with the excellent and gorgeous <a href="http://contentsmagazine.net/">Contents Magazine</a>. I love their publishing model. Each “issue” comes out over the course of a few weeks, basically a string of feature-length blog posts released on a sparing schedule. Smart.</p>

<p>I highly recommend all writers take a look at Mandy Brown’s article in the inaugural issue, <a href="http://contentsmagazine.net/articles/babies-and-the-bathwater/">Babies and the Bathwater</a>. She lays out in plain English the way that the publishing landscape has changed for the better and how we, as writers, publishers, editors and readers, should be adapting.</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of Mandy’s article involves something I just dealt with when <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/10/more-than-a-new-design/">switching from Wordpress to Octopress</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Content people are fond of leaving the code to the geeks while we debate the merits of the Oxford comma, but there is a difference between programming and markup. HTML, whose own name comes from the editor’s act of “marking up” a text, is an element of the text itself—a machine- and human-readable expression of the text’s underlying semantic structure. This is a language that we can and must speak, because it not only determines how the text <em>looks</em> but what it <em>means</em>.</p><p>Which brings us to more bathwater: WYSIWYG-style document editors that ignore the principles of semantic markup or prevent us from engaging with the text completely deserve a path down the drain. We need to adopt the mindset that markup—HTML, in particular—is part of our job, and we need to demand tools that let us do it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I moved to a plain text workflow a while ago, but I always have trouble telling other people why I did, or why they should. The above quote pretty much says it all. Text is what I do.</p>

<p>It’s not that everyone should move to plain text, but people who write in public should have some understanding about what markup is. It’s possible to be vigilant and aware of markup in a WYSIWYG editor, but odds are you won’t notice if, for example, you’ve let a space fall into a block of bolded text or if you leave a letter or two unlinked.</p>

<p>Not every writer needs to learn code or Markdown or something, but at the very least they should have a passing understanding of what HTML is actually doing to their text. These are our <em>words</em>; they don’t come out of our heads by chance and we shouldn’t leave it up to the “nerds” to format it. The markup is part of our language whether we like it or not. If you haven’t yet, it’s time to learn it.</p>

<p>Working my way through the rest of Contents now. Also, check out Mandy’s other site, <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/">A working library</a>, where she has followed the aforelinked article up with two additions: <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/represent/">Represent</a> and <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/markup/">Markup</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>It seems to me that Western firms’ concentration on the DVD and the sidelining of the VCD exemplifies what management analysts have come to call “overshoot.” In the theory of disruptive technologies pioneered by Clayton Christensen, established firms aim to sustain an existing technology, either through incremental improvements or radical innovations. As the technology improves, these sustaining firms target the upper end of the market. Thus Eastman Kodak strove to improve its film stocks to satisfy and win the approval of the world’s top cinematographers. Likewise, Sony and other firms collaborated to create the DVD as an improvement on broadcast video, VHS, and laserdisc.</p><p>But in the process they left lower-end markets behind. Entrenched sustaining technology tends to be complicated, inconvenient, and expensive. Christensen posits that the big firms’ overshoot often leave space for firms that develop technology that is cheap, convenient, and “good enough” for what might be a very big segment of purchasers. To the professional eye, VHS was inferior to Beta tape and laserdisc, but for most consumers that tape format was good enough. Then DVD proved more convenient—smaller, more portable, easier to use—and of noticeably better quality. Experts knew that the DVD was still a compromise format, especially compared to 35mm, but for consumers it was good enough.</p><footer><strong>David Bordwell</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/01/11/pandoras-digital-box-from-the-periphery-to-the-center-or-the-one-of-many-centers/">Pandora’s Digital Box: From the Periphery to the Center, or the One of Many Centers</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a lot I could say about how foolish the major movie studios have been when it comes to moving into the digital realm. If I had to distill it all down to a single word, it would be this one: UltraViolet.</p>

<p>What is UltraViolet?</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a branded set of specifications and agreements along with a centralized rights clearinghouse that allows retailers to sell movies that play on UltraViolet-compatible players and services.</p><p>Put another way, UltraViolet is DVD for the Internet.</p><footer><strong>-Jim Taylor</strong> <cite><a href="http://uvdemystified.com/uvfaq.html#1.1">UltraViolet FAQ</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Uh huh.</p>

<p>So it’s not actually a streaming format but a cloud-based licensing service. Other streaming devices can hook into the UltraViolet licenses so you can buy media once and then gain access to it on multiple services. That is if other services choose to play ball. On paper it seems like a win for the studios since they get the licensing fees they need without the burden of technological innovation.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week Kim Novak very publicly said she felt raped (her word) by the use of Bernard Herrmann’s <em>Vertigo</em> score in <em>The Artist</em>. The editors at Press Play hate the casual use of that word and have concocted a great little contest to test the boundaries of reusing musical cues:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Take the same Herrmann cue &#8211; &#8220;Scene D&#8217;Amour,&#8221; used in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xYRUJUJNSw">this memorable moment from Vertigo</a> &#8211; and match it with a film clip from any film. (You can nick the three-minute section from one of Kevin&#8217;s mash-ups if it makes things easier.)</p><p>2. Although you can use any portion of &#8220;Scene D&#8217;Amour&#8221; as your soundtrack, the movie clip that you pair it with cannot have ANY edits; it must play straight through over the Herrmann music. This is an exercise in juxtaposition and timing. If you slice and dice the film clip to make things &#8220;work,&#8221; it&#8217;s cheating. MONTAGES WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.</p><footer><strong>Press Play Editors</strong> <cite><a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/the-vertigo-contest">VERTIGOED: A Press Play Mash-up Contest</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>Press Play is really a groundbreaking criticism site. If you haven’t checked out their work, Last September’s <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/IN_THE_CUT_The_Dark_Knight_by_Christopher_Nolan">IN THE CUT: The Dark Knight</a> by Jim Emerson is a good entry-point, but they’ve been up to a <em>lot</em> since.</p>
