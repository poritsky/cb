<blockquote>
  <p>AMPAS just announced emcee duties for Seth MacFarlane…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some predictions for this year’s telecast:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The theme will be old-time Hollywood glamour and also farts.</li>
  <li>MacFarlane will open with a musical number in which he schizophrenically spews the voices he’s built an empire around.</li>
  <li>There will be a lot of winking and nodding to remind us that MacFarlane isn’t a churl (like Ricky Gervais) but a company man dutifully panning his pals with kid-gloves.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t mind MacFarlane’s ubiquitous output, but I don’t get his current on-camera omnipresence. What’s the attraction? More to the point: what’s the endgame? Is this media blitz to launch the next act of his career? Or is it just another way to sell <em>Family Guy</em> box sets? It can’t be because audiences like the guy, can it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve never been very organized about watching movies. There’s a heap of films I know I should have seen by now but haven’t yet. I <em>want</em> to see these films, but it never occurs to me to seek them out. Rather, when it does occur to me that I have a gaping hole in my viewing history, I have nothing to do with that information but let it fall out of my mind. I’m trying to change that, though.</p>

<p>One of the use-cases I cooked up for <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/19/external-lists-with-omnifocus/">PlainTasksOF</a> was keeping track of films to watch. A static, plain text list could serve as a sort of dumping ground for films I need to check out someday. I’ve been experimenting how I’ll use this on a daily basis, and while I was messing around with it today, it occurred to me that it would be cool if I could quickly get to more information about the films on my list.</p>

<p>Enter Brett Terpstra’s recently <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/markdown-linking-services-with-the-google-api/">updated Lucky Link service for the Mac</a>. Brett’s service hooks into Google’s search API, allowing you to quickly create an inline Markdown link with whatever Google’s top hit is. Since it’s a Mac Service, you can link a keyboard shortcut to it, say ^⌥⌘L, and invoke it over highlighted text. That way, <code>the candler blog</code> can be turned into <code>[the candler blog](http://candlerblog.com)</code> in one tap. Neat.</p>

<p>Initially I thought I would want to create inline IMDb links on my list of movies when I realized that I had no use for keeping an IMDb URL in my document. PlainTasksOF only works in Sublime Text 2 which doesn’t currently support clickable hyperlinks, so if I added the URL it would just be dead plain text. Lame.</p>

<p>I modified Brett’s Automator workflow to open up the film page of the selected text at <a href="http://goodfil.ms/">Goodfil.ms</a>. All I did was add <code>site:goodfil.ms</code> to the search string, removed the Markdown formatting (so that the shell script only returns a URL) and added an action to open the page in the system default browser. Now, anywhere in OS X I can invoke the service to get more info about whatever film is currently highlighted as text, be it in a text document I’m working on, a web page, a tweet, a chat window, a PDF, etc.</p>

<p>Goodfil.ms seemed like a good fit for this service for a few reasons. IMDb, by far, returned the best results of any service I tested and has the added bonus of returning results for names. However, there wasn’t much one could actually <em>do</em> from an IMDb page. While the Amazon subsidiary is diligent about linking to Amazon Instant Video pages, it doesn’t really give you too many other options. The most complete service for seeking out ways to watch a film is <a href="http://www.canistream.it/">Canistream.it</a>. Unfortunately their search results are the most inconsistent of any of the sites I tried.</p>

<p>Goodfil.ms returned generally accurate results.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The real secret sauce is that if you sign into Goodfil.ms you can not only manage a film queue on the site, but you can sync it to your Netflix account. Even better, Goodfil.ms does a great job of prominently displaying when a film is available on Netflix Watch Instant or for rent on iTunes. And if that’s not enough, each film’s synopsis features links to IMDb and Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I enjoyed using it enough today that I thought I’d share it. Of course, this was all time that I should have used to watch a few movies. There’s always tomorrow…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All that talk about <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2012/09/28/death-of-cinema-reader/">the death of cinema</a> gave me a reason to once again seek out Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>. It’s all <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/107218/not-dead-just-dyinghttp://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/107218/not-dead-just-dying">David Thomson’s</a> damn fault. In his obit (or, um, get well card) for the movies, he invoked this year’s <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em> poll, the once-a-decade list to end all lists that finally (finally!) dethroned <em>Citizen Kane</em> and instead named Hitchcock’s flick as the top dog.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>My reading lists and social feeds have been flooded with takes on the <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em> list, but for whatever reason I have waited until now to actually go the video store and rent<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <em>Vertigo</em>. Thomson’s ludicrously masked cynicism (“You see how positive I am being…”) pushed me over the edge.</p>

<p>Now that it’s fresh in my mind I thought I’d share some thoughts.</p>

<p>First off: it’s a crime that there isn’t a <em>Vertigo</em> Blu-ray available right now. Everything about this film screams big screen, from Saul Bass’s iconic opening titles to the lush San Francisco scenery. Worse, <a href="http://amzn.to/QfnEDa">the best current DVD release</a> is 4:3 letterboxed as opposed to 16:9 anamorphic, meaning the pixels are presently as constrained as possible. <em>Vertigo</em> demands a higher resolution on any sized screen.</p>

<p>So there I was, trying my damndest not to compare Hitchcock to Welles, a problem I never really had before the <em>S&amp;S</em> list came out. All I could think for roughly the first 80 minutes of the film was “Is this really that much better than <em>Kane</em>?” The answer doesn’t matter because the question is, of course, flawed.</p>

<p>But then <em>Vertigo</em> becomes another film. The tale we initially settle into turns out to be a Macguffin for an altogether different type of mystery. To take an analogy a bit too far, Hitchcock not only holds his cards close to his chest, he also stacks the deck and shuffles it thrice. It’s brilliant and bold. </p>

<p>Modern films hinge heavily on twists, which tend to reveal themselves in the third act. That <em>can</em> be satisfying, but it isn’t the only way to surprise an audience. Hitchcock’s trick in <em>Vertigo</em> is to keep the audience focused squarely on the many twists built into the film while telling a wrenching tale of psychosis.</p>

<p>The reason we have become so obsessed with “Spoiler Alerts” is that so many of the films that make it to multiplexes today rely almost entirely on one or two surprises. Take them away and you are often left with nothing but a bland and straight narrative. <em>Vertigo</em> works on so many different levels that it is ostensibly spoiler-proof. No matter how many viewings you sit through, it will never be the same film twice.</p>

<p>Modern storytellers could learn a trick or two from Hitchcock’s masterwork. Hopefully, thanks to its newfound popularity, we’ll all be able to see it in an HD transfer soon.</p>

      <p>Maybe in the next round I’ll be able to participate. Or maybe by then cinema will be dead. (Finally!)<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Yes, rent. We still have thriving video stores here in Austin. I own a box-set of public domain Hitchcock films plus a copy of <em>Rope</em>.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks once again to the New York Film Academy for sponsoring this week on the candler blog.</em></p>

<p>It seems almost too easy. Where else in the world would you study filmmaking but in Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Hollywood and its environs are of course the perfect place to shoot a film, produce it, edit it and find its distributors. The best marketers, set designers, costumers, screenwriters, publicists and actors are in Los Angeles. Does that make it too easy?</p>

<p>For students in the <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/film-schools-location/los-angeles.php" rel="nofollow">LA Film School</a> of the New York Academy of Film, the word “easy” is hardly the right word. Students here aren’t messing around. They have more focus, probably, than students elsewhere because they are competing with the best. For as fun and exciting and glamorous as is Hollywood, the competition in school is fierce and not for anyone looking to kill time.</p>

<p>The children of many Hollywood luminaries attend classes at NYFA. But the vast majority of its students are working the LA boulevards of dreams, applying the best they have to one of the world’s most dynamic industries. It’s not easy – and few would expect it to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been a hot minute since someone has made the bold case for the death of cinema, by which I mean it’s an argument that’s made so often it has been rendered completely meaningless. But hey, it’s the weekend, let’s indulge anyway.</p>

<p>Cinema is merely a Schrödinger’s Cat for our philosphers to ponder. Their conclusions are inconsequential, but the conversation is a hoot. For your enjoyment, here are three articles on this moldy (although tasty) topic:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/107212/has-hollywood-murdered-the-movies">Has Hollywood Murdered The Movies?</a> by David Denby</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/107218/not-dead-just-dying">American Movies are Not Dead: They are Dying</a> by David Thomson</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/09/the-movies-are-not-dying.html#ixzz27nk9fHDY">The Movies Aren’t Dying (They’re Not Even Sick)</a> by Richard Brody</li>
</ol>

<p>I came to Denby’s and Thomson’s respective pieces by way of Brody’s. I recommend reading them in the order above so as to feel the full impact of Brody’s final word.</p>

<p>The inane fragmentation we see in TV is a boon to networks; it allows them to retain the status quo. Just look at the NFL, whose games can only be streamed to a PS3 and <em>only</em> if users also subscribe to DirecTV. Sounds open to me.</p>

<p>Dear busy businesspeople who read the Wall Street Journal: don’t listen to this clown.</p>

<p>Who makes the movie? Is it the lead actor or cast? The screenwriter? Some say it’s ultimately the editor, while for others it’s the producer. The question has no easy answer, as these roles often overlap and it varies from film to film.</p>

<p>But note that for many actors of accomplishment—think Robert Redford or Ron Howard—the path upwards leads to producing. Producers are the captains of the ship, even when the ship goes down (that’s a James Cameron joke).</p>

<p>At the New York Film Academy, the <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/producing-school/" rel="nofollow">Producing Program is among the most popular at the film school</a>. Students with more guts than experience undertake the demanding, hands-on program at the school’s New York and Los Angeles campuses. It’s a fast-paced, intensive, hands-on program that addresses the nature of selling investors through story treatments, scripting, casting, budgeting, schedules and marketing. As everyone knows, getting a distributor is everything in producing a film, and this school treats that task with proportionate attention.</p>
