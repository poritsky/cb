  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the pleasure this past week of seeing two great new Israeli films, Nadav Lapid’s <em>Policeman</em> and Joseph Cedar’s <em>Footnote</em>. The latter is Israel’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar this year and it also ran away with almost all of the 2011 Ophir Awards (the Israeli Oscar analogue). I’m not sure if <em>Policeman</em> ever came close to getting the nod for Oscar, but it was nominated for top honors alongside <em>Footnote</em> so I can’t imagine it wasn’t considered.</p>

<p>The task of selecting a film to represent a national cinema at the Oscars is a daunting one. On the one hand, you want to select a film that represents your country and the state of its film community. It is a statement, on some level, of national representation and values. On the other hand, you want to submit something that has a chance of getting nominated. Even if a film doesn’t win, the nomination helps promote a country’s movie business. So the question may as well be asked: between <em>Policeman</em> and <em>Footnote</em>, which is a better snapshot of Israel and its film community today?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Policeman</em> is a slow, haunting story that depicts the separate travails of both an anti-terrorism police officer and a small band of Israeli extremists. Through acts of violence, the one swears to protect what Israel stands for while the other vows to change it by any means necessary. The terrorists are outraged by the economic disparity in Israel, a point that should stick in any viewer’s gut when they look at the massive protests that took place in Israel this past summer and those that are ongoing on Wall Street today. It wouldn’t be such a stretch to say that Lapid’s film moved hordes of Israelis into the streets to speak out against policy they can longer abide by.</p>

<p>Cedar’s <em>Footnote</em> is a high-brow Talmudic comedy of errors, a smart take on Judeo-intellectualism and the state of modern discourse. It is a also a sweet, at times too sweet, story of a father and son. It tells the tale of two Professor Shkolniks, Eliezer and his son Uriel. Both are Talmud scholars at Hebrew University, but the son’s achievements outshine those of the father. Though its moving parts are of particular interest to a Jewish audience (there’s a nice flourish about the death of Judaism by way of Zionist machismo), its core is wholly universal. Moreover, <em>Footnote</em> doesn’t go near the ongoing military and political struggles of Israel. The only thing keeping this story in the holy land is its relationship to the Talmud. Of the two films, it’s certainly the more accessible one.</p>

<p>I think both are excellent films. In the end I have to wonder which film I would rather represent <em>me</em>, not as a Jew or on behalf of Israel, but which speaks to me and which I would like to share with others. And this is the predicament. On a technical level, I find <em>Policeman</em> the more interesting film for its deliberateness and its tackling of seemingly untouchable material. However, I wonder if I’m getting caught up in the zeitgeist of the Occupy Wall Street movement and economic unrest across the globe. In 20 years, which film will still be available and worth watching? I don’t know.</p>

<p>In the end, it is <em>Footnote</em> that the powers that be have chosen as a national champion. It’s a worthy competitor and it may well nab the Oscar spot. Make no mistake, though, <em>Policeman</em> is also a great representative of what is churning in the Israeli psyche. If you have to choose between the two films here is my advice: don’t. See both.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Michel Hazanavicius is a master of the homage. By that I mean he is an
incredibly well-versed movie nerd, approaching cinema history as gospel; the
movie house his cathedral. His latest film, <em>The Artist</em>, is a love letter to
Classical Hollywood Cinema, that bygone era since obliterated by the New
Hollywood filmmakers of the 1960s and 1970s. The film follows the travails of
a silent film actor during the rise of sound in the early 1930s and is itself
a silent film, in black and white, in the legacy 1.37:1 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>It seems there is a question as to whether or not audiences will actually go
and watch a silent film, but I think it’s a foolish thing to wonder about it.
There was a golden age of silent cinema for a reason. We have outgrown that
form but we’re not immune to enjoying it. If you can get a modern moviegoer to
sit down and watch <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> or, better, <em>The Last Laugh</em>, I think
that most people would actually have an enjoyable time. The form <em>can</em> be
timeless, but Hazanavicius offers us something much more palpable than
reminiscing over times gone by. He has given us a film that is eminently
watchable, engaging for both the armchair historian and the blockbuster-goer
alike.</p>

<p>In cinematic terms, modern conventions have allowed filmmakers and audiences
to lull into laziness. Widescreen formats, color film and bloated soundtracks
have allowed us all to neglect convention without much consequence. A terrible
cut can be corrected (or bandaged) with the right sound effect; a vertical
frame is more difficult to fill than a wide one; black and white art direction
can be more nuanced than color.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Where some may see nothing but challenges
in silent filmmaking, Hazanavicius sees opportunities. Like a blind man who
elevates his hearing, Hazanavicius’ other sensibilities congeal to become
pitch perfect. <em>The Artist</em> is an exercise in montage, a wonderful use of
imagery to tell a story that is exciting, new and repeatedly surprising.</p>

<p>I should mention the most exuberantly non-silent aspect of the film, the music
of Ludovic Bource. Much in the way that Hazanavicius is a master of cinematic
homage, Bource has composed an impeccable score that shines throughout the
film. The music rises and dips and twirls with our main character. Just like
the visuals, the music is both modern and derivative (sometimes explicitly).
It’s absolutely charming and the film would be nothing without it.</p>

<p>The question remains: will anyone actually see <em>The Artist</em>. I most certainly
hope so. At its core, it is a heartfelt film with all of the elements modern
moviegoers enjoy at the movies: love, drama, laughs and a spunky Jack Russell
Terrier who deserves an Oscar nod. If people aren’t lining up to see it, it
will be a real shame.</p>

<p>find a clip of François Truffaut speaking about widescreen formats and how it
changes how he directs actors, but I’ll have to <a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D62Uatesc">settle for this
one</a> in
which he talks briefly about color versus black and white film.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s a real shame when I tell people “I just saw a documentary about Roger
Corman” and they ask “Who?” <em>Who?</em> Somehow Corman has been pushed to the wings
of the story of American cinema. The much ballyhooed “New Hollywood” of the
1970s may never have come of age without him, yet his name has been all but
rubbed out by the stars who would outshine him. Alex Stapleton’s excellent
<em>Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel</em> aims to put the spotlight back
on the man who changed the game for generations of filmmakers.</p>

<p>Roger Corman’s greatest talent has been making movies, and I mean that in the
most literal sense. The number of films with his name attached is astounding,
perhaps approaching one thousand by this point.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Corman turned his
operation into a well-oiled machine, one that could make films in less than a
week. His goal was never to re-invent the wheel, the thing that holds up the
Stanley Kubricks and the Paul Thomas Andersons of the world, but to be able to
make as many movies that could find an audience as possible.</p>

<p>has him at 395 as producer and 56 as director (mostly overlapping), but that
doesn’t account for everything he’s touched.</p>

<p>His stylings led him to be one of the most successful B-movie and exploitation
producers of all time, but there is a lot more to him. As it turns out, he is
rather offended by his reputation as a maker of trashy camp. As Stapleton’s
film explores, his life’s work has been less about making “bad” movies and
more about making films that tap into what audiences want. Yes, that has meant
a lot of breasts and a <em>lot</em> of explosions, but also a lot of work that, even
when it was forgettable, became the training ground for some of the world’s
top talent. Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard, Jonathan Demme and Francis Ford
Coppola are just a few of the names to have found their start under Corman’s
tutelage.</p>

<p>But what of the documentary at hand? Stapleton has made a great biography of a
man who history may soon forget. Even though his work is both prolific and
extremely accessible today<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> he is still somewhat unknown among younger
generations of cinephiles. Stapleton’s film elegantly, and enjoyably, moves to
correct that. It also tries to explain it. Just as it seems the book is closed
on Corman, Stapleton introduces a new villain: Steven Spielberg. One of the
film’s conceits, sparked by those close to Corman, is that <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Star
Wars</em> represented a major shift in the way the studios went after younger
audiences. These were basically Corman movies with massive budgets, and it all
but put him out of business, or at least pushed him into obscurity.</p>

<p>Netflix Watch Instantly.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting theory, but I’m not so sure I believe it. It’s often said
that those blockbusters were the turning point, downward, for American cinema;
they’re the reason why there are nothing but loud comic book movies in
theaters today. The biggest hole in that theory is that if the studios found a
way to attract audiences with Corman-esque films, couldn’t Corman simply step
in and become <em>more</em> successful? If Stapleton trips here, it is only because
she is too enthralled with her subject.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, <em>Corman’s World</em> is an excellent watch and a damn good time. The
doc features excellent closing credits in the grindhouse vain and a number of
artistic interstitials (enjoy the poster montage). Interviews with stars big
and small, young and old make for a great Hollywood tell-all, but the best
footage comes from a wonderfully unguarded interview with Jack Nicholson. If
you love Corman, don’t miss this one; if you don’t know who he is, get your
ass to a theater and learn something.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Corman’s World</em> will be screening as part of the New York Film Festival on Sunday, October 16 and 1:30pm with a special screening of Corman’s 1962 <em>The Intruder</em> starring William Shatner.

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="updated-october-20-2011-in-the-commentshttpwwwcandlerblogcom20111011drives-judaismcomment-340157946-">⇓ Updated October 20, 2011 in the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/11/drives-judaism/#comment-340157946">comments</a>. ⇓</h2>

<p>This morning I posted a piece <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/is-drive-anti-semitic-worth-a-refund/29458">over at Heeb Magazine</a> about Sarah Deming, a Michigan woman suing FilmDistrict, distributors of Nicolas Winding Refn’s <em>Drive</em>, over being misled into seeing a film.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s a great and ridiculous story to run with from the start, but there’s more. The <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/drive-filmdistrict-lawsuit-ryan-gosling-245871">Hollywood Reporter reports</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Drive bore very little similarity to a chase, or race action film… having very little driving in the motion picture,” the suit continues. “Drive was a motion picture that substantially contained extreme gratuitous defamatory dehumanizing racism directed against members of the Jewish faith, and thereby promoted criminal violence against members of the Jewish faith.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I kept things light and funny over at Heeb, but I have to be honest, this stuff really pisses me off. I’m offended as a film lover, as an American and as a Jew. Where to begin?</p>

<p>L		et’s start with the whole misleading trailer business. This is what happens when we put all our faith in movie trailers and Rotten Tomato scores; this is what happens when our culture abandons hope that an act of cinema <em>might</em> occur when the lights go down. I’ve resisted doing trailer reviews for as long as I’ve been blogging because I know how and why they are made. Trailers are marketing tools that generally have nothing to do with the filmmaker or the final work.</p>

<p>While there is an art to cutting a trailer, it’s important to recognize that, usually, trailer editors are given a set amount of footage hand-picked by the marketing department. Sometimes they get explicit instructions how to cut the piece and often don’t get to see the whole film before they begin. That’s because trailers are a marketing tool designed to get butts in seats and that’s all. Is it misleading to put all of Drive’s action into the trailer? Not at all. You want more information before you go see it? Read a review.</p>

<p>As to the implication that <em>Drive</em> is anti-semitic, I’d counter Deming’s accusation with this argument: Refn’s film is perhaps one of the most <em>positive</em> Jewish films in 2011. There is a long history of victimization of Jews in cinema, so I’m impressed whenever I see a film that puts power in the hands of some Hebrews. The characters in question, Bernie (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) are mobsters looking to make a dent in the business of their gentile counterparts.</p>

<p>Their religion, or rather their culture, is what redeems them, what makes them worthy adversaries to Ryan Gosling’s nameless Driver. Why is Nino such a son- of-a-bitch? Because he’s been trying to make it ahead in a world where he gets called “kike” and slapped around. That backstory is what makes him relatable, what makes him something more than a throw-away baddie.</p>

<p>If that’s not enough to bring you around to liking the film then that’s fine, but don’t come out swinging with misinformed accusations because you’re annoyed. There’s plenty to hate in <em>Drive</em>. Frankly I thought the film was more violent than I expected. I even agree that there wasn’t enough driving given the film’s title. But so what? If I can’t get my money back for <em>The Scorpion King</em> then, Sarah, you can’t have your money back for <em>Drive</em>. Get a clue or stop going to the movies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Simon Curtis’s <em>My Week With Marilyn</em> is very much a Weinstein Company release. It is an impersonation romp more suited to the small screen than to the cinema. Replete with stunning performances, a corny soundtrack and uninspired technique, it is the stuff that the brothers Weinstein know how to spin into gold. And, much like <em>The King’s Speech</em> of last year, it will likely overcome its own mediocrity and dazzle awards voters all season long. It is the easiest answer to the Best Picture question.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the performances. Michelle Williams gets very close to brilliance portraying the incomparable Marilyn Monroe, a feat that shouldn’t (and won’t; see above) go uncommended. As complicated as Monroe was in her own time, her image has been Xeroxed, caricatured, overdone and parodied to death since her passing. It would be too easy for Williams to do Marilyn burlesque, a sort of recreation of the woman through her on-screen manifests. Thankfully, she becomes something more; a woman playing the part of the woman she wishes she could be.</p>

<p>The role, however, falls short of illuminating too much outside of what the dialogue spoon-feeds us. Throughout the lumbering screenplay we are told that Marilyn is a broken woman who uses up the people around her. We wait for her to pulverize our hero, the young Colin Clark played by Eddie Redmayne. Colin is the son of an aristocrat who wishes to run off and make movies, eventually landing a gig as the third assistant director on a new film by Sir Laurence Olivier starring Monroe. Olivier is played by Kenneth Branagh, a Briton who has earned a stature similar to the man he is portraying. Much like Williams, Brangh does his damnedest to sidestep farce and imbue his Olivier with only the slightest hint of homage, bringing out a spark of something more than the man we would see so many times on screen.</p>

<p>So, young Colin Clark finds himself amidst giants, with the greatest actor in the world teaming up alongside the hottest commodity in Hollywood. And he has seemingly unfettered access to both. Marilyn shows up late to set on a regular basis and is always accompanied by a cabal of handlers, the most vocal of whom is her acting coach, Paula Strasberg (Zoë Wanamaker). In a bit of backstage cleverness, this matchup of stars sets up a clash of acting styles. Monroe is fascinated by Colin who treats her as a woman instead of as a piece of meat. And so the two frolic for a fleeting period, at the expense of Colin’s untimely meet-cute with a wardrobe girl, Lucy (Emma Watson).</p>

<p>Since the Curtis is winkingly telling a tale of the filmmaking process (method acting’s rise, on-set union clashes, a new age of celebrity worship, etc.) perhaps it would have done him some good to revisit Syd Field or even Aristotle. The story is shoddy and the characters learn nothing. Worse, very little is at stake for our young hero who is forced to choose between beautiful and most beautiful. An aristocrat trying to make a name for himself <em>can</em> be a compelling story, but in this case Colin has so little to lose we have no reason to care. His love of Monroe never transcends schoolboy infatuation, yet we are expected to believe him when he asks the starlet to run away together. It’s going to take a lot more than charm and sweater-vests to bark up that tree.</p>

<p>With all this talk of story, I should perhaps be lambasting screenwriter Adrian Hodges, but I’m not so sure that’s where things first went wrong. There are a lot of elements of the story that <em>could</em> work and play instead as missed opportunities. The culture clash of actors abroad and the mental state of a young Monroe (before <em>Some Like it Hot</em>, before Kennedy) are brilliant fodder for a great story. All of the pieces are there on screen but they never cohere into something that goes beyond lecturing; they never form together to make cinema.</p>

<p>The fault then, I suspect, should lie with director Simon Curtis, but perhaps there is more at work here. I can’t get over how similar this film feels to <em>The King’s Speech</em>. Stylistically on almost every count, even down to those damned wide lenses, <em>Marilyn</em> mimics the prior film. Can it be, then, that the Weinsteins are to blame? Harvey has a long history of watering down films in order to land an Oscar, but I think that process has now flipped around, inviting filmmakers to keep their aspirations in check and take the easiest route possible. It’s a real shame, because there’s a great story trying to break through here, with a world-class cast dying to do good. Unfortunately, it never comes together into something more than “just okay.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Netflix is making it real hard for customers to keep cool and stay confident that they know what the hell they are doing. After botching a summer price hike, confusing customers and initiating an exodus of 1 million customers, CEO Reed Hastings came out and made a large-scale public apology last month while announcing a new DVD-only company called Qwikster, turning Netflix proper into a streaming only service. Today, Hastings is backtracking. In a <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/10/dvds-will-be-staying-at-netflixcom.html">blog post</a>, he succinctly lets us know that Qwikster is canceled and that Netflix will remain unchanged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult, so we are going to keep Netflix as one place to go for streaming and DVDs.</p>

  <p>This means no change: one website, one account, one password… in other words, no Qwikster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was uneasy about the price hike, and frustrated by the Qwikster announcement, but I understood it and <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/09/19/qwikster-cometh/">gave Netflix the benefit of the doubt</a>. Now, not so much. Now, I’m pissed.</p>

<p>Whenever I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/?s=reed+hastings&x;=0&y;=0">write about Reed Hastings</a>, I tend to paint him in a visionary light, and it’s all well deserved. He upended an entire industry and built a company with incredible customer service. However, Reed has never been tested like he has this year. I think it’s now safe to say that he failed.</p>

<p>Customers wanted to be reassured that the company they love wasn’t going to screw them. That’s what Reed’s Qwikster announcement was all about. He said all the right things in a tone people can respect. He put his foot down and said the company is going to take a major chance. Netflix bet the farm on the future.</p>

<p>Less than a month later the entire plan is undone. What new information could there possibly be after a few weeks that Hastings and company couldn’t foresee when they set this up?</p>

<p>Let’s pretend that they are responding to the biggest customer complaint regarding managing two different queues and ratings/reviews accounts. That functionality was expressly explained by Hastings in his announcement. If they didn’t see it as a problem until after the Qwikster announcement, what else are they missing?</p>

<p>There is the unlikely possibility that all of this was actually a smart move. Perhaps (and that’s a big <em>perhaps</em>) Netflix was trying to wave a big stick in the face of the studios, to let them know that if they don’t get serious about making streaming pacts they are willing to break up the company at the studios’ expense. The metrics of this conspiracy theory don’t entirely add up, but that’s the only positive explanation I can think up for these erratic moves.</p>

<p>Reed, you fucked up in July. Then you fixed it in September. Now you fucked up again.</p>

<p>The only olive branch left to offer customers is a price cut or at least a rebate of some sort. Look at how Apple dealt with “antenna-gate”. They never admitted culpability, but they spent some money on free bumpers so that they could sell a ton more iPhones and restore confidence in the company.</p>

<p>I have little confidence that Netflix has a clear vision for the future anymore. I doubt I’m alone. It’s time to win back customers and quit shooting from the hip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People keep saying that the iPhone 4S is an iterative bump while the next big iPhone redesign will be released in 2012 under the name iPhone 5. Wouldn’t it actually be an iPhone 6? Dig:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2007: iPhone</li>
  <li>2008: iPhone 3G</li>
  <li>2009: iPhone 3GS</li>
  <li>2010: iPhone 4</li>
  <li>2011: iPhone 4S</li>
</ul>

<p>The next iPhone will in fact be the 6th iPhone model ever.</p>

<p>Apple didn’t do themselves any favors by naming their second phone “3G”. Almost every non-tech nerd I know doesn’t realize that there is a difference between the 3G and the 3GS and most call last year’s model the iPhone 4G. It’s the most confusing naming convention in Apple’s lineup.</p>

<p>I hope they move to a different convention before the next phone comes out. Perhaps make the flagship iPhone an iPhone Pro and flip the iPhone 4S to just plain iPhone and leave the iPhone 3GS as 3GS until it goes out of production.</p>

<p>I don’t know where they’ll take things next, but iPhone 5 is numerically inconsistent and iPhone 6 is just confusing. Gotta change the name eventually.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With regards to privacy, because all of your web requests will go through the cloud, your surfing will effectively be fully anonymous — target websites will see Amazon’s IP addresses, not yours. If you’re worried about Amazon sniffing your data, though, you can turn off “EC2 acceleration” in the browser’s settings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you want to have a fast (and I’m guessing in the case of the Kindle Fire, serviceable) browsing experience, you have to give your browsing habits over to Amazon? The plus is that then your IP address is anonymized through Amazon’s EC2.</p>

<p>It’s going to be interesting to see how Amazon approaches user privacy as these things roll off the presses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>I’m being a little tin-foil-hat-devil’s-advocate about this. I’m sure Amazon’s intentions are pure and I’ll bet they’ve built a cool browser that works quickly on a low-powered device. There are some privacy questions worth asking, though.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning, Amazon announced a whole new lineup of Kindle e-readers as well
as the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Color-Multi-touch-
Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2">Kindle Fire</a>, their take on a media centric tablet. One of
their major innovations is the Fire’s web browser, dubbed Silk. In short,
Amazon offloads page loading to their Amazon Web Services (AWS) allowing sites
to appear super-fast on your Fire. Here is Amazon’s
<a href="http://amazonsilk.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/introducing-amazon-
silk/">explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/09/amazon-
silk/">The Brooks Review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon has just given every web developer a way to make incredible fast and
targeted sites for the Kindle Fire. That’s clever. That’s a company that gets
it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Christopher at <a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/2011/09/28
/introducing-amazon-silk-read-another-new-browser/">Monday By Noon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t like this trend. As a front end developer, to do my job respectably,
I should have appropriate versions of modern Web browsers for testing
purposes. That’s all well and good on the software end, browsers are free.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trouble comes in when you need to buy a piece of hardware for the sake
of running a free piece of software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brooks is coming at this as a user while Christopher is looking at it as a
developer, so it’s unsurprising that they’re saying the exact opposite thing.
The fear is that every tablet maker will start making a custom-built browser
with new standards and new problems. The fact is, however, that no one but
Amazon has this kind of vertical ability. CEO Jeff Bezos put it best when
<a href="http://live.thisismynext.com/Event/Amazon_Tablet_eve
nt_live_blog?Page=2">talking about AWS today</a>, <strong>“In terms of market share, Amazon is Coke and there
isn’t yet a Pepsi.”</strong> Zing.</p>

<p>No one but Amazon can deploy a cloud-based browser like Silk on this scale
except Amazon, at least not today. Still, Jonathan does have a point. The more
browsers, the more devices, the harder it becomes to program and design sites.
But, to Ben’s point, if it makes for a better user experience, then who cares?</p>

<p>Personally, I’d be more concerned with the privacy implications of Silk. Every
Kindle is linked to an Amazon account, which means it <em>has</em> to be linked to a
Credit Card, which means your real identity is linked to your device. Now
every site you visit is cached on Amazon’s drives? It better be some fast
browser to make that tradeoff worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to hear Roger Ebert in conversation with A.O. Scott at the New York Times TimesCenter last night. He is touring to promote his
new book, <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2011/08/i_was_born_inside_the_movie_of. html"><em>Life Itself</em></a>. It was an enlightening and, at
times, moving discussion between the two critics, rife with bits of inside cinema humor that I love. Note that I didn’t say inside
Hollywood. Ebert loathes celebrity gossip and insider chit-chat. For him, it’s just about what’s on the screen.</p>

<p>Ebert has been functioning without his jaw since 2006 after he underwent surgery to treat thyroid cancer. For public appearances, he
types on a laptop and then hits a button to let it speak for him.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The result is something spectacular. Ebert has worn many hats over
the years, perhaps most popularly as a TV personality. His main calling, however, is as a <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/">prolific
writer</a>. Watching Ebert speak <em>is</em> watching him write.</p>

<p>He clacks away on the keyboard, sometimes pausing to reconsider his thoughts and often mousing around to correct typos. When he hits the
play, he uses his eyes and hands to accompany the words as they come out. Sometimes, he mimics what he would be doing if he had his own
voice. Other times, he is clearly performing, hamming up his gestures to make sure the people in the cheap seats catch his wit. Whenever
he had something to say and didn’t want A.O. Scott to move onto another topic, he would raise a hand, often to comic effect. Once he
even smacked the table to keep A.O. from changing the subject. As readers of his reviews, tweets and blog posts know, Ebert hasn’t
actually lost his voice; he has just repurposed it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best moments of the evening occurred when Ebert put Scott in the hot seat. When Scott brought up Ebert’s vociferous campaign
against 3-D, the Sun-Times critic explained that the technology is a waste (“Maybe one or two movies a year, but I’ve seen enough Pandas
doing kung-fu.”) and that no critic has made a decent justification argument for it. Then, with a sharp look to his moderator, his
computer asked “You’re not seriously telling me you like 3D, are you?” Scott didn’t offer a defense, but tried to convince Ebert that
Wim Wenders’ forthcoming 3-D dance documentary, <em>Pina</em>, shows an extension of the form. “Maybe,” he answered. He also copped to liking
Werner Herzog’s <em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</em>, another 3-D documentary.</p>

<p>Later, the two brought up the topic of streaming films. Ebert is a big advocate of streaming media as it can connect audiences to cinema
faster than ever. He often recommends films to watch on Netflix and YouTube via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ebertchicago">Twitter</a>, and he
loves watching movies on his <a href="http://www.roku.com/">Roku</a> box. “What do you think of the quality of streaming movies?” Ebert asked
Scott. It’s an interesting question the two didn’t spend too much time boring the audience with, though Scott did explain the films he
watches online run the gamut from “smeary” VHS quality to crisp HD. He also noted that it’s often unclear which version of a film you’ll
be watching on streaming services, whether it will be letterbox or pan-and-scan or be dubbed instead of subtitled. They agreed that
streaming standards are nowhere near the standards of DVDs, but perhaps it will get there someday.</p>

<p>One joke that didn’t quite get the laugh it deserved was one that Roger made after a video from his acceptance into the Directors Guild
of America played. “Now that I’m in the DGA, I can sign my bad reviews Alan Smithee.” A.O. cracked up but forgot to clue the audience in
(though frankly, I thought the crowd would have gotten it). An anagram for “the alias men,” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Smithee">Alan Smithee</a> is a pseudonym directors traditionally use for films that they feel have been
corrupted by the Hollywood system, a work they wouldn’t want to put their name on. A geeky reference, but that’s who Ebert is.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of Ebert’s most endearing qualities is his simple pragmatism. Unlike some other elder critics, he is incredibly supportive
of younger, amateur critics coming into the fold. He loves the expanding discussion of movies. He noted that print is still his favorite
medium, but that since the internet is boundless, there is plenty of room for more criticism and discussion. Instead of deriding critics
like myself who set up a home online, he lauds them. “In fact,” Ebert posited, looking around the TimesCenter, “I bet there are a number
of great internet critics in this room right now.”</p>

<p>When asked, as his last question, what he would tell an up and coming critic who wants to be the next Roger Ebert, he left the audience
with a warm-hearted answer. “Don’t be the next Roger Ebert, be the first you.” It’s straightforward, eloquent, inarguable, a bit corny
and easy to remember. In other words, it’s a classic piece of Ebert’s prose.</p>
