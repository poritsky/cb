  <div class="entry-content"><p>his “confession” that <a href="http://www.thefix.com/content/confessions-plagiarist-Quentin-rowan9278?page=all">went up on The Fix</a> today is the first I’m hearing about outed plagiarist Quentin Rowan. Under the pseudonym Q.R. Markham, he has been a rising star in the literary world culminating with the publication of his spy novel, <em>Assassin of Secrets</em>, a few weeks ago. It turns out that none of his writing was original, but lifted from a multitude of sources.</p>

<p>In his confession, Rowan tries to explain away his misdeeds, branding plagiarism an addiction that replaced his alcoholism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They call a person like me a Plagiarist. It’s one of the harsher words we have in our language. Perhaps not up there with Pedophile or Rapist, but not as far behind as you’d think either. For years, I’d been dreading being called that word, and marveled all the while that I’d somehow avoided being caught.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, his original writing is pretty terrible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some months after my first [AA] meeting a poem I’d written in high school was picked for the <em>Best American Poetry</em> anthology. I was 19. My ego had already left the building. I should have been at my happiest, getting into my studies and <strong>rejoicing at the blowjob heaven of youth and possibility in those playground groves of academe</strong>. Instead, I spent sleepless nights trying to recapture whatever oddball inspiration I’d had that landed me in the Anthology. (Emphasis mine.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My eyes don’t roll back far enough. I’ll concede that Rowan has a problem and is in need of help, but that’s no excuse for his actions. He committed a crime, a grave one. He will get no sympathy from me.</p>

<p>The whole affair got me thinking about a session I attended at SXSW in March called “<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_FP7446">The Blogger Centipede: How Content is Eroding Credibility</a>.” I wrote a <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/03/16/parsing-out-the-techcrunchmoviefone-debacle/">little bit</a> about it back when it was fresh. The panel was an illustrious group of movie bloggers including <a href="http://twitter.com/akstanwyck">Anne Thompson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/misterpatches">Matt Patches</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/williambgoss">William Goss</a>. In the audience was most of the top- tier online film writers working today. It was a formidable set of professionals who are deadly serious about this business.</p>

<p>The session was about how cribbing content hurts us all; it was basically an intro to not plagiarizing, or how not to be a jerk online. When things moved to Q &amp; A, a woman in the front of the room, who apparently hadn’t been listening too well, asked, “If you could plagiarize anyone, who would it be?” The panel was aghast; the audience groaned. Was she for real? She kept trying to rephrase the same question: who would you steal from if you knew you wouldn’t get caught? The answer, of course, is no one. Plagiarizing other writers undermines the whole concept of writing, and those of us who attended the session were (mostly) people committed to foisting our own opinions on others.</p>

<p>For these many months I’ve given this questioner the benefit of the doubt, assuming that what she meant to say was, “If you had the ability to write as well as any one writer, who would it be?” Now, though, reading Quentin Rowan’s lame defense, I wonder if she meant exactly what she said. Perhaps she was voicing a point of view that comes from the scuzzy underbelly of internet culture, the <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/10/film-critic-apologizes-for-epic-plagiarism-will-continue-to-rev/">same place that led to the panel</a> in the first place. Is the taboo of plagiarism eroding? Is it actually becoming hip to do a veritable super-cut of other writers’ words? If you can tweet a quote and a link, why not blog a quote instead? Why not the whole article? It’s just aggregation, right?</p>

<p>The gap between the standup internet citizen and the internet plagiarist is getting smaller. Rowan is now the poster child for plagiarism, but how long until he is viewed as a rock star? He was anything but lazy, which is why his crimes went unnoticed for so long. Sadly, I wonder if there isn’t a surge of new writers who will be comfortable lifting work from writers far better than themselves.</p>

<p>That woman at SXSW may be one of many who have had right and wrong jumbled up for them. I hope that’s not the case, that everyone can see Rowan and his ilk for what they are: charlatans and thieves. The gift of the Internet is that so many voices can contribute to an unending international conversation. There’s no room left for copycats.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mark Harris for <a href="http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/38285/oscarmetrics-is-best-actress-a-lesser-award">Grantland</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a problem here, but it’s a problem with the Academy Awards only insofar as the Oscars reflect a self-perpetuating catastrophe within the movie business: The belief that men star in movies, but women star in “women’s movies.” Treated as an irksome niche by their own industry, actresses have to settle for lower budgets and shakier financing, which means that the films for which they get nominated are more likely to be underdeveloped performance showcases than richly conceived and produced movies with top-of-the-line talent in all creative and technical areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with Harris’s take on some of the films he’s talking about, but this piece contains some fine data points regarding women in movies before it unravels into general awards season punditry. He fails to conclude anything, but rather leaves the question open to the rest of us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Roberts for <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-feds-play-movie-industry-messages-on-seized-websites-legality-unclear/">Paid Content</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FBI and Homeland Security announced the latest seizures in exultant <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/28/feds_seize_130_sites_ in_cyber_monday_crackdown/">press releases</a> lauding the eighth phase of the “Operation In Our Sites” campaign under which the federal government is seizing the names of websites that sell counterfeit merchandise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, the Feds are cracking down on film piracy by seizing Web sites that seem to have nothing to do with film piracy based on a 1970 anti-drug law. Also, they’re redirecting to a dubious PSA instead of unloading the seized URLs. Here it is.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6YScoXn31Mg "></iframe></div>

<p>This is a gross misrepresentation of who piracy hurts. Film piracy hurts the executives at multi-national conglomerates and above-the-line talent with residual contracts. A boom operator? Gimme a break. This distorts the matter to the point of disbelief. They’re screwing it up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My favorite moment in <em>Hugo</em> didn’t even come from the film itself, but a different film altogether. As Harold Lloyd dangled high above Los Angeles from the hand of a clock in the 1923 film <em>Safety First</em>, the children in the theater I was in became dead silent, gasping along with Lloyd’s comedic feat. Silent cinema of yesteryear is, in fact, timeless. There is a magic that can happen when the lights go down. If nothing else, director Martin Scorsese wants to share this one lesson with a new generation in his 3-D fantasia. Boy, does he ever deliver.</p>

<p><em>Hugo</em> is about a boy, Hugo Cabret, left to fend for himself running the clocks in a Parisian train station. It is also about a machine, a small mechanical boy, that he is trying to repair. But really, it is about the power and wonder of the movies. This isn’t too surprising coming from Scorsese, who has spent the years after his initial rise to prominence trying to understand and chronicle his chosen medium. From his epic “A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies” to his more recent “A Letter to Elia,” to his appearance in seemingly every moviemaking documentary of the last decade, always in his signature plush screening room chair, he has made it his life’s work to pay homage to those who came before him. This latest film shows not only an impressive honing of the director’s own technical acumen, but also an expansion of his educational efforts. As it turns out, this love letter to early silent film is a kids movie, intended for today’s youth who have sensory stimulation coming out their ears. That’s why I was blown away when my audience, who might be as comfortable watching <em>Transformers</em> or <em>Real Steel</em>, perked up while watching an 88 year-old Harold Lloyd clip.</p>

<p>The film itself isn’t perfect. It suffers from being a bit too precious, with a plot that sometimes lumbers along too slowly, puzzle pieces fitting into one another too perfectly. Overall though, this story of a boy and an aging, forgotten filmmaker provides sturdy scaffolding on which Scorsese is able to play with light. The 3-D is astounding, very different from the one-note eye- pokery that has served as the technology’s making and undoing. Bobbing and weaving through the train station feels natural, enhanced by the addition of 3-D instead of bogged down by it.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a shot to point to that proves the legitimacy of 3-D (besides those in Noel Paul’s excellent 2010 short <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/03/17/candlercast-15-talking-indie-3d-with-noel-paul/"><em>Annie Goes Boating</em></a>) it would be the moment we enter the library of film studies. The geometry of the establishing shot, which is fleeting, is impeccable even for 2-D work. We view the room from above, soaking in an enormous amount of depth even as the floor is soaked in fresh sunlight. Screen right, the expanse’s perfection is broken by a wooden banister that shoots off along the z-axis into oblivion. This upper level banister is the 3-D element that makes the scene something more than can be accomplished with traditional filmmaking processes. It is Hitchcock’s lamps in <em>Dial M for Murder</em>; it is Grace Kelly’s outstretched arm. This and so many other flourishes in <em>Hugo</em> justify the format. I only hope it stays around long enough for more artists to come along and take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Scorsese has made so many films in so many styles, it is hard to say where this one falls in his canon. Is it a masterpiece? Probably not. But is it a 3-D masterpiece? Yes. In fifty years when repertory theaters (may they still exist) do 3-D retrospectives, <em>Hugo</em> will be on the program. Maybe even some teenage movie buffs will say, “Whoa, Martin Scorsese, who, like, was famous because he made <em>The Departed</em>, made a 3-D movie?” It’s a film that moves us forward. Better yet, it gets young audiences today a reason to revisit the great early filmmakers of the silent era. That is a feat only a master could pull off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know, I love <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/20/my-text-problem/">playing with text editors</a>. Information Architects’ <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> has been one of the more mesmerizing apps available for both iPad and the Mac. Its core feature is a beautiful monospaced typeface from Bold Monday called <a href="http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti_overview">Nitti Light</a>. Beyond that, Writer sells itself based its lack of features. You can’t change the font size, color scheme or page width. It’s the distraction-free writing software worth a <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1169153343/only-you">Merlin Mann lampoon</a>.</p>

<p>Though I own both versions of Writer, I rarely find myself writing in it because of its many limitations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> However, there’s a new feature that is pretty damn cool in the latest update: iCloud syncing. Only a handful of developers have figured out how to implement Apple’s new iCloud service and iA Writer is the first writing app to add it. For as long as plain text editors have exploded into a cottage industry on iOS, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> has been the de facto file syncing solution. Writer proves that iCloud might, <em>might</em> give Dropbox a run for its money.</div>

<p>Legend <em>had</em> it that the seminal song was written on cocktail napkins in Saratoga Springs, New York.</p>

<p>Not only was I smitten to find out that the song was actually written in Philadelphia, where I hail from, but the song’s first performance was at my alma mater. Take that, New York.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I made it home for Thanksgiving, one of the first orders of business, of course, was to go to the movies. Foregoing the madness of the mall multiplexes on a busy night, instead I went to a showing of <em>The Descendants</em> at <a href="http://www.countytheater.org/">The County Theater</a>, a great little repertory/art- house spot in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Living in New York City, it is so rare that I get to see a 35mm print of a new film anymore. The major chains and even most smaller houses have flipped to digital. So I was dismayed when the trailers at The County started running on a digital projector. Then, this came on:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/30800771 "></iframe></div>

<p>In the video, the theater’s director, John Toner, explains that The County must make the move to digital in order to keep up with the industry. As a non- profit, they need donations to be able to convert their auditoriums and are asking audiences for help.</p>

<p>The video is low quality, probably originally standard definition. Projected on a movie screen it looks absolutely terrible. I mean no disrespect to Toner or the person who shot this, but seeing this video swirled me down into the same digital depression I’ve been feeling for the last few years. I want to move forward and believe that the perks of digital distribution (better access to films, cleaner viewing experience, better longevity for popular “prints,” etc.) outweigh the charm of projected film. It’s been so long since I’ve seen a brand new 35mm film, I thought I had gotten over my “woe is me, projection luddite” phase. To think, <em>this</em> is what they want to convert The County to? This looks awful!</p>

<p>Of course, the actual projector they need funds to purchase will look much better. It looks bad because, well, it is. Digital is the future, get over yourself, Jon.</p>

<p>Then, the projector switched and a film print of Alexander Payne’s film unfurled. I was crushed. The print looked stunning. The crisp edges of Hawaiian life nearly cut right through the screen. The colors popped out at me as no digital projector has been able to. The film itself <em>spoke</em> to me on a level I’ve become unaccustomed to lately. This is the splendor of 35mm projections and its days are numbered.</p>

<p>I wish only the best for The County and I hope they are able to fulfill their campaign. A theater must keep up with emerging technologies, and the best argument I’ve heard for digital projection is that it removes the friction of bringing the great movies of the world to towns that otherwise wouldn’t bother getting them. That is just as important as my unhealthy relationship with celluloid.</p>

<p>Before this relic of movie-watching is lost forever, do yourself a favor and go seek out a theater that has 35mm on the menu. If you’re near Bucks County, PA, The County Theater is a wonderful place to catch a movie. The U.S. is peppered with great little theaters whose hand will be forced to move into the future. Don’t miss out on the past while it’s still around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this year, I helped my dad to get new laptops for himself and my mother. I tried talking them into getting Macs or iPads, but they balked with the usual refrains. “If I worked on creative things…They’re so much money…I know you just like them, but I don’t want to learn another thing…” Bargain basement prices for the devil you know is tough to argue against. So we got in the car and went to buy laptops.</p>

<p>Best Buy may as well be a Salvation Army thrift store when it comes to buying computers. You can’t hope for too much in terms of style or sustainability. And service? Forget about it. My dad walked in the door knowing the model of machine he wanted, and we still spent hours there while the staff tried, in vain, to figure out how to take our money. There was scanning this and formatting that and searching for the free printer he was promised.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>“Does it come with Office?” my dad asked. The blank-faced customer service rep looked at the box, as we had. “Oh yeah, definitely, says it right there.” Sure enough, there was a nice bright Microsoft Office logo on the box. My father wanted the machine to get some work done at home, and Office is a must. Like most people, my parents still believe that if you want to use Office at all you need a Windows Machine. If this plastic Toshiba laptop says it has Office on the box then it surely does, right? Wrong.</p>

<p>As it turns out, in 2011, Microsoft still ships a stripped down version of Office on new Windows machines. This version is ad-supported and barely works. In other words, it isn’t Office at all. It’s shit. Good sport that he is, my dad opened his wallet again and dropped $119 on Microsoft Office Home Edition. As it said on his Amazon order, “3PC/1 User.” Great, he’s only got two PCs, so it should install on both. But it doesn’t. Instead, he’s expected to buy two seats for his household.</p>

<p>Microsoft: <strong>go to hell</strong>.</p>

<p>There may well be a proper workaround that my father fumbled on. Perhaps he bought the wrong UPC, or maybe he clicked a wrong button when installing. Guess what? I don’t care. You still managed to fuck up the simplest bit of your core business, selling software. If you can’t sell software to my dad, you don’t deserve to sell it to anyone.</p>

<p>This is why I left Windows behind ten years ago<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is why I left Word behind ages ago and haven’t even noticed. I’m not a Mac user because I want to look cool in coffee shops. I’m a Mac user because I believe in straightforward computing. I want something that does what it says on the tin. Microsoft still relies on false marketing and blatant trickery to make a buck. So it can go to hell.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, when it became clear that I would be writing for more than one outlet, I bought <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> and it became my go-to app for organizing the disparate strands of my writing. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made. That people spend $140 for Word in a world where Scrivener exists is absolutely insane; it’s 20x the app and a third of the price.</p>

<p>One of the side effects of using Scrivener was learning how to write in MultiMarkdown.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> At first, the plain text syntax confounded me, so I bugged the Scrivener developers on their (incredibly useful) forums until I started to get the hang of it. Shortly thereafter, the iPad came out and plain text documents became “a thing” again, with Markdown the preferred language for composing richly formatted documents on the go. The only problem? Scrivener doesn’t work directly with text documents.</p>

<p>Over the past year I have moved away from Scrivener. Instead I’ve tried to create a workflow based solely around text documents I organize in folders. It has been, to say the least, a struggle. The trouble with Scrivener (actually one of its strengths, unless you’re fiddly) is that it organizes all of the documents you are working on as RTFs within the current .scriv project. Not only are those documents RTF, they are inaccessible to other editors.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I’ve been buying text editors for Mac OS X and iOS in hopes of finding “the one” that fits my workflow. On the iPad, I’m pretty happy with <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/02/daedalus-touch-brings-beautiful-text-editing-to-the-ipad/">Daedalus</a>. Lately on the iPhone WriteRoom has been my main writing app. On the Mac? I flip-flop. A lot. Sometimes I’m in the mood for Byword, which features excellent writer-centric Markdown syntax highlighting and keyboard shortcuts. Other times I’m into the enormous (like, 36px enormous) beauty of iA Writer’s typography. When it’s time to get serious about editing a document, TextMate does an excellent job of filling the screen with all of my nonsense. Plus I love <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/07/some-writeroom-3-0-themes/">changing all the themes</a> in the fullscreen wonder that is WriteRoom. But guess what? I miss Scrivener.</p>

<p>I should probably talk about the elephant in the “I wish I had a text only version of Scrivener” room: Ulysses. This app, made by the same folks behind Daedalus, gets very close to providing me with the kind of structured madness I need. It predates Scrivener and paved the way for this kind of editor.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Not only does Ulysses work with text documents but it also features a kind of syntax highlighting that is extremely customizable. Big plusses! The trouble is that there is no easy way to incorporate the basics of Markdown into Ulysses. You can get very close, but it takes some investment to set it up and then falls short on some nifty conventions that are available in other apps.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Beyond that, the text documents you edit in Ulysses are kept within a .ulys document, just like Scrivener’s .scriv, so again you’re stuck editing within one app. Worse, currently there is no real document sync. It’s easy enough to export your current work for editing on an iPad, but getting it back into Ulysses is tricky.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, you either completely agree with my frustrations or think I sound like the kind of person who writes messages in poop on his basement walls.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The truth is that I find myself comfortable using many tools given my changing moods and needs. This is why plain text documents are so brilliant. There are an endless number of apps and devices you can use to edit text. Better, it’s simple to share with others and can be turned into just about any other kind of document you like. Getting fiddly is part of my process. Given the market for text editors out there, I gather I’m not alone.</p>

<p>So what does my perfect text editing app look like? Well, it actually looks like a version of Scrivener that edits text documents located within my Mac’s filesystem. I love that I can keep my documents organized in Scrivener and scribble notes into a sidebar. I love being able to do things like change the color of documents in the “binder” or view my documents in an outline or “corkboard” view. I can get pretty close to all of that by using projects in TextMate or Espresso or Sublime Text or BBEdit, but not close enough.</p>

<p>I know, I have a problem with text. But I’m working on it.</p>
