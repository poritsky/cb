  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nick Bilton over at <em>The New York Times</em> (who I <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/01/22/the-flawed-logic-behind-the-internet-time-slot/">criticized</a> way before it was cool) was on the receiving end of some harsh words this week after his June 19th blog post, “<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/microsoft-surface-allows-people-to-create/">Microsoft Surface Allows People to Create</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPad, for all its glory, suffers from one very distinct flaw: It’s very difficult to use for creation. The keyboard on the screen, although pretty to look at, is abysmal for typing anything over 140 characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple bloggers, naturally, took Bilton to task. After all, his Apple slags came in the reflected praise he was heaping on Microsoft’s just-announced Surface tablet. At best, Bilton’s piece was a crock. Take his closing line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet many budget-conscious consumers who pass on the iPad and go for a computer instead may now have a choice to buy a device that doubles as both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft has kept mum on Surface’s pricing, so either he’s got a real source (in which case he should commit some journalism and report on it) or he’s just making shit up. I’ll put my money on the latter. </p>

<p>Yesterday he responded to the criticism in another post, “<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/when-apple-fanboys-attack/">When Zealots Attack</a>.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Here’s Nick’s defense of his iPad-isn’t-for-creation stance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I absolutely love typing on my iPhone, where I can pummel my thumbs at the screen with the speed of Superman and the accuracy of an Olympic archer. But, for me, typing long form on the iPad is much more difficult. Maybe it’s a simple problem of the keyboard design on the iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others have pointed out in great detail how many people have used the iPad for creating artwork, music, books and so forth. But Nick doesn’t use his iPad for any of that, so it isn’t a creation device <em>for him</em>.</p>

<p>Which is all well and good, only that’s not what he said in his original post. Where does Bilton let us know that he is offering a personal opinion when he says things like “The keyboard…is abysmal” and “Apple doesn’t seem to want the iPad to be a creator”? He can’t have it both ways, wrapping opinions up as facts on a Tuesday and then explaining what he meant on a Friday.</p>

<p>So Bilton is trying on the “Apple Fanboys are mean” defense. Hell, he even tried an anti-corporate approach…<em>to back up a piece he wrote about a Microsoft product</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But guys, these are products. They are products we buy, with our own money, from Apple — a company that makes a very hefty profit from those transactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn’t get it. What he did this week was chip away not only at his own credibility but also at that of the publication he writes for. This wasn’t journalism, it was a cheap attempt at link-bait (which worked, twice), the kind of bullshit we’ve gotten used to over at <em>Business Insider</em> and <em>The Huffington Post</em>.</p>

<p>So Nick, I don’t think you’re an idiot, but you sure acted like one this week. Now do you have anything original to write for America’s paper of record, or are you just going to clack out the first idea that comes to you? That is, if there’s a Surface nearby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chris [Walken], he, I think was eager, as I was told, to play a human being. He is cast in so many larger than life sorts of characters. He wanted to play something that was more grounded. And so he embraced the toupée and the change in his eyes and muting him, turning him into a sort of regular kind of guy. I mean his face is powerful and iconic as it is so I was all about restraining that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend Emily White, a twenty year-old intern at NPR’s <em>All Songs Considered</em>, wrote a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2012/06/16/154863819/i-never-owned-any-music-to-begin-with">blog post defending her music library</a>, which contains over 11,000 songs she mostly hasn’t paid for.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, David Lowery published a <a href="http://thetrichordist.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/letter-to-emily-white-at-npr-all-songs-considered/">devastating, 4000 word response</a> to her post over at The Trichordist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also find this all this sort of sad. Many in your generation are willing to pay a little extra to buy “fair trade” coffee that insures the workers that harvested the coffee were paid fairly. Many in your generation will pay a little more to buy clothing and shoes from manufacturers that certify they don’t use sweatshops. Many in your generation pressured Apple to examine working conditions at Foxconn in China. Your generation is largely responsible for the recent cultural changes that has given more equality to same sex couples. On nearly every count your generation is much more ethical and fair than my generation. Except for one thing. Artist rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Piracy is the third rail on blogs, but Lowery injects the conversation with a healthy dose of humanity, an element usually lacking from these sorts of diatribes.</p>

<p>Read the whole thing. It’ll make you want to buy an album or five.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Austin Lindberg <a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/siri-integration-explained-how-apples-eyes-free-feature-will-work/">reporting for <em>Car and Driver</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to first point out that Siri is a software change, both for the car and the phone, and not one that affects hardware—existing voice-command buttons will be used to access the system through a Bluetooth connection. According to an engineer we spoke to, Apple’s software development includes a refinement in how Siri deals with high amounts of background noise—the in-car’s single mic can pick up road, wind, and engine noise that makes it difficult for Siri to comprehend commands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the idea of a Siri-enabled car. Apple and app developers are much nimbler than car manufacturers. If all the carmakers have to do is change the way their bluetooth button actuates, it could open up the in-car software landscape completely.</p>

<p>The same article has Chevy and Mercedes boasting they can add the integration by year’s end if not early 2013. Their sources seem excited to get this working.</p>

<p>Readability is now a free service, and they’re trying to figure out what to do with $150,000 of unclaimed funds earmarked for publishers. The comments on Richard’s post quickly turned into a riot.

<p>I interviewed Ziade back when <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/03/06/richard-ziade-interview/">Readability’s iOS app debuted</a> and again with the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/25/richard-ziade-on-readlists/">release of Readlists</a>. While many people may be relieved the pay service is over, since it clearly became a second-class citizen once the service became free earlier this year, this backlash is sure to persist at least for a few weeks. But then what?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the <a href="http://hyperbolic.tv/podcasts/backlot/episode-2/">second episode of “The Backlot,”</a> Ryan and I discussed the E3 announcements of this past week and the rumors and expectations for next week’s Apple WWDC keynote presentation. There’s a lot swirling around about what Apple’s next move might be, but I think a lot of it is just noise.</p>

<p>Remember, just last week CEO <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3051521/tim-cook-apple-will-double-down-on-secrecy-on-products/in/2815737">Tim Cook said</a>, “We’re going to double down on secrecy on products.” I think that’s proving to be quite accurate so far. As John Gruber pointed out on <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/3/">last week’s <em>Talk Show</em></a>, the entire tech press was blindsided by the company’s introduction of their next OS, 10.8 Mountain Lion. No one saw it coming, and it seems Apple’s road-map is proving to be more elusive than ever.</p>

<p>The biggest rumors people are thinking will appear at WWDC are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iOS 6
    <ul>
      <li>With brand new maps!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More Mountain Lion Details</li>
  <li>New Mac Pros</li>
  <li>Revamped AppleTV Interface</li>
  <li>Apple-branded Television</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it’s a given that we’re going to see a lot of iOS 6 and Mountain Lion at WWDC. It <em>is</em> a developer’s convention after all, and the best way to keep them satisfied is by letting them peek up Apple’s skirt once a year.</p>

<p>New Mac Pros <em>might</em> be a centerpiece of WWDC, but it’s rarely a hardware-centric keynote. The only way we’re going to hear anything about a new Mac Pro from the Moscone stage is if the form factor, which hasn’t seen an overhaul <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g5/specs/powermac_g5_1.6.html">since 2003</a>, is something radically different. If it’s a spec-boost (new processors, perhaps redesigned interiors) then Cook will either make a quick mention of the Mac Pro line or ignore it completely. Then one night the store will go down and when it comes back up there will be new systems to snag.</p>

<p>Now, about all the AppleTV rumors…</p>

<p>I don’t see Apple announcing any kind of updated hardware in this line at WWDC. The newest AppleTV set-top-box was introduced in March of this year. It’s doubtful that they will have a new version of the current AppleTV a mere three months after its introduction.</p>

<p>Now, it’s possible, I suppose, that Apple will introduce a new segment in their set-top-box line, something along the lines of an AppleTV Pro, offering a more expensive, more refined experience. But when I look at what the current AppleTV does for its $99 price-tag, I can’t think of anything it <em>should</em> do that would be worth spending more money on. Consumers have said loud and clear, notably to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/10/2553406/logitech-ceo-google-tv-cost-us-dearly-no-revue-replacement-coming">Logitech with their miserable GoogleTV Revue</a>, that they do not want to spent more than $100 on a streaming set-top-box.</p>

<p>If AppleTV is mentioned at WWDC this year, the announcement will most certainly be software-related. The area where the AppleTV <em>is</em> lacking is in third-party support, which is to say there is none. While Apple has major content partnerships with Netflix, MLB.TV and the NBA among others, not just anyone can come along and stream video through the box. For that, Apple would have to open the platform up and allow developers to build apps. And you can bet that is something that will happen eventually, if not next week.</p>

<p>WWDC seems like the perfect opportunity to bring the company’s wildly successful App Store to the AppleTV. If it does happen, and there’s a major update to the AppleTV’s interface, I believe it will be software only, much like an update to Mac OS X. Current users will be able to update their AppleTVs from home, while new customers will have fresh installs of the new software.</p>

<p>There is the matter of storage, of course. The current AppleTV has 8GB of flash memory inside of it, though Apple doesn’t advertise it. That seems like ample space to hold enough apps to keep the average viewer happy, since all of the AppleTV’s content is streamed and/or cached temporarily. Perhaps future iterations of the device will sport more storage to handle the glut of apps that come to the platform.</p>

<p>I would love to see Apple integrate iOS games more tightly with the AppleTV. Since there is still a storage limitation on the current AppleTV, I doubt we’ll be seeing it turn into a full-fledged gaming console anytime soon. However, any update that includes third-party apps will have to take gaming into account given its success on the iPad and iPhone. Perhaps better AirPlay integration with games will save on storage but still allow developers to offer a unique gaming experience on the AppleTV.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s this whole rumor of an Apple television set. I don’t think this is a product that will be coming out any time soon, and honestly I still don’t see why Apple would enter such a competitive business. Maybe when they actually do introduce a television set I’ll smack myself on the forehead and say, “Oooooooh, that makes perfect sense,” but for now I don’t see the advantages either for Apple or for me, as a user.</p>

<p>Apple’s product lines are notoriously focused. When I think of them building a television, I have to assume they’ll only build one or two sizes, at least to start. But what sizes? 27 inches? 42? 50? Where’s the sweet spot for Apple? The reason other manufacturers offer so many television sizes is that consumers demand it. Depending on the room size and the couch distance and any number of other factors, consumers want very specific television dimensions to their specific needs. If Apple comes in and offers one television with premium AppleTV integration, I don’t know that will be an attractive enough proposition for most people.</p>

<p>My gut tells me that this year’s WWDC will be entirely software focused. AppleTV may be a topic of conversation, but I won’t be surprised if WWDC comes and goes with no mention of the platform whatsoever. Either way, I’m sure we’re going to see some nice improvements next week.</p>

<p>And hopefully I’m wrong; hopefully there will be some big, exciting surprises.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://vimeo.com/40483583">Schiebel Camcopter S-100</a> and the <a href="http://www.smallhd.com/dp7/index.html">SmallHDCamera-Top Monitor</a> currently don&rsquo;t have price tags, but everything else in <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/essentials-movie-maker/">Uncrate&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essentials: Movie Maker&rdquo;</a> can be yours for a cool $31,964. A bargain compared to four year at a top-tier film school. Of course, you should know how to turn this stuff on and have a story to tell, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped anyone before.</p>

<p>I wish Uncrate would make a poster of this image.</p>
