  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/02/fcp-mountain-lion.jpg" title="FCP in Mountain Lion" /></p>

<p>Yesterday, Apple gave the world a sneak peek at Mountain Lion, the new version of OS X due out this summer. Much like Snow Leopard was to Leopard, the changes in Mountain Lion, at least those revealed thus far, are more iterative that revolutionary. Almost every feature highlighted by Apple brings technology from iOS back to the Mac, hooking into the company’s cloud storage solution, iCloud. Here’s what <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/mountain_lion">John Gruber has to say</a> about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I remain convinced that iCloud is exactly what Steve Jobs said it was: the cornerstone of everything Apple does for the next decade. So of course it makes sense to bring iCloud to the Mac in a big way. Simplified document storage, iMessage, Notification Center, synced Notes and Reminders — all of these things are part of iCloud. It’s all a step toward making your Mac just another device managed in your iCloud account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with Gruber, iCloud <em>is</em> Apple’s central product for the coming decade. With Mountain Lion, they are trying to make the computing experience, be it on a Mac, an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, feel as seamless as possible. Document syncing, if executed properly, is the bridge between all of their products. Even, I hope, Final Cut Pro.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Figuring out what to see at a film festival as jam-packed as SXSW<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is a dark art I am yet to master. This year’s programmers have slated 132 feature films. If each one is 90 minutes (a fair average) it would take over eight days to watch them all around the clock. I’m only there for six…and I sleep. At any fest, you’re going to miss a large chunk of the films on offer. This year, I’m using <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> to help prioritize which films I’ll add to my schedule.</p>

<p><em>[If you’d like to just dive in, you can skip ahead to the <a href="#downloads">downloads</a> section and grab the files I’m describing in this article.]</em></p>

<p>I’ve written before about how Scrivener is <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/20/my-text-problem/">no longer my go-to writing app</a>, but it still holds an important place in my workflow. Originally created to help tame the disparate strands of a novel writer’s mind, the app has grown into a veritable Swiss Army knife of textual tools. I use it all the time to convert Word .docx documents to Markdown formatting, and it is the best transcription app available on the Mac. When I have a really out of control piece of writing Scrivener can break my nonsense up into sections so I can see a sort of exploded view of my thoughts. That’s what it feels like when scheduling festival coverage; the abundance of great work can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>The good news is that SXSW’s Web site is one of the most comprehensive as far as film festivals go. It makes it extremely easy to organize screenings by day, venue, title and screening series. However, in order for my mind to wrap itself around the festival calendar, I need to first familiarize myself with the films. And for that, the Web site leaves a bit to be desired, at least in the first phase of “which films do I want to learn more about?”</p>

<p>I used the handy press releases that the fest sent out and rolled my own little system. First I copied and pasted the films and series into <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> and cleaned them up a bit so that each film’s description was a “note.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Then I exported that as an OPML file, which I imported (using “Import and Split”) into Scrivener.</p>

<p>Why go to all the trouble? I’ll show you:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/02/scrivener-sxsw-1.jpg" alt="Scrivener SXSW 1" /></p>

<p>If you’ve never seen a Scrivener project before, I can bring you up to speed. On the left side of the window is the Binder which is basically where your documents live. Think of the film series (HEADLINERS, NARRATIVE SPOTLIGHT, etc.) in the Binder as folders and the films themselves (<em>21 Jump Street</em>, <em>BIG EASY EXPRESS</em>, etc.) as documents.</p>

<p>In the main section of the window you’ll see note cards on a cork board. Those are all of the films in the selected series. Since I set the films’ descriptions as notes in OmniOutliner before creating the OPML file, Scrivener automatically fills in the “synopsis” on each card. Now we have that exploded view of the films that I was looking for. All of the films and their short descriptions are organized on cards that I can sort and annotate. But we’re just getting started.</p>

<p>Scrivener has a very powerful (and fast) search function. Even better, you can save any search as a “Collection”; any document that matches your search criteria will be added to a tab in the Collections area above the Binder. Since SXSW’s press materials note whether or not the film is a World, North American or US premiere, I built collections to search for exactly those words. You can build your own collections to be as specific as you like. The notes for the films also include country of origin, so you could create a search collection for “Ireland,” for example, and see what films pop up. You could even type in keywords like “comedy” or “horror.” You can really hone in on anything you like, as long as that information is in the film’s title or description.</p>

<p>Finally, you actually have to make some decisions about which films you are going to see. Scrivener has tools that can help there too. Let’s turn on the Inspector panel.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/02/scrivener-sxsw-2.jpg" alt="Scrivener SXSW 2" /></p>

<p>In the Inspector on the right, a slew of document options pop up. Remember, each film is actually a document. I’ve made custom labels for to determine my interest level in a film. When I add a label to a film, the right-hand corner of the card will change color. Now I can start to piece together how many films in each series I’d like to see. Additionally, I can add notes on each film. Those notes and labels are also searchable, so I can further create collections of the films I’m interested in. Now, finally, I can go to the calendar listings on the SXSW Web site and begin to piece together my schedule with a more informed outlook.</p>

<p>The idea here isn’t to set aside the films I have no interest in seeing. Part of what makes a festival experience enjoyable (and desirable) is the sense of chance that comes along with dropping yourself into an unfamiliar town. I have been happily surprised by many films that were nowhere on my radar before a festival. In fact I’ve accidentally walked into some of my favorite films. Still, landing in Austin without a plan has been my modus operandi for two years running. This year, I’d like to at least try to plan out what I want to see beforehand. Scrivener makes that a lot easier to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Redditor <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/capt_wink_martindale/submitted/">capt_wink_martindale</a> was a film student in 2001 when he started work on an adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s 1941 short story, “Reason,” which was later compiled into the 1950 collection, “I, Robot.” After receiving permission to adapt the story from Asimov’s estate, he moved forward on the project. Of course, Twentieth Century Fox also had plans for (roughly) the same material and, somehow, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/pq8ra/this_is_why_i_oppose_the_mpaa">caught wind of the student film</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of the letter recognizing our valiant efforts as students that I expected, I found myself on the tail end of a phone call that changed my life. I was contacted directly by the lead of the studio’s legal team, who explained my situation to me very clearly. He told me that I was technically in my legal right to use Isaac Asimov’s material. However, if I chose to proceed, they would file multiple lawsuits totaling over 2 million dollars against me. In the end, I might win, but it would take hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to fight it, but would cost them nothing more than the salaries they already pay their lawyers. It would be 10 years before any type of verdict could be levied, and by then it wouldn’t matter what the outcome was, since their film would be long since released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Movie studios seem to throw their legal weight around for sport. It’s impossible that this little film could have been a threat to Fox’s multi-million dollar sci-fi endeavor. They had Will Smith, the biggest star in the world, in the lead role. If some kid’s school project really <em>was</em> a threat, than they have bigger problems than friendly competition.</p>

<p>Stories like this one, which are a dime a dozen, prove that we need to rethink Intellectual Property law in this country, not bolster it with more severe legislation. It makes perfect sense that the richest companies would be able to make more polished films and squash the competition at the theaters; game on. But how is it fair that the fattest checkbook can suppress artistic expression? This is legalized extortion. Congress should take note.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/02/final-draft-reader.jpg" title="Final Draft Reader Screenshots" /></p>

<p>Yesterday, Final Draft, Inc. <a href="http://www.finaldraft.com/company/newsletter-archive/newsletter-20120209_finalDraftIpadApp.html">announced</a> their long gestating iPad app: Final Draft Reader. The company has been talking about this since <a href="http://www.finaldraft.com/company/newsletter-archive/newsletter-20100222.html">before the first iPads</a> made it into the hands of users. Now, after over 2 years of talk, the app is almost here (February 16th is the expected launch date).</p>

<p>It’s no secret that I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/poritsky/status/167735379183677440">not too fond of Final Draft</a>. By design, it’s the Microsoft Word of screenwriting apps, the behemoth that everyone <em>has</em> to know but <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/08/17/back-to-work-29/">no one really enjoys using</a>. Still, their tools work extremely well for the tasks that all scripts require through production. When announcing <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a> earlier this week, <a href="http://johnaugust.com/2012/introducing-fountain">John August put it best</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To me, calls for a “Final Draft killer” are hugely misguided. Professional screenwriters will always need apps that can do the heavy lifting when it comes to production: revisions, locked pages, colored pages, etc. The big apps do this well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m very excited to introduce you to the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/12/08/screenplay-markdown-for-marked-is-here/">Screenplay Markdown for Marked’s</a> successor: Fountain for Marked. <a href="http://fountain.io/">Fountain</a> is the new name for Screenplay Markdown syntax. It combines Stu Maschwitz’s <a href="http://prolost.com/spmd">original ideas for SPMD</a> with a similar <a href="http://johnaugust.com/2012/introducing-fountain">ongoing project from filmmaker John August</a>. Both specs have now been unified into one open source project. As <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2012/2/8/spmd-is-now-fountain.html">Stu put it earlier today</a>, “Fountain is everything SPMD was, now with the support of a respected industry pro with a track record of creating best-in-class apps for screenwriters.”</p>

<p>Bookmark the new home of the plain text screenwriting, <a href="http://fountain.io">fountain.io</a>, for updates on new apps and changes to the syntax. Most of the latest version of Fountain is supported in Fountain for Marked with notable exceptions listed below. If you don’t have it already, go pick up a copy of Brett Terpstra’s <a href="http://markedapp.com">Marked</a> before following the installation instructions below.</p>

<p>I have been involved with this project for a few months now. It has been an amazing experience watching Screenplay Markdown grow from an idea to an actual thing to a full-fledged project. This is still the very beginning of something big. Something John mentioned in his <a href="http://johnaugust.com/2012/introducing-fountain">introduction of Fountain</a> will really stick with me as I continue to contribute to the Fountain community:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back when we announced FDX Reader, I got a lot of emails asking, “When are you going to make a screenwriting app?”</p>

  <p>Answer: Today. My hope is that we just made a thousand. Fountain turns every text editor into a screenwriting app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All right, that’s enough chatter (for now). I’ll be writing a bit more about Fountain here soon, but why not just take it for a spin? Feel free to ask any questions in the comments or by <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/contact">contacting me</a> directly. Happy writing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This YouTube embed of George Méliès’s <em>Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon)</em> will probably get taken down in the near future, so you should watch it while you can.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6Nx8hVGzSO4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is the newly restored color version of the 1902 film featuring a brand new soundtrack from Air that premiered at Cannes last year. Even though this version of the film has digital hits, I found it more exhilarating than a lot of the action films I’ve seen in the past year. The color restoration is gorgeous; it brings out a layer of the film that we’ve been missing for over a century.</p>

<p><em>Le voyage dans la lune</em> may be 110 years old but it’s having quite the comeback. In the past year it got a restoration of a presumed lost color print, a brand new pop soundtrack that fits the material quite nicely and an extended love letter to the film and its maker in the form of Martin Scorsese’s Best Picture nominated (and wonderful) <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/29/review-hugo/"><em>Hugo</em></a>.</p>

<p>Air released their album, which comes with the above video, today. Unfortunately, the only ways to get the video legitimately right now are in standard definition, but there is <a href="http://youtu.be/b64Jwg_kls8?hd=1">definitely a 1080p cut</a> of this floating around. You should probably just buy the album so you can see a (slightly) better quality version of the film.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Like most people, I was oblivious to blinking until <em>The Conversation</em>, which was the first feature that I edited. I had the repeated, uncanny experience of watching Gene Hackman’s close-ups and deciding where to cut—<em>He put the tape down, and now he’s thinking about what he’s going to do with the tape and … cut</em>. Very frequently, more frequently than I would have thought, the point that I decided to cut was the point that Hackman blinked.

<p>Some of this may be familiar territory if you’ve read Murch’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1879505622/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecandlerblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1879505622"><em>In the Blink of an Eye</em></a>, but there is also new material from an interview in the forthcoming <em>The 8 Train</em> by Joshua Melnick.</p>

<p>Murch is not only a master filmmaker but also one of cinema’s great professors. He is able to boil down the most complex aspects of light, time, space and the human brain into simple, articulate terms for our benefit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today would have been filmmaker François Truffaut’s 80th birthday had he not passed away in 1984. To honor his birthday, Google posted a very special doodle in place of their logo today for users in (at least) the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk">UK</a> and <a href="http://www.google.fr">France</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It’s a shame inquisitive Americans weren’t treated to a brief introduction to the French master, but the doodles are easy enough to get to. Here they are:</p>

<p>Over on Vimeo, user Wyatt Hodgson has uploaded his first video entitled <a href="http://vimeo.com/36205162">“Balance Out of Life”</a> (embedded above). It is the entirety of Godfrey Reggio’s landmark 1982 film, <em>Koyaanisqatsi: Life out of Balance</em>, sped up exponentially bringing the runtime to just over 5 minutes. From Hodgson’s notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Video: Koyaanisqatsi at 1552% speed. (The year 1552 marks the publication of &#8220;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies,&#8221; an account of the mistreatment of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas)</p><p>Audio: &#8220;The Holy Egoism of Genius,&#8221; a track off the 1999 album The Seduction of Claude Debussy by The Art of Noise.</p></blockquote>

<p>While this decontextualizes Reggio’s film (and does away completely with Philip Glass’s score) it isn’t any less mystifying than the original. <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> has proven to have remarkable staying power for a film which is best experienced in a theater with live musical accompianiment.</p>

<p>Hodgson has reframed that experience. What does it mean that we can watch it online, windowed in a web browser, in as much time as it takes to take out the trash? I’m not sure, but questions like those are why I really enjoy this little experiment.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED 02/06/2012:</strong> Over in the comments on Vimeo, user <a href="https://vimeo.com/stretta">stretta</a> points to a sped up version of Philip Glass’s <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> score he posted that matches the above video. I think speeding up the whole film, audio and video, provides a completely different experiment than what Hodgson was trying to do with his piece. Still, this seems a noteworthy addition so I’m embedding it below. You can mute the video and play the audio, but be warned, it’s not easy to make it through all 5 minutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Didn&#8217;t see this one coming and we will try to get as many details up as soon as we can. Yes Avid have made their editing software available for the iPad at $4.99 and professional FCP editors around the world are suffering from mass schadenfreude. The price will jump to $7.99 after 30 days.</p><footer><strong>fcp.co</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.fcp.co/hardware-and-software/consumer/720-avid-launch-avid-studio-for-the-ipad-iavid-anybody">Avid Launch Avid Studio for the iPad - iAvid Anybody?</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>While I haven&rsquo;t test-driven the app (yet), it appears to be a knock-off of Apple&rsquo;s iMovie for iOS. That isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. The screenshots and product descriptions make it seem like Avid is improving upon Apple&rsquo;s lead, bringing more &ldquo;precision&rdquo; (their word, not mine) tools to the iPad.</p>

<p>Projects created within Avid Studio for iPad can be exported and shared with Avid Studio for the PC (yep, Windows only). I had never heard of Avid Studio until this morning (is it brand new?) so I can&rsquo;t comment on it. After giving its <a href="http://www.avid.com/us/products/avid-studio">product description</a> a once-over though, it appears to directly compete with FCP X.</p>

<p>There was a lot of noise in the editing community when Apple killed Final Cut Pro 7. It was assumed that the &ldquo;pros&rdquo; would opt for Avid&rsquo;s high-end tools and the cheapskates would go for Apple&rsquo;s playthings.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Looks like Avid wants the low-end market as well. The more these two companies compete, the more innovative products we&rsquo;re going to see in this space.</p>
