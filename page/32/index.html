  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m perpetually changing the way I use OmniFocus. The only thing I’ve used it consistently for since purchasing it in 2009 is as a grocery list. Otherwise, my workflow is up in the air. When I get into a groove (as I am now) though, it is the best tool to make me get off my tushy and get things done. As it turns out, I also happen to enjoy fiddling with how I use it.</p>

<h3 id="allow-me-to-introduce-plaintasksof">Allow Me to Introduce PlainTasksOF</h3>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks">PlainTasks</a>, Allen Bargi’s todo plugin for Sublime Text 2 that got some attention this week from the Mac bloggerati. Similar in function to Hog Bay Software’s <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a>, PlainTasks allows users to navigate a plain text document as if it were a task list, making it simple to nest tasks in projects, move tasks up and down, mark them as completed and add tags to them. As in the case of TaskPaper, users get all the benefits of plain text, namely searchability, speed and platform agnosticity.</p>

<p>Bargi describes the plugin as “opinionated,” which is an understatement. With its legal pad yellow-styling, it feels far outside my box, but there was still something appealing about the idea of a plain text task list to add to my OmniFocus workflow, so I forked the package and got to work.</p>

<p>I made a new theme, tweaked the <code>.sublime-settings</code>, added new scopes to the Tasks syntax grammar and changed the way the package handles tags so that tasks can have more than one highlighted. I call it <a href="https://github.com/poritsky/PlainTasksOF">PlainTasksOF</a>, and you can go <a href="https://github.com/poritsky/PlainTasksOF">grab it over on GitHub</a>. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/6ebc54b33566217d772e55c0b76397b947c14766/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f3039336832573156343530553138336b3352324c2f53637265656e25323053686f74253230323031322d30392d31382532306174253230332e32392e3237253230504d2e504e47" title="PlainTasksOF Sample" /></p>

<p>I don’t want to detail its installation here, though I’ll gladly field any questions you may have if you want to <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/contact/">shoot me an email</a>. Suffice it to say it looks and sorta-kinda works like OmniFocus.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Why? I don’t view this kind of plain text solution as a replacement for OmniFocus. It isn’t as powerful, simple or pretty. However, I’ve always had an idea on how to use these kinds of external lists, but I wanted a solution that looks similar for comfort’s sake. PlainTasksOF is a start.</p>

<h3 id="storing-repetitive-tasks">Storing Repetitive Tasks</h3>

<p>There are many sorts of tasks I don’t like keeping in OmniFocus. Some I’ll put on my calendar while others end up in <a href="http://www.dueapp.com">Due</a>. Filling up OmniFocus with granular tasks can get overwhelming fast, especially if they’re the sorts of things you have to do daily. The idea here is to use OmniFocus as a means of nudging me to do a longer list of repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>Clean the bathroom, for example, is a project made up of many granular tasks like scrub the shower, mop the floor, clean the inside of the toilet bowl, and so on. I don’t always need to do them all and I’d prefer not to set it up as a recurring series of tasks in OmniFocus. Instead, I could have one task for “Clean the bathroom” and link it to a PlainTasks list.</p>

<p>Let me share (what I think is) a better example. I’ve always liked the sentiment behind <a href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=10626">Curt Clifton’s “Review” task lists</a>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but I’ve never really tried adding them to my workflow. In short, Curt shared repetitive lists for reviewing his GTD workflow twice a day, once a week and once a month. It sounds like overkill, but the idea is to give you a basic guide to see what’s on your plate and what you’re neglecting. Here’s my modified version of Curt’s list:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
<span class="line-number">9</span>
<span class="line-number">10</span>
<span class="line-number">11</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">* Process Email
</span><span class="line">* Review Today's Calendar
</span><span class="line">* Empty OmniFocus Inbox
</span><span class="line">* Review active projects
</span><span class="line">    Step through Active Projects due for review today
</span><span class="line">    * Any projects to put On Hold or move to someday/maybe? (Be draconian)
</span><span class="line">    * Any projects that are stuck?
</span><span class="line">        * Planning/clarity needed?
</span><span class="line">        * True next action identified?
</span><span class="line">        * Attach purpose, "success looks like", etc.
</span><span class="line">* Review Next Actions Lists</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It’s basic stuff most of us do anyway, but by writing it out it makes it a bit easier to stay on track. I don’t want to see all of this in OmniFocus, but I <em>do</em> want a task to remind me to check what I have in store in the morning. Keeping it handy as a guide would do the trick. Here’s what the above list looks like PlainTasksOF:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2Q1X2B2Y443z170T2z0A/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-19%20at%201.17.36%20PM.PNG" title="Daily Review PlainTasksOF" /></p>

<p>I can tick off items as I complete them by hitting ⌘+d on the current task. When I’m done I can either close without saving (preserving the formatting for tomorrow) or restore an older version of the same list. I can link the file by dragging and dropping it into the note field of a repeating OmniFocus task where it can be double clicked and launched in Sublime Text 2.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>This can be used for all sorts of lists, not just repetitive tasks. I’m working on a list (and task) for films I’d like to watch and books I’d like to read. These PlainTask lists serve as a sort of cold storage for lists I don’t want to bring into OmniFocus, at least that’s the idea.</p>

<p>There are a few more tweaks that make this workflow a bit more viable<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> but I’ll end this here. I’d love to hear feedback on this sort of system and hear how others use external list apps in conjunction with OmniFocus (or Things or whatever).</p>

<div class="footnotes">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vimeo just launched a new series of enhancements they’re calling <a href="https://vimeo.com/creatorservices">Creator Services</a>, starting with “<a href="https://vimeo.com/help/faq/tip_jar">Tip Jar</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vimeo Tip Jar allows your fans to show their appreciation for your videos with small cash payments to you. By giving a tip, you’re not only telling a creator how important their work is to you, you’re also giving them the resources to make more of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Early next year they’re introducing a pay-to-view option. Ever since <a href="http://buy.louisck.net/news/a-statement-from-louis-c-k">Louis C.K.’s “Live at the Beacon Theater” experiment</a>, filmmakers have been invigorated by the potential of self-distribution. The biggest hurdle, it seems, is conceiving of a hosting and payment pipeline for videos. Vimeo appears to have removed that obstacle. 2013 is looking like a big year for digital distribution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Me, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/09/19/qwikster-cometh/">a year ago today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an honest and transparent message to customers today, CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings expressed regret over his handling of the company’s recent restructuring and announced that the disc-by-mail service will soon be spun off into a separate product known as Qwikster. Netflix proper will be a streaming only company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/10/qwikster-goeth/">j/k</a>!</p>

<p>What a year it has been for Netflix. All the chatter nowadays revolves around the company’s original programming and their exhumation of <em>Arrested Development</em>. We all seem to forget that they were in a tailspin only twelve months ago after a series of poor decisions.</p>

<p>In the end, common sense won over. The company never got Qwikster off the ground,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> they implemented the price hike as they always said they would and Hastings remains at the company’s helm relatively unscathed. His colleagues, however, were <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/07/12/netflixs-off-year/">picked off one by one</a>.</p>

<p>Consumers have a short memory. Netflix’s streaming service is far more compelling than what the competition has to offer, and their disc-by-mail service is still a cash-cow. There is a lesson here somewhere, but I’ll be damned if I can figure it out. Hastings’s <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html">self-described</a> “arrogance” gutted his company’s board, initiated the exodus of nearly a million customers and tarnished one of the best names in customer service. And then, piece by piece he put the company back on track.</p>

<p>So, go with your gut? Break some eggs to make an omelet? Be Reed Hastings?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Neither did the promised games-by-mail service that was to be the silver-lining of Qwikster’s numerous inconveniences.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/09/the-romney-video-docu-drama.html">Richard Brody</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser">instantly historic video</a> of Mitt Romney’s address to backers in Florida is important for its content, of course, but a significant dose of its affect arises from its visual style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many reasons to read Brody’s <em>New Yorker</em> blog, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies">The Front Row</a> and posts like this are chief among them. I, like most people, see these videos and think of the breaking news implications. He sees cinema:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s the difference between theatre and cinema: politics used to be a stage, in which candidates performed with a rhetorical fervor and their conspicuous artifice was a source of ridicule. Now, it’s an open-ended movie, in which the camera threatens constantly to reveal actual character, and this drives candidates to an even more impeccable and impressive yet alienating technical perfection (as it does to many movie actors).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Distributor and wearer of many other cinematic hats Ira Deutchman learned some <a href="http://iradeutchman.com/indiefilm/more-bad-news-about-vpfs-or-is-it/">new info on how the Virtual Print Fee</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Print_Fee">VPF</a>)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is effecting indie distribution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It means that theaters are incentivized not to holdover films for very long. This is potentially the death knell for the types of films that require word-of-mouth to build into a hit. Now, we all know that the old fashioned word-of-mouth film has been on life support for a while now. A film like “Hoop Dreams,” which required 6 solid months of business before it started to take off could never happen today. But now will we be seeing films that could have played 5 or 6 weeks reduced to 1 or 2 in order to support the number of “turns” required by the VPF deals?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only place to go next is to nix theatrical distribution of lower performing work altogether. I’ll bet there are a few studio heads who can’t wait to get these kinds of films out of their hair.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>In short, the VPF is an incentive to theater owners to facilitate the purchase of digital projection equipment.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Karina Longworth <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-09-12/news/kims-%20video-Sicily/all/">gets investigative for The Village Voice</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The closing of a video store is not news. With Web streaming, the vanishing DVD sales market, and Netflix, it’s an inevitability. Usually, the fate of the physical videos after the store’s closing isn’t news, either. Maybe there’s a dollar sale. Maybe employees smuggle home the dead stock. The customers adapt. They find another video store. They use BitTorrent and YouPorn.</p>

  <p>This is how it happens. If you’ve ever had a video-store membership, this has probably happened to you.</p>

  <p>This is not how it happened with Mondo Kim’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spending hours wandering Kim’s was one of my favorite things to do in NYC even before I lived there. I was sad to see it go, but I thought it was just the way of things. There’s more to it, though. Longworth travels to Salemi, Italy to find out what happened to one of the greatest video collections on the planet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I’m playing with <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a> again, it brought up a question I tried to avoid back when I was working on <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/02/08/fountain-for-marked/">Fountain for Marked</a>: which version of Courier is the correct one? Before I get into this I should tell you that the correct answer is “whichever one you like.” I’ve <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/08/16/i-hope-screenplay-markdown-kills-the-page-paradigm/">written before</a> that the aging rules of screenplay formatting are a hindrance in our digital age, but hey, if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In tweaking <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/10/fountain-for-sublime-text/">Fountain for Sublime Text</a>, I had the opportunity to set the default font when opening a <code>.fountain</code> document. Users can override this, and in fact part of the fun of Fountain, in my opinion, is in not being locked to a single font as you are when you use that expensive app that rhymes with “Primal Shaft.” However, since the Courier font is so tied to screenwriting, I thought it would be a good reminder that you’re working on a Fountain document.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>If there were only one version of Courier (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)">Wikipedia</a>) it would be simple. But there aren’t. Here are the four I keep on my system are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Courier (System)</li>
  <li>Courier New (System)</li>
  <li><a href="http://support.finaldraft.com/article.aspx?cid=1001&amp;aid=5328">Courier Final Draft</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fadeinpro.com/page.pl?content=download#fonts">Courier Screenplay</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For a great read on Courier, I recommend Roland Stroud’s <a href="http://www.rolandstroud.com/downloads/essays/courierfonts.pdf">“Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Courier &#8230; And Then Some” (PDF)</a>. He goes deep into how the font works, including this interesting tid-bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real criterion is not the name of the font, but its look. Is it a bearded, monospaced font that you can print at 12 points? Does it have the same general look as Courier fonts? Does it look crisp and neat? If the answer is yes to these questions, then you can use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the purposes of editing a screenplay in Sublime Text, most of this doesn’t matter as you should <em>never</em> print directly from the app. We have <a href="http://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland/">Highland</a> and <a href="http://olivertaylor.net/textplay/">Textplay</a> and <a href="http://www.screenplain.com">Screenplain</a> for the that. That said, I still kinda like aping the printed page look in my editor. So let’s look at some versions of Courier.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/courier.png" title="Courier Specimen" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/courier-new.png" title="Courier New Specimen" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/courier-fd.png" title="Courier Final Draft Specimen" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/courier-screenplay.png" title="Courier Screenplay Specimen" /></p>

<p>(<strong>Note on methods</strong>: the above character palettes and below closeups are screen grabs from <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/fontcase/">Fontcase</a>. As such the resulting <code>.png</code> files were generated at 72dpi. As such they likely won’t render crisp on retina displays. The last image below of body samples, however, was generated at 300dpi. These images are meant merely to be illustrative.)</p>

<p>The main recognizable difference is that “Courier New” is significantly thinner than the rest. I laid the fonts over one another the find other glaring differences, but the truth is that, save for a few items like “Courier Final Draft’s” more modern ampersand or “Courier’s” titled octothorpe, they are all quite similar.</p>

<p>In order to get a closer look, I blew up the lowercase <code>m</code> glyph for each font and placed them next to one another:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/m-glyphs.png" title="Courier m Glyphs" /></p>

<p>The thinness of “Courier New” becomes more pronounced when you look at it up close. “Courier Final Draft” appears to be a slightly shaved down (or molded, really) version of “Courier” while “Courier Screenplay” is more squat. Of course, that’s only looking at a single glyph.</p>

<p>Here is a classic excerpt from Lawrence Kasdan’s script for <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> set in all four fonts at 12 point. The width, accordingly, is set around 432 point (I think I added a point or two), or the equivalent of six inches on a printed page, the amount allotted to action blocks in screenplay formatting.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/courier-bodies.png" title="Courier Body Samples" /></p>

<p>As you can see, Roland Stroud’s rule of thumb holds true. Each paragraph looks identical on a macro level. The ragged right edge matches the copy of the printed <em>Raiders</em> script I have exactly, so if we’re looking for simulacrum, any of these fonts will suffice.</p>

<p>“Courier New” looks almost unreadable on my screen. While it may look crisp on a printed page, it’s too thin to use in a text editor. To my eye, “Courier” and “Courier Screenplay” look much stronger at 12 point than “Courier Final Draft.” However, the fonts render with slightly different heights. It’s not so apparent here on an image, but if you switch back and forth between the fonts in Sublime Text (or any editor) you’ll start to see the difference.</p>

<p>For me, Courier Screenplay looks the best when editing within Sublime Text, so it’s what I’m going to use when working on scripts (until I change my mind).</p>

<p>As for the defaults in the Sublime Text package, I changed the default font to “Courier” since it’s a system font that all users will be able to load without conflict. Additionally, “Courier” has the most extensive set of glyphs of any of the fonts in question, so non-English writers will want to stick with it.</p>

<p>I’m removing “Courier New” as a pre-set option in Fountain for Sublime Text. Users can easily add it back in, but I think it’s just taking up space in the <code>.sublime-settings</code> file.</p>

<p>“Courier Screenplay” will be the second choice font for users to rely on and the “Courier Final Draft” will remain below it. I wish that Sublime Text supported fallback fonts the way CSS does, but since it doesn’t users will have to manually change the font of choice in the app. Shouldn’t be too hard for screenwriting nerds, though.</p>

<p>One more nerdy change. In the aforementioned Courier piece, Roland Stroud shares this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The distinguishing feature of a typewriter font was not its typeface, but its pitch, which is the number of characters it makes per inch. […] Two pitches were available: standard 12-point pica, which measured out to 10 characters per inch; and 10-point elite, which measured out to 12 characters per inch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 12-point is the screenplay standard, I’ll take Stroud’s measurement of ten characters per inch and multiply it by our six-inches of action slug on a traditional screenplay page: sixty characters per line. The Fountain package specifies the width of the text column in characters (and moves it to the center).</p>

<p>The text column width is now set by default to sixty-one characters (sixty didn’t look right) which lines up nicely with a printed screenplay. The <em>Raiders</em> excerpt, for example, looks identical in Sublime Text as it does on a printed page. Since this width is in characters, you are free to change the font size, or font for that matter, and the column should grow accordingly.</p>

<p>Okay, I think that’s enough on Courier for one day. Back to writing, maybe.</p>

      <p>The rules of screenplay formatting work because of the 1 page=1 minute rule but, come on, we’ve got supercomputers and such; can’t we come up with a way to count approximate screen time without relying on words stuffed in a 8.5x11” rectangle?<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Apple’s original iPhone native YouTube app was revolutionary. Remember: YouTube switched to H.264 video to accommodate streaming video to the Flash-less iPhone. But it’s well past its prime and YouTube’s mobile site has some limitations. Glad to see Google is keeping its iOS offerings fresh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday folks <a href="http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/9/9/dont-be-angry-9to5mac-is-doing-you-a-favor.html">started noticing</a> that <a href="http://9to5mac.com">9to5Mac</a>, an Apple news clearinghouse with a reputation for dubious posts, couldn’t be saved to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> with the service’s Bookmarklet. Today, Matt Buchanan at BuzzFeed got <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbuchanan/how-to-get-banned-from-instapaper">the full story</a> from Marco Arment, the maker of Instapaper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though the original error message implied <em>9to5Mac</em> had requested the block, Arment later confirmed on Twitter he proactively blocked <em>9to5Mac</em> because he believes it “objects” to Instapaper, and that what it’s published about Instapaper is potentially libelous…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post was originally a critical reaction to Marco’s stance, that those who libel his company shouldn’t get to be on it. I knew that Marco would eventually blog about this himself and shed some light on the situation, but no explanation short of reversing the block and apoligizing seemed acceptable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/31303984531">It seems Marco agreed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve now reversed that decision, and I’m sorry that I overreacted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No company, not even a small one, not even one with a (sometimes) likable personality at its helm, should get to tell us what we can read on the Internet. The idea that any part of the open Web could be blacked out at the whim of one person <em>should</em> be ominous.</p>

<p>Imagine if Google had removed <em>The New York Times</em> from search results due to coverage it didn’t agree with.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’m sure the Marco would not stand for that, so I’m glad he saw his error and corrected it.</p>

<p>However, these mistakes will happen. It’s how companies deal with them that matters, and Marco righted this one quickly. I doubt it will happen again.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I know this is a terrible analogy. 9to5Mac is no New York Times and the coverage in question turned out to be bogus and harmful. But data is data.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
