  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s a new year. You deserve a laugh, don’t you?</p>

<p>Last year I installed the “Cloud-to-Butt” <a href="https://github.com/logancollins/cloud-to-butt-safari" title="Safari-to-Butt">Safari extension</a>, based on the original <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt" title="Chrome-to-Butt">Chrome extension</a> by <a href="http://stevenf.com">Steven Frank</a> (of <a href="http://www.panic.com">Panic</a> fame). It’s pretty good for a chuckle. Here’s how Steven describes it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of ‘the cloud’ with ‘my butt’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surf the web, see “my butt” and laugh. That’s it.</p>

<p>There are extensions for <a href="https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-opera" title="Opera-to-Butt">Opera</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla" title="Firefox-to-Butt">Firefox</a> as well. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/cloud-to-butt/" title="Cloud-to-Butt Gallery">Flickr gallery</a>, too.</p>

<p>I think my personal favorite<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> grab is this one of a Frank Chimero <a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/03/the-cloud-is-heavy-and-design-isnt-invisible/">blog post</a> last year:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/01/chimero.png" title="“My butt is heavy…”" /></p>

<p>Happy New Year. And you’re welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Heading into to December I felt like I had barely seen any films this year. This was technically true. I used to do sixty to seventy new release films a year and I <em>think</em> I was at around thirty-nine when November ended.</p>

<p>Between Netflix, HBO GO and Blu-rays from <a href="http://www.vulcanvideo.com/">Vulcan Video</a> I made a concerted effort to close the gap through December.</p>

<p>As a quick workflow overview: I used Mike D’Angelo’s indispensible <a href="http://www.panix.com/~dangelo/nymaster.html">NYC master list</a> to determine which films opened this past year and loaded up my <a href="http://letterboxd.com/poritsky/watchlist/">Letterboxd watchlist</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I also copied D’Angelo’s complete list into <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner">OmniOutliner</a> to track which films I had seen and when; this came in handy organizing the below list.</p>

<p>As it stands now I have seen fifty-one films that opened in NYC in 2013 and two television movies that I think should count:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Steven Soderbergh’s <em>Behind the Candelabra</em> and Greg Mottola’s <em>Clear History</em>. There are some big titles I haven’t seen yet that I suspect would otherwise make their way onto my top ten list, like <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>, but the year is up.</p>

<p>So here it is, my top ten films of 2013.</p>

<p><strong>1. <em>Nebraska</em>, Alexander Payne</strong></p>

<p>Payne may be one of my favorite working comedy directors. His camera is patient and wide, allowing his actors generous breathing room for letting the dark, painful humor of life play out. Will Forte is the big surprise here: he plays an amazing straight man.</p>

<p>I love this movie.</p>

<p><strong>2. <em>Computer Chess</em>, Andrew Bujalski</strong></p>

<p><em>Computer Chess</em> is such a brilliant, beautiful, weird little film. I feel like I shouldn’t need to say anything more than “Bujalski” to get you to see it, but his films fly deep under the radar for most audiences which is a shame. I think he may be the most exciting American director to watch today. When I  <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/08/07/film-anxiety-and-legalese-an-interview-with-andrew-bujalski/">interviewed him in 2009</a>, Bujalski had shot all of his movies on film:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re trying to get video to look exactly like film, it’s a silly thing to do. You might as well just go and shoot on film anyway if you’re using the super high-end stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Computer Chess</em> was shot on a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/movies/andrew-bujalski-talks-about-the-look-of-his-computer-chess.html">Sony AVC-3260</a> and it looks gorgeous. </p>

<p><strong>3. <em>Dealin’ With Idiots</em>, Jeff Garlin</strong></p>

<p>Jeff Garlin laughing incredulously at things and talking in a high-pitched voice is my hero. </p>

<p><em>Dealin’ With Idiots</em> is a showcase for comic performers like Richard Kind, J.B. Smoove and Gina Gershon. The premise is thin (Garlin’s Max Morris decides to interview other parents on his son’s little league baseball team for a potential film project) but the jokes are honest and never let up. I haven’t laughed this hard this consistently at a film in a long time. And it all comes together in the end in a way that just crushed me. Truly.</p>

<p><strong>4. <em>Frances Ha</em>, Noah Baumbach</strong></p>

<p>Greta Gerwig plays an incredible <a href="http://term.ly/shlemiel">shlemiel</a>, which is good because Baumbach really puts her character, Frances, through the ringer. It’s starting to get annoying how good he is at composing these painful comedies about characters coming to terms with responsible adulthood. </p>

<p><strong>5. <em>Stoker</em>, Park Chan-wook</strong></p>

<p>A truly creepy and patient film. Park wisely lets the film unfold in emotional, not temporal, order. Mia Wasikowska proves to be a formidable talent. <em>Stoker</em> can be uncomfortable at times but remember: it’s horror. Nice to be reminded that not everything in the genre relies on creatures jumping out of the shadows and killers sidling up in mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>6. <em>This Is the End</em>, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen</strong></p>

<p>Easily one of the funniest films of the year. Rogen and Goldberg put together an oddly affecting film that is also a stoner apocalypse supernatural popcorn flick. Not easily pulled off.</p>

<p><strong>7. <em>The Bling Ring</em>, Sofia Coppola</strong></p>

<p>It’s voyeurism all the way down in <em>The Bling Ring</em>. To watch it is to participate in the modern obsession with the self(-ie). At first we follow the young thieves on their celebrity exploits but eventually we learn that it is we, via Coppola’s camera, who are looking in on the lives of others and leering.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to think this is a film about a specific generation’s proclivities toward mimesis; it’s about us, the audience, no matter the age.</p>

<p><strong>8. <em>This Is Martin Bonner</em>, Chad Hartigan</strong></p>

<p>A great character piece that dives deep into the lives of two men trying to start their lives over. Paul Eenhoorn and Richmond Arquette give nuanced performances that really show a love for the men they portray. Hartigan is clearly capable of great comedic setups, but his restraint pays off tenfold in <em>This Is Martin Bonner</em>.</p>

<p><strong>9. <em>Prince Avalanche</em>, David Gordon Green</strong></p>

<p>David Gordon Green’s progression as a filmmaker continues to be astounding to watch. I think it’s too easy to see his stoner comedies (<em>Pineapple Express</em>, <em>Your Highness</em>) as stumbling blocks and equally myopic to view <em>Prince Avalanche</em> as a return to form (like his quieter films <em>George Washington</em> or <em>All the Real Girls</em>). Instead this fantastical Texas tale feels like a culmination of Green’s craft. And Paul Rudd shows off some serious chops too.</p>

<p><strong>10. <em>You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet</em>, Alain Resnais</strong></p>

<p>Theater. Reality. Cinema. Memory. These are just a few of the themes that come to mind while watching Alain Resnais’ <em>You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet</em>, about a group of actors convening to mourn the death of a playwright. Give yourself over to this one and you will be rewarded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We already have extremely powerful devices that we’re barely using the potential of — we don’t need to divide our attention and resources further to add new device categories to our lives that aren’t massively better in normal use than what we already have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part I agree,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I do think we are approaching the full potential of handheld devices.</p>

<p>The next logical step is more screens in more places. Look at automobile telematics, for example. Even that 60s-futuristic name, “telematics,” stinks. Auto-makers simply cannot build a dashboard that’s half-good, which is the reason <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/">iOS in the Car</a> exists (or almost exists).</p>

<p>A blank screen whose interface is driven by the device you bring with you. More screens like that and we’ll really see what this tech can do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://moviecitynews.com/2013/12/why-im-not-going-to-sundance-this-year/">David Poland</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have asked virtually nothing of Sundance in all of these years, except for a press badge worn by me and thousands of other journalists. And perhaps that’s the problem. I haven’t buddied up to the right people, hung out at parties with the programmers, or sponsored something. But that is not my way. I have no disrespect for those who cover festivals this way… but all-in-all, I would rather see another movie than spend a couple of hours having dinner (at least before Day 6 or 7).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Festival access is a dark art that working your ass off to cover movies isn’t a part of. Sucks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week Information Architects (iA) released Writer Pro, a follow-up to the company’s popular text editor, iA Writer. By far, their most heavily touted new feature is Syntax Control. Oliver Reichenstein, iA’s director, promised in <a href="http://ia.net/blog/writer-pro/">a blog post</a> to vigorously protect this new feature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Syntax Control is a solid innovation, one we’ve been working on for more than four years. As with every serious design, once you have seen how it works, you can figure out cheap ways to copy it. We’ve trademarked and obtained patent pending for Syntax Control. If you want it in your text editor, you can get a license from us. It’s going to be a fair deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve read this paragraph probably a dozen times now and I can think of no better word to describe it than “<a href="http://gawker.com/on-smarm-1476594977">smarmy</a>.” It’s not just the bravado in Reichenstein’s insistence that Syntax Control is such a solid innovation, it’s the pre-emptive accusation that any similar feature in an app would be “cheap.” This isn’t just an insult, it’s a threat.</p>

<p>When I hand my money over to a developer, I want to at least <em>feel</em> like I’m the reason their product exists, that it otherwise wouldn’t but for my interest, support and cash. Goading other developers into forking over licensing fees undercuts that feeling for me. While the full patent application isn’t available yet, Reichenstein <a href="https://twitter.com/reichenstein/status/414932666387927040">tweeted</a> an image that has “Method of editing text in a text editor” listed as the “Title of Invention.” That sounds precisely like the sort of broad software patent that discourages innovation. </p>

<p>But then there’s Syntax Control itself. I can’t figure out what, exactly, the innovation <em>is</em>. Here’s how iA describes Syntax Control on their <a href="http://writer.pro">product page</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Syntax Control dims everything but the chosen syntax, helping you focus, and control your writing style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the Writer Pro <a href="http://support.iawriter.com/help/discussions/writer-pro-for-mac-problems/6-do-writing-modes-only-change-the-cursor-color-and-font#comment_30701362">support forums</a>, Oli Studholme speaks for iA in responding to early adopters unhappy with the app (emphasis not mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While we understand Writer Pro is not for everyone, I’m very surprised to hear you say it does “nothing new”. Regardless of your thoughts on Workflow, <em>Syntax Control is not available in any other program, period.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about Agile Tortoise’s <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/phraseology/">Phraseology</a>? That two year-old app has a feature called “Inspect” that offers comprehensive statistics about your document like word count and readability. There is also a parts of speech analysis.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/12/phraseology-inspect.jpg" title="Phraseology's Inspect View" /></p>

<p>Had Agile Tortoise threatened action against anyone who would try to copy Phraseology’s Inspect view, would we even <em>have</em> Writer Pro’s Syntax Control?</p>

<p>All of this leads me to the conclusion that I should stop supporting Information Architects and I suggest you do the same. I bought iA Writer for the Mac and iOS long ago, but from here on out, unless Reichenstein and company do an about face, I won’t be giving them a dime. If you like the typefaces they include with their apps, go buy them from <a href="http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/">Bold Monday</a> and <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/">Klim Type Foundry</a>. If you need a text editor there are plenty of others available from less threatening developers. Here are some ideas:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phraseology/id484666152?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">Phraseology</a></li>

</ul>

<p>There is no need to support a smarmy, litigious operation like Information Architects. There is so much innovation coming out of other developers. Now get writing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> Gabe Weatherhead <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/12/writer-pro-developers-double-down-on-innovations-in-being-douchebags.html">nails it</a>, Ben Brooks <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/isue/">offers some insight</a>, The Soulmen whip up <a href="https://github.com/macguru/SyntaxCheck">a demo</a> showing how simple it is to recreate Syntax Control and Verge forum poster “Weswanders” does the hard work of <a href="http://theverge.com/2013/12/21/5234580/patent-pending-ias-militant-stance-on-syntax-control">questioning iA’s claims</a> that The Verge sidestepped <a href="http://theverge.com/2013/12/18/5222948/ia-writer-pro">in this piece</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED December 26, 2013:</strong> This evening, after a <a href="http://storify.com/poritsky/discussion-from-twitterrific-5">public conversation</a> with David Heinemeier Hansson, iA’s official Twitter account (managed by Oliver Reichenstein) tweeted the following:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We will drop our patents pending. Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">@dhh</a> for clearing our minds.</p>&mdash; iA Inc. (@iA) <a href="https://twitter.com/iA/statuses/416393539182796800">December 27, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Sounds good to me. I look forward to reading Reichenstein’s side of this.</p>

      <p>A brief postscript to all of this because I don’t want to write a separate piece.</p>

      <p>I wish both the press beta and the negative review were as prevalent in the software world as they are in the film world. Most movies, except for the real stinkers, are shown to the press ahead of time with the full knowledge that many of them won’t like what they see. And they’re going to <em>tell</em> people so.</p>

      <p>The iA forums and iTunes reviews are lousy with people crying foul because Writer Pro wasn’t what they were expecting. I wonder if a launch day <a href="http://macstories.net">Macstories</a> longread on the specifics of what the app can and can’t do wouldn’t have changed Writer Pro’s early sales. Come to think of it, I don’t think iA even offered a press beta.</p>

      <p>Remember: it’s the stinkers that don’t screen early for the critics.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jason Kottke <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/the-blog-is-dead/">at Nieman Journalism Lab</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of blogging, people are posting to Tumblr, tweeting, pinning things to their board, posting to Reddit, Snapchatting, updating Facebook statuses, Instagramming, and publishing on Medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this sentence I think Jason gets closest to expressing what Medium is to those who don’t get it.</p>

<p>He closes with the same warning <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/12/16/medium-confusion/">I offer whenever I talk about Medium</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past 16 years, the blog format has evolved, had social grafted onto it, and mutated into Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest and those new species have now taken over. No biggie, that’s how technology and culture work. <strong>If you want something to cry about, cry about the decline of the open web,</strong> the death of which would be a huge blow for us all. But perhaps that’s a topic better left for 2015.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Soulmen, developers of <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/04/09/ulysses-iii-review/">Ulysses III</a> and <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2011/06/02/daedalus-touch-brings-beautiful-text-editing-to-the-ipad/">Daedalus Touch</a>, never fail to impress. They just updated Daedalus, the universal iOS text editor, to 1.7 and brought a slew of goodies to it. The headlining features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Daedalus Touch is now free with In-App Purchase
    <ul>
      <li>Users who paid for the app in the past will get all features unlocked on download</li>
      <li>$2.99 gets you all of the features or you can piecemeal only what you need for $0.99 apiece</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The app requires iOS 7 and has been redesigned for the current OS as well</li>
  <li>Updated to the latest <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander/id326180690?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">TextExpander</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> SDK</li>
  <li>New support for <a href="http://x-callback-url.com">x-callback-url</a></li>
  <li>The ability to customize fonts</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on about this app, but I want to just focus on the custom font selections as this is something that wasn’t immediately clear to me and seems revolutionary on iOS.</p>

<p>Daedalus Touch has always had three font choices: Classic, Modern and Mono. In previous iterations of the app The Soulmen bundled custom fonts with the app. Each sheet (or document) features a title line in a large, headline-style typeface above the body text.</p>

<p>In 1.7 Daedalus retains the names of the old themes but now relies solely on built-in iOS fonts: Cochin, Helvetica Neue and Menlo. Below the font options there is a toggle labeled “Custom.” Flip it and you now have the option of setting both the title and the body text to any iOS system font.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/12/daedalus-settings.png" title="Daedalus Touch Settings" /></p>

<p>Now, this is cool, but it’s not revolutionary for an iOS text app to allow you access to the system font library. While I was enjoying myself flipping through different theme options, I noticed a tweet from the Daedalus twitter account.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>For those of you fiddling with the fonts feature: You can have *any* font file (even .zips) “Open In Daedalus”. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23daedalusapp&amp;src=hash">#daedalusapp</a></p>&mdash; Daedalus Touch (@daedalusapp) <a href="https://twitter.com/daedalusapp/statuses/413465364371374080">December 19, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Immediately I dropped a font into my Dropbox folder on my Mac and loaded Dropbox on my iPhone. I downloaded the font and used Dropbox’s share button to get to the “Open in…” dialog. Tap Daedalus and it will open up. At first it will be unclear that anything happened. Go back into the custom fonts selection menu and there, at the top of the list, will be your font.</p>

<p>Even better, as promised you can zip up all the weights of a font and open it in Daedalus. All of the weights will be available and organized.</p>

<p>iOS ships with a wide array of fonts that should keep most users happy, but it’s extremely nice to be able to load any font I want to write with. I loaded up my preferred monospaced fonts (<a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/01/29/dancing-couriers/">and favorite of the dancing Couriers</a>), <a href="http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/">Courier Prime</a> and <a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/pitch-design-information/">Pitch</a>, both of which look gorgeous in Daedalus.</p>

<p>Many of the writing apps I love ship with custom fonts, some of which I love and wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> However, the ability to load your own fonts is a huge win from a consumer perspective. So many apps differentiate themselves on an array of features; I’d rather not have to choose app A solely because it has a font that app B doesn’t.</p>

<p>One final thought on the matter. Plain text editing is one thing, but imagine being able to load custom fonts in a layout app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">Keynote</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">Pages</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnigraffle/id363225984?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">OmniGraffle</a>. I really hope The Soulmen share this code and make iOS an even more customizable landscape.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daedalus-touch-text-editor/id406964546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">Daedalus Touch</a> is free with In-App Purchase in the App Store. It’s a great syncing companion to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses-iii/id623795237?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">Ulysses III</a>, which is $44.99 in the Mac App Store.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>R. Kelly’s sexual predation has been underreported for over a decade. Jim DeRogatis, in conversation with Jessica Hopper at <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/12/read_the_stomac.php">The Village Voice</a>, explains how he approached the story from the beginning and why Kelly’s sins are not as easily forgivable as much of the music world would have you believe.</p>

<p>This bit is important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of people who are critics are fans and don’t come with any academic background, with any journalistic background, research background. Now, nobody knows everything, and far be it from me to say you’ve got to be a journalist or you have to have studied critical theory in the academy. Part of what we do is journalistic. Get the names right, get the dates right, get the facts right. Sometimes, on a very rare number of stories, there’s a deeper level of reporting required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not know how to report, but you should know how to read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, my pal <a href="https://twitter.com/noahjnelson">Noah J. Nelson</a> attracted the attention of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/12/medium">John Gruber</a> with his piece (published both <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/2013/12/11/what-medium-is-for/">at Turnstyle News</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/nelsons-errata/c100ebe0158f">on Medium</a>) “What Medium Is For.” Noah’s piece doesn’t quite answer the question “What is Medium and who is it for?” but it does help articulate why its critics (<a href="https://medium.com/p/f8a0d19bf003">like myself</a>) seem baffled by its very existence. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can say, unequivocally, that as a writer who has published on Medium and who isn’t being paid by that company, that I’ve extracted a good amount of value from its methods of exposure. There’s something magical about seeing Twitter arguments erupt about one of your own posts in Portuguese. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Noah, in this instance, value is exposure, attention. Medium is the amplifier that allows his words to be read the world over. He is reaching new readers and starting a conversation with Medium’s unique paragraph-specific comments.</p>

<p>My question, though, is: then what? You can make a name for yourself with exposure, but you can’t pay rent with it.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not paying rent with the candler blog, either. But it’s mine. Everything that appears on this site, every last pixel, is here because I want it to be here. It’s my own little home on the web and if I want to turn it into my day job I could roll up my sleeves and give that a try. The same can’t be said for Medium. Yet.</p>

<p>So what, then, we all throw up our arms and ask, <em>is</em> Medium for?</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/nelsons-errata/c100ebe0158f#9196-456da091346a">comment</a> Noah gets closer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medium is the layer underneath the content. They are attempting to build a better mousetrap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “layer underneath the content” used to be known as the open web: HTML, CSS, RSS etc., etc. Medium wants to be that. Medium wants to be the whole Internet.</p>

<p>This is not uncommon today. The modern startup has no interest in contributing to the open web. The goal instead is to bring users into your tent and keep them there; to build, as Noah aptly puts it, a better mousetrap.</p>

<p>Anil Dash’s year-old piece, “<a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">The Web We Lost</a>,” provides brilliant insight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know that Facebook and Twitter and Pinterest and LinkedIn and the rest are great sites, and they give their users a lot of value. […] But they’re based on a few assumptions that aren’t necessarily correct. The primary fallacy that underpins many of their mistakes is that user flexibility and control necessarily lead to a user experience complexity that hurts growth. And the second, more grave fallacy, is the thinking that exerting extreme control over users is the best way to maximize the profitability and sustainability of their networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is something destructive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in Medium’s vertically integrated long form writing and publishing platform. I recognize the value to the reader, but not the writer. You’re putting your blood and sweat and time into someone else’s platform for free and getting nothing but attention and a supposed following in return.</p>

<p>I think Medium’s most nefarious conceit is that they pay some contributors at “<a href="https://medium.com/medium-writers-guide/7838df60bab2">competitive freelance rates.</a>” Here’s how I <a href="https://medium.com/p/f8a0d19bf003">put it recently</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if I told you you could be published alongside writers from (but not in) <em>The New Yorker</em> for the low low price of free? In a nut, that’s Medium: a slick, magazine-like publishing and reading platform that writers should be so lucky to contribute to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paid writers bring their clout to Medium, the platform, in order to convince unwitting writers that they should contribute to Medium, the magazine, for free. The paid authors are thus pied pipers of a sort, luring not the readers but the <em>writers</em> out of the web and into Medium.</p>

<p>If I were to cross-post an article both here and on Medium, I’d kick myself should the Medium post get linked to by Daring Fireball. John Gruber boasts a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/">formidable following</a>: 200,000 RSS subscribers, 60,000 Twitter followers and an estimated four to five million page views a month. He drives a significant amount of traffic to any site he links, but his readers are unique. They’re engaged, interested and loyal. Unlike traffic drawn from, say, Digg or Facebook or BuzzFeed, a link from the likes of Gruber tends to turn into a lasting relationship. The readers will come and interact and, perhaps, stick around. For my efforts it seems a shame to have that relationship forged under Medium’s logo.</p>

<p>Perhaps Medium is the ultimate signal booster. Maybe Gruber would never have happened upon Noah’s piece had it not been for Medium’s amplification. But Daring Fireball has been linking to interesting content for over a decade; before Facebook, before Twitter, and, obviously, before Medium.</p>

<p>So did Noah’s piece attract Gruber’s attention? Or did Medium? In the attention transaction that occurs when readers land on his piece, who reaps the benefits? I’m willing to bet Medium does. As a writer, that seems like a big thing to give up for free.</p>
