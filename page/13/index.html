  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joe Marine <a href="http://nofilmschool.com/2013/08/black-betty-si-2k-mini-digital-cinema-camera/">over at nofilmschool</a> reveals the Black Betty camera:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Black Betty is much more than a camera. It’s a complete cinema solution utilizing an Apple Mac Mini computer with a Silicon Imaging SI-2K Mini for the imager. It also happens to be the first single unit camera in existence capable of shooting, editing, and posting footage online, without the need for any other hardware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Joe and the Black Betty team are over-playing this “shoot and edit” capability. Basically the video is recorded to the Mac Mini, so technically you could plug a monitor into it and cut away, but that sounds inconvenient.</p>

<p>However, Joe’s interview with the camera’s creators Adam Van Voorhis and Mike Szegedithey hints at some of the things one <em>could</em> do with the Black Betty, which is where things get interesting. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adam: […] There’s nothing stopping you from taking Bluetooth keyboards and Bluetooth mice, and using them to do things like trigger the camera remotely. I’ve triggered the camera from hundreds of feet away with a Bluetooth mouse and it works, and that’s damn cool.</p>

  <p>Mike: Since it’s an Apple device, you could probably use Apple devices to trigger it.</p>

  <p>Adam: Sure. Anything that you can do with a Mac Mini, you can do with the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wi-Fi. Bluetooth. This is starting to sound like a camera that could make my old <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/05/google-wave-for-filmmakers-a-concept/">Google Wave for Filmmakers</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> concept possible.</p>

<p>Mac Minis turn up in so many creative places; it may be one of Apple’s best devices simply in terms of the scope of the projects it has made possible.</p>

      <p>Google Wave may be dead, but my original proposal was for a collaborative online hub where a project’s XML file could be cut by multiple editors.

<p>Welcome to Hindsight, a weekly collection of year-old great writing from around the Web.</p>

<p>When I got it in my head that I should revisit content from last year, I wasn’t sure what I might find. After all, there is so much great content being published <em>right now</em>. Why dwell in the past? This exercise isn’t about nostalgia, though; it’s about catching up on the trove of writing that gets lost in the daily shuffle.</p>

<p>The goal here is to break the news cycle, to leave behind the conversations of the day and learn something new. It’s impossible to read everything on the Web, but it seems wasteful to read only what is new. With that in mind, I’ve collected what I think are some of the most interesting stories from this week last year. Happy reading.</p>

<p>You can subscribe <a href="http://feedpress.me/hindsight">just to Hindsight posts</a> or to the <a href="http://feedpress.me/candlerblog">full feed of <em>the candler blog</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="hindsight-1-----august-26---september-1-2012">Hindsight 1 — August 26 - September 1, 2012</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/26/how-to-watch-an-art-movie-reel-1/">“How to watch an art movie, reel 1”</a> by David Bordwell, <em>Observations on film art</em>, August 26, 2012</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime Rosales’ <em>Sueño y silencio</em> premiered in the Directors Fortnight at Cannes this year, went into distribution in Spain recently, and will probably be making the festival rounds. I think it’s a good film, but my appraisal is beside my point today. I want to use the film as a sort of “tutor-text,” a handy way of talking about how such movies engage us in ways different from more mainstream films.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2342317/"><em>Sueño y silencio</em></a> has not been released in the US yet, but Bordwell writes in a manner that makes seeing the film beside the point. Shot by shot, he walks the reader through the experience of learning how to watch a film based on cues from the filmmaker.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.oxfordamerican.org/articles/2012/aug/27/new-south-journalism-fracking-investigation/">“Backyard Battlefields: The bloody business of fracking in Arkansas.”</a> by J. Malcolm Garcia, <em>Oxford American</em>, August 27, 2012</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Natural gas is being marketed as a clean, green alternative to foreign-oil dependency; this year, the International Energy Agency found that carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. fell by four hundred and fifty tons, the result of an increase in the use of natural gas instead of coal. But since the inception of widespread fracking in 1997, horror stories have slowly entered the national conscience: illnesses coinciding with contaminated wells, citizens who can light their tap water on fire, pet and livestock deaths, exploding houses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think I could live with the noise of fracking, let alone with the particulates, headaches and rashes the people in Garcia’s piece have experienced. And that’s not even the worst of it…</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/why-johnny-cant-stream-how-video-copyright-went-insane/">“Why Johnny can’t stream: How video copyright went insane”</a> by James Grimmelmann, <em>Ars Technica</em>, August 30, 2012</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the story of <em>Cablevision</em>, the companies that followed in its wake, and how we got to the strange place where wasting resources on thousands of tiny antennas made you legal—but where using one antenna broke the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grimmelmann does his best to untangle the Gordian knot that is American copyright law and explain why video streaming remains wildly inefficient.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/letters-essays/6146/letter-from-majorca-j-d-daniels">“Letter from Majorca”</a> by J. D. Daniels, <em>The Paris Review</em>, Summer 2012</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    It was at this time that the captain called me long-distance from Tunisia and said, “I need a man. Get over here.”<br />
    “I’m sick,” I said. “I don’t know how much help I can be to you.”<br />
    “All I need is arms and legs,” he said. “Do you still have arms and legs?…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entering Daniels’ mind makes for quite the journey.</p>

<h3 id="further-back">Further Back</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/08/60141?currentPage=all">“Turn Back the Spam of Time”</a> by Brian Mcwilliams, <em>Wired</em>, August 29, 2003</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A trail of Internet clues has fingered Robert “Robby” Todino as the source of the time-travel messages. In a telephone interview last week, the 22-year-old Woburn, Massachusetts, resident admitted that he has sent nearly 100 million of the bizarre messages since November 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like the basis for the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1862079/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>Safety Not Guarunteed</em></a>, which, oddly, is actually based on a <a href="http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/silveira125.html"><em>different</em> real-life tale</a>. <strong>Further Reading:</strong> At least one blogger <a href="http://www.inertramblings.com/2003/07/28/no-dimensional-warp-generator-for-me/">documented the scene</a> in Woburn, Massachusetts on July 28, 2003, when and where Todino claimed a Dimensional Warp Generator was to be delivered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/08/hindsight.png" title="Hindsight" /></p>

<p>Last week, Shawn Blanc published an <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/08/feed-reading-today-and-tomorrow/">excellent piece</a> on the state of RSS feed reading. Here’s the part that stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is <em>so much</em> great stuff being written and published every day. We’re subscribing to some of the sites and writers who are producing it, and we’re trying to read what we can, but a lot of great things to read fall through the cracks every day. And a lot of dumb stuff gets much more attention than it deserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I save interesting things I come across to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> every day. As I <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/05/31/readkit-2-and-rediscovering-instapaper/">explained back in May</a>, sometimes I read the articles I cull, but more often they linger in my accounts until they’re forgotten, tamped down by another layer of links I might one day get to. And yes, I as guilty as anyone of getting caught up in nonsense that doesn’t deserve my attention at all.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Shawn’s piece got me thinking about what I could do to prevent great content from getting lost over time. And then it hit me: just read it.</p>

<p>Today I’m introducing Hindsight, a weekly collection of older content you may have missed from around the Web. Hindsight will be published once a week and contain links to longer stories that are one year old. Some ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linked articles should have been published within the same numbered week of the previous year.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>At least one story a week should be ten years old or older.</li>
  <li>Stories should be at least one thousand words long.</li>
  <li>Stories should be fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(journalism)">evergreen</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules will be broken, probably weekly, but I think they provide a nice starting point. Hindsight is about slowing down the news cycle. It’s about setting current events aside and catching up on great writing.</p>

<p>Hindsight will appear like any other post here on <em>the candler blog</em>. I’ve also set up an <a href="http://feedpress.me/hindsight" title="Hindsight Feed">RSS feed just for Hindsight</a>.</p>

<p>So fire up your read later app of choice and grab your favorite beverage; the <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2013/08/28/hindsight-1/" title="Hindsight 1">first Hindsight is up</a>. Happy reading.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>This week is a great example: I’ve been privy to far too many conversations about Miley Cyrus. Meanwhile: the NSA is spying on the UN and we’re on the brink of entering Syria, but OMG that foam finger.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Numbered weeks are based on a Sunday through Saturday calendar.

<p>It only just occurred to me that I haven&rsquo;t officially introduced readers of <em>the candler blog</em> to <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/tag/the-crowdcrowd/">The CrowdCrowd</a>, a podcast my pal Noah J Nelson over at <a href="http://turnstylenews.com">Turnstyle</a> started and which I&rsquo;ve been a regular guest on since its first episode in May.</p>

<p>Each week the panel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> convenes to discuss the week in crowdfunding news and developments. I was initially skeptical about just how much we could discuss, but we are far from the well running dry on topics.</p>

<p>We filed our <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/2013/08/23/the-crowdcrowd-episode-12/">twelfth episode</a> last week. Topics include the negative reactions to Spike Lee&rsquo;s successful Kickstarter campaign, how we measure the success of media created online, new crowdfunding platforms and getting paid to do what others do for free.</p>

<p>The CrowdCrowd is broadcast live on YouTube via a Google Hangout every Thursday at (roughly) 8:15pm Eastern, 5:15pm Pacific.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Audio episodes are posted Friday mornings. You can subscribe to the show in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thecrowdcrowds-podcast/id652698297">iTunes</a> or via <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/thecrowdcrowd">RSS</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://webinhq.com/blog/brand-new-icon-sharing-and-more/">ReadKit got an update</a> yesterday that added sharing options, more granular control over smart folders and a new icon. The biggest improvement I’ve seen though is that it is finally stable at syncing RSS feeds with my <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a> install.</p>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2013/05/31/readkit-2-and-rediscovering-instapaper/">ReadKit back in May</a>, I said that it was “unusable as a Mac Fever RSS client for me.” That’s not the case anymore. I’m not using my <a href="http://www.fluidapp.com">Fluid</a> Fever app now; ReadKit is it.</p>

<p>ReadKit is still <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readkit/id588726889?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l5Fb">only $4.99 on the Mac App Store</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and it syncs with almost every new RSS service <em>and</em> read later service <em>and</em> bookmarking service. It’s turning into a lynchpin of online reading.</p>

  <p>During the course of his research on the <em>Breaking Bad</em> section, Martin was allowed to hang out in the writers’ room during the making of season four of the show, where he occasionally snapped a few photographs […] he’s been nice enough to share some of those photos with us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s always neat to see how creative people work. Corkboards full of index cards, schematics of important settings and a shelf of books on crime and science got the <em>Breaking Bad</em> writers through one of the truly great seasons in television. Love this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/08/editorial-bold.png" title="Editorial for iPad" /></p>

<p>Last week Ole Zorn released <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/index.html" title="Editorial for iPad">Editorial</a>, a text editor for iPad loaded with all sorts of customizable automation workflows. Put on a pot of coffee or grab a growler of beer and spend some time with Federico Viticci’s <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/" title="Reinventing iOS Automation: Editorial Review">epic review over at MacStories</a> and/or Gabe Weatherhead’s <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/08/editorial-for-ipad-a-landmark-in-ios-text-editors.html" title="Editorial for iPad: A Landmark in iOS Text Editors">bescreencasted walkthrough at Macdrifter</a>.</p>

<p>Editorial is only <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Oajfc*AWWvY&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=5573&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Feditorial%2Fid673907758" title="Editorial for iPad - iTunes Affiliate Link">$4.99 cheap so go get it</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Even before you go down the nerd rabbit hole and begin unleashing the power of Editorial it’s an awesome text editor worth well over a crisp Lincoln. I bought Editorial the moment it came out and have been playing with it a bit. I’m not sure yet if it’s going to replace the rest of the apps I’ve been using on iPad, but I wanted to share my first impressions on some of its core features.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>Editorial’s interface is surprisingly clean given the breadth of its features. Launching it will bring up the text editor; swipe left to reveal the file browser, swipe right to reveal a tabbed interface for Markdown preview, console, help documents and the built in Web browser.</p>

<p>But the real charm of Editorial’s design is just how deep it goes. Every button, every menu, every window is carefully considered. One of my favorites you have to see to appreciate is what happens when you Delete an action in the Edit Workflow window. It’s a two-tap process with very thoughtful animations.</p>

<p>Zorn gets extra bonus points for including the bold and italic versions of fonts for Markdown preview (both inline and in the preview window). He even included an italic version of Inconsolata.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Most other Markdown apps I’ve used will simply render the standard typeface as needed, but adding a slant to a typeface does <em>not</em> make it truly italic. Small, deliberate decisions like that are sprinkled throughout, and they make Editorial a joy to use. </p>

<h3 id="dropbox-version-history">Dropbox Version History</h3>

<p>Editorial taps into Dropbox’s built in document version history allowing you to view a diff of any two versions of your file. From there you can restore an older edit. There is great potential for this to become a useful, perhaps even invaluable feature. In practice right now, though, it’s a bit clunky.</p>

<p>The main difficulty I’ve run into is that a document will continuously save while I’m working on it. I’m not sure if this is because the Dropbox app on my Mac is always running, thus always syncing even as I write on my iPad, but the result is a new version almost every minute. When choosing a version to view or revert to, there is no context for which version you want to view, just a timestamp.</p>

<p>This could be useful when a disaster happens, if you lose data or if you deleted something a day ago that you shouldn’t have. But, again, in practice this isn’t how I use version history. If there were a way to limit the amount of versions saved or a way to trigger a version at a specific point in time (akin to a git commit) then I could see this version viewer being much more useful.</p>

<h3 id="workflows">Workflows</h3>

<p>Workflows are the centerpiece feature of Editorial.  Federico and Gabe featured some great, downloadable examples in their aforelinked reviews, and Ole posted <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/workflows.html" title="Editorial for iPad – Workflows">a collection of some of the best on the app’s landing page</a>. The power of Workflows cannot be understated: there is no other iOS text editor that allows you to manipulate text the way that Editorial does (and there likely won’t be another for some time).</p>

<p>However, there is a very steep learning curve to crafting your own Workflows. Editorial comes with a wide array of actions to use on your text, but the most powerful Workflows involve Python scripting. Being that I don’t know Python (beyond <code>print "Hello world"</code> which I was rather proud of) diving into the Workflow editor is a bit slow and daunting for me.  I’ve no one to blame but myself, of course; if I want better workflows I’d better <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/" title="The Python Tutorial">learn Python</a>.</p>

<p>Still, I can’t help but wish some of the functions performed by Workflows could have been built right into the app, like this excellent <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5144752345317376/CRuhgQSwL7U" title="Editorial Workflow — FindReplace">Find and Replace</a> Workflow Federico made. Editorial has great, built-in document search. Using a Workflow that relies on alert-style search boxes that don’t allow you to view the document or what you’re replacing while it runs feels too far out of place. That said: at least I can do it.</p>

<p>The possibilities are almost endless with Workflows and I’m excited to see a little community of Workflow sharing pop up. I just wish I knew more Python…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> </p>

<h3 id="text-selection">Text Selection</h3>

<p>Here’s how Federico described Ole’s customized text selection in his review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In most iPad apps, selecting text when the keyboard is shown and then dismissing the keyboard results in losing the selection; Editorial has a custom selection engine that allows you to select text as you normally would when the keyboard is shown, but also to dismiss the keyboard, keep the selection, and tap the dimmed selection again to bring up the keyboard without losing the selection at all. When the selection is dimmed, you can do anything that you can typically do with a non-custom selection, such as extend it and copy text. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very cool feature in that it allows you to run Workflows on selected text even when the Keyboard is dismissed. This is most useful when you want to look up a URL in the browser from which to create a Markdown link. You can select your text then swipe over to the browser, dismissing the keyboard. Navigate to the URL you want, swipe back to the text editor and use Federico’s <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/6258007868440576/-PjiU8b7VOw" title="Editorial Workflow — Links">Links</a> Workflow and, bam, you’ve got a link.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>However, and this is a big however for me, Editorial’s custom text selection comes at a price: the standard iOS gestures for selecting text didn’t all make it into the app. In most iOS text editing apps, double tapping a word selects it; double tapping and dragging allows you to expand the highlighted selection either before or after the selected word and quadruple tapping will select the whole target paragraph. These selection gestures, <em>especially</em> double-tap-and-drag, are gestures I use daily when writing on iOS. Unless I have a bluetooth keyboard I’m lost without them.</p>

<p>In order to select more than one word of text in Editorial (today) you have to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a single word by double tapping it</li>
  <li>Release the touchscreen</li>
  <li>Grab one of the holders on either end of the highlighted word and expand the selection</li>
</ol>

<p>In my experience so far the double tap to select gesture is somewhat of a mixed bag; sometimes I can’t get it to activate depending on what I’m trying to highlight. In those instances I need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tap-and-hold to bring up the loupe tool</li>
  <li>Place the cursor on or near the desired word selection</li>
  <li>Release the touchscreen</li>
  <li>Wait for the pop-up selection menu to appear</li>
  <li>Tap “Select”</li>
  <li>Grab one of the holders on either end of the highlighted word and expand the selection</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, listing the above steps may seem a bit extreme given that I’m only talking about a few seconds inconvenience, but this definitely adds much more friction to writing on iOS than I’m used to. It isn’t about the time, it’s about taking my mind off of my writing.</p>

<p>I’m honing in on and being critical of one (admittedly vital) aspect of text selection in Editorial, but I should mention one very neat addition. You can slide your fingers across the extra row of custom keys to move the cursor around. This is helpful when you only need to move around a few characters and don’t want to take your hands too far away from the keyboard. I thought it was a novelty at first but it’s growing on me.</p>

<h3 id="a-great-app-for-many">A Great App For Many</h3>

<p>I warmed to Editorial over the course of writing this post, which, yes, I wrote mostly in Editorial. Most of my writing is done in <a href="http://bit.ly/12dcIz4" title="Ulysses III - Affiliate Link">Ulysses III</a> on a Mac synced via iCloud to <a href="http://bit.ly/10RGWBf" title="Daedalus Touch - Affiliate Link">Daedalus</a> on iOS.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> In the past I’ve lost work synced On Dropbox, though more often I’d end up inundated with a folder full of “conflicted” copies of documents.</p>

<p>From the first moment I saw iCloud sync in use in <a href="http://bit.ly/10HJvJ3" title="iA Writer - Affiliate Link">iA Writer</a>, I knew it would be my preferred sync solution. Documents can be open everywhere and sync instantaneously. There is no worrying that a file may have been left open on another system, or that an edit made in one location caused a conflicted copy to appear in all locations. Dropbox sync works and it works well; in my experience iCloud sync simply works better. So it’s going to be hard to get me back into a Dropbox syncing text editor.</p>

<p>Still, in my testing Editorial works nicely (that is, if one is watchful of when and where documents are syncing) with the External Folders feature in Ulysses III which allows documents in a folder on the hard disk, in this case <code>~/Dropbox/Apps/Editorial/</code>, to be viewed and edited. There are some quirks to using this feature in Ulysses, but I can cover that in another post.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Editorial is a great app for some forms of writing. Nowadays I prefer my apps have more file organization, which is why I tend to reach for Daedalus or <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Oajfc*AWWvY&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=5573&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fvesper%2Fid655895325" title="Vesper - Affiliate Link">Vesper</a> lately.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> I’ve moved past a folder full of text documents hosted on Dropbox, or at least right now it’s not my preferred method for keeping my writings in order.</p>

<p>That said, Editorial is one killer text editor that will only get better as more people experiment with new and interesting workflows. I can’t wait to see where the community takes this one.</p>
