  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fast Company’s Austin Carr <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1843506/exclusive-redbox-instant-streaming-to-launch-alpha-testing-name-verizon-fios-exec-ceo">reporting on a joint venture</a> from Verizon and Redbox on Tuesday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The service will be launched in internal alpha testing today, followed by a beta program in the coming months before the streaming service goes live later this year. It will be branded Redbox Instant by Verizon; it will combine access to physical and digital content; and the [joint venture] will be led by newly appointed CEO Shawn Strickland, who previously worked as a vice president in Verizon’s FiOS business. Such a set up indicates the partnership will rely mostly on Redbox’s branding, which mimics competitors Netflix Instant and Amazon Instant, while taking advantage of Verizon’s network infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doug Stephen, <a href="http://canadian-fury.com/2012/07/24/redbox-and-verizons-redbox-instant-begins-internal-testing/">commenting on the news</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More players and more popularity also means more pressure on content providers to adopt alternative distribution. These are all great things for consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Competition <em>is</em> good for consumers, but I don’t think streaming is necessarily where we need more competition. In his excellent book, <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/pandora.php"><em>Pandora’s Digital Box</em></a>, David Bordwell makes a compelling argument that the film industry is run as an oligopoly, with the studios and major theater chains acting as rulers. For some time, the theater chains were even able to stifle streaming so as not to eat into their business model. Things are changing, but slowly.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we now have a preponderance of streaming services to choose from which yields mostly trepidation over which horse to bet on. Yes, in some cases these services compete on price and everybody wins with lower bills or better features. However, for the most part streaming services compete for exclusive content. All of a sudden we end up with two, three, four services we need to keep paying for every month.</p>

<p>Competition needs to happen at the top. Filmmakers and distributors need to challenge the studio system and get work out there that isn’t tied up in the awkward gerrymandering of streaming exclusivity. We can already stream six ways to Sunday, but if we really want to move into the future, we need to challenge those who make the films. <em>That</em> competition would be better for consumers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/2012/07/25/video-free-brooklyn/">interviewed my pal Aaron Hillis</a> about his new venture: a brick and mortar video rental store.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though Aaron didn’t give the store its call-to-arms name, he is clearly running with it as a theme. Video Free Brooklyn, in other words, feels like more than a store; it feels like a cause. “In comparison to Video Free Brooklyn, Netflix offers a sterile, impersonal and flat-out incomplete experience,” Hillis told me, speaking about his biggest competitor. The video store is meant to bring a certain sense of surprise, of curation and even whimsy back to the process of deciding, “What are we going to watch tonight?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a bit over a day left on his <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/vfb">Indiegogo campaign</a>. If you live near Cobble Hill, you’re definitely going to want to give at a level that yields some rentals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://sprw.me/">Google acquired Sparrow</a>, an excellent Mac and iOS email client that I have been using for months. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/20/3172222/google-buys-sparrow-mail">The Verge later confirmed</a> that the team does “not plan to release new features for the Sparrow apps.” As someone who was eagerly awaiting native push notifications for their iPhone app and the forthcoming Sparrow for iPad, I was a bit bummed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to hear that my favorite mail client had effectively been shut down.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/07/21/entitlement-and-acquisition/">Matt Gemmel posted a piece</a> that breaks down the many wrong-headed reactions to the acquisition and offers a bit of perspective on the indie dev business:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sparrow’s acquisition is a <em>success story</em>. Indie devs make a great product, build a customer-base, and are rewarded with a buy-out from a big company <em>and</em> they get new jobs with that company. It might not be what your particular goal or end-game is, but it <em>is</em> a success. I’m really happy for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I loved every word of his piece. Spot on, Matt.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>I have a very awkward relationship with Google. For the longest time I was convinced the company could do no wrong and that they were the company that made tools I want to use. That all took a nosedive around the time Eric Schmidt started <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/7951269/Young-will-have-to-change-names-to-escape-cyber-past-warns-Googles-Eric-Schmidt.html">saying weird things</a> about privacy. And so I’ve long tried to unhinge myself from their products, finding that I always come back to them in the end for this reason or that. When it comes to Gmail, Sparrow has been part of the reason I have stuck around.</p>

<p>Sparrow is really a Gmail client that also supports vanilla IMAP and POP accounts. With Sparrow, I never really had to worry about the oddities that creep up when using Apple Mail with a Gmail account. Drafts would always be saved to the right place, labels worked the way I wanted them to and archiving messages actually archived them reliably. Now I need to go back to Apple Mail and figure out how to make things work properly.</p>

<p>The app’s tight integration with Gmail makes Google’s acquisition a no-brainer. Yet it gives me pause. Google may use the talent at Sparrow to change Gmail’s mobile apps, or perhaps they will use them to make the web interface better. I don’t know. What I do know is that Sparrow’s current apps will depreciate fast, so I need to switch email clients. And that makes me want to reconsider why I’m sticking with Gmail anyway.</p>

<p>For now, I have my reasons to keep Gmail, but I’m shopping around, if you have any suggestions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>A gunman opened fire in a crowded movie theater in the Denver suburbs early Friday morning, killing at least 14 people and wounding dozens of others, the police told reporters in an early morning news conference.</p><p>The shooting erupted during midnight showings of “The Dark Night Rises” at the multiplex in Aurora, Colo., where throngs had gathered, some dressed as characters from the highly anticipated Batman sequel.</p><footer><strong>-J.

<p>I was nearly brought to tears reading this on my commute this morning.</p>

<p>Movie theaters are supposed to be holy places, where we can sit together in relative silence and be enterntained, educated or enlightened (or all three) for two hours or more. I don’t want to imagine a world in which people fear gathering publicly to enjoy something they love, but I don’t have to. For the people of Aurora, Colorado, that is now a horrific reality.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to the victims, their families, those wounded in the attack<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and those who witnessed it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/kane-kid.jpg" title="Still from Citizen Kane" /></p>

<p>Film’s death knell rings again, this time from the pen of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-ca-film-novelty-20120715,0,4176050.story">Neal Gabler at the LA Times</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Young people, so-called millennials, don’t seem to think of movies as art the way so many boomers did. They think of them as fashion, and like fashion, movies have to be new and cool to warrant attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we’re off. Where’s the proof, Neal?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are, unfortunately, no studies of which I am aware that examine the relationship of millennials to old movies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At best we have dated surveys about the antipathy of young people to black-and-white films. But MTV did conduct a study recently of how young people relate to contemporary films, which found that movies are deeply embedded in the social networking process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a sense that if you can’t tweet about it or post a comment about it on your Facebook wall, it has no value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>If Twitter and Facebook were around forty years ago, would baby boomers’ collective conversations have been any more insightful? I bet not. Lucky for Gabler, though, the only evidence of that laudable generation’s film experience comes from its greatest minds, in print.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, the most ardent movie enthusiasts of the past generation were reverential of old movies. Andrew Sarris, who died last month and who was among the nation’s most influential film critics in the ’70s and ’80s, made his reputation not just by importing the auteur theory from France that celebrated the authorial role of the director but by disinterring many of those old directors from film history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing all young peoples’ tweets to one of criticism’s greatest minds seems foolhardy, to say the least. But let’s hear what Gabler’s friends have to say.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another friend who teaches at a prestigious university told me that while a good number of his self-selected class of undergraduates studying film history did respond to many of the old films he showed, for example Hitchcock movies, they expressed only cold admiration for many other classic films, including “Citizen Kane,” which they found antiquated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well they should. It is over seventy years old, after all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And yet another friend, this one a high school teacher in California heading a film class, said his students were bored by “The Godfather.” He won’t be teaching the course again because there wasn’t sufficient interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve taught film to students from elementary school age straight on up to college, and I can tell you firsthand that young people need to be fed something more interesting than an AFI-compiled boomer-stroking greatest hits list. Film education needs to grow and change, not rely on the same stale syllabi that worked once upon a time. When you meet them where they are, you will be surprised by how exhilarated young people are by movies, even old ones.</p>

<p>Contrary to Gabler, the classics are not sacrosanct. Film history and appreciation is much more interesting than the accepted good taste of a bygone few. Preservation and the auteur theory didn’t always exist and are, quite possibly, unique to the baby boomer generation.</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that any of these elements of cinema culture be dismantled. Quite the opposite. In order for institutions like film education and preservation to survive, they must prove malleable enough to weather generational shifts. Otherwise Gabler’s greatest fears <em>will</em> come true, and future generations won’t know a wide shot from a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>Just because young people approach cinema differently than their parents and grandparents does not mean they’ve dissociated themselves from the art. If all you have to go on are social media posts and anecdotal yarns from colleagues who can’t keep a classroom interested, then yes, a very bleak picture of film’s state of affairs develops. But I like to think that there are more exciting things happening with young film goers and makers, even among those who can’t connect with <em>Citizen Kane</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As always, Stu Maschwitz offers some highly considered wisdom <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2012/7/16/gradually-falling-in-love-with-plain-text.html">on switching to a plain text workflow</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point of this article is simple: Don’t take my word for it that working with plain text is the best thing that ever happened to you. Or <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/why-geeks-love-plain-text-and-why-you-should-too.html">this guy’s</a>. Or <a href="http://matthewlowes.com/2011/10/08/plain-text-for-writers-part-i-an-argument-for-the-use-of-plain-text/">this guy’s</a>.</p>

  <p>The best thing I can do is gently lay out some of the reasons I love it. Go ahead: reject them. Fight back. Argue with me. This is one of those ideas that’s worth it.</p>

  <p>Then slowly discover plain text on your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant. Also noteworthy: Stu had only just learned Markdown when he conceived of Screenplay Markdown, which eventually became <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a>. That’s nuts.</p>

<p>John August responded to Stu <a href="http://johnaugust.com/2012/plain-text">with even more text wisdom</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re fighting to get Final Draft to recognize a parenthetical, you’re no longer writing. You’re formatting. You’re a poet picking fonts. You’re a novelist worrying about hyphenation.</p>

  <p>Plain text keeps you from worrying about the wrong things at the wrong time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are two very smart guys.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christopher Campbell makes an excellent point for the <a href="http://blog.documentarychannel.com/post/27342185520/criticizing-subjects">Documentary Channel’s Official Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as too often doc audiences <a href="http://www.movies.com/movie-news/doc-talk-when-it-okay-to-laugh-at-real-person/3610">laugh at a film’s subjects</a>, it’s also too often that critics and other writers focus on the mental state of real characters. And of course it hurts the subjects’ feelings, as we saw recently with Errol Morris’s <strong><em>Tabloid</em></strong>. […]</p>

  <p>It doesn’t matter if any of those responding are obvious attention seekers or if the subjects are seen by the majority of deserving or fitting the judgments and opinions. I just don’t think this stuff belongs in a film review. But then, reviewing documentaries is a very tricky task, and I at least understand why some critics aren’t always clear on what’s appropriate to focus on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said it’s an excellent point, though not one I necessarily agree with.</p>

<p>I’ll admit I haven’t seen any of the films in question in Campbell’s piece and I’ll further concede that no film writer is more plugged into doc culture than he is (at least no one I’ve ever read). Still, his stance seems a bit harsh. How can critics stem their opinions because it will hurt someone’s feelings?</p>

<p>Documentary subjects are real people with real feelings. However, when their lives are put on screen they become part of a film, one that can be like dissected, judged and, yes, criticized like any other. The onus, I would argue, is on the filmmaker to craft a character and a narrative. The subjects themselves could be completely different from who the filmmaker chooses to show us, and that’s why critics have a right, and perhaps even an obligation, to judge who and what they see onscreen.</p>

<p>Personal attacks should never be a part of criticism, but in documentaries we are not seeing the actual person who is at the center of the film. Instead it is a record of some facet, some period of their life, and it is very much shaped by the filmmaker’s perspective. When a critic opines one way or another,it is a judgement against the film and its maker.</p>

<p>Of course things get messy when a person’s life is thrown up on screen. In such cases, I think it’s best to turn to the filmmaker and question what went wrong. Not to his or her critics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/tweetbotegg.jpg" title="Tweetbot Casts a Long Dramatic Shadow" /></p>

<p>This week, Tapbots <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/tweetbot/tweetbot-for-mac">released a public alpha of Tweetbot for Mac</a>, the newest verison of the company’s popular iOS Twitter client. Within a few hours, the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/11/tweetbot-mac">usual</a> <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/07/tweetbot-for-mac-public-alpha/">suspects</a> issued the <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/11/tweetbot-for-mac-alpha">usual</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-for-mac-public-alpha-review/">plaudits</a>. I have been anxiously awaiting the Mac version of my favorite Twitter app, so I quickly downloaded and fired it up.</p>

<p>Tweetbot for Mac takes most of its visual cues from its iPad counterpart, a fact which, for me, is where the problems start.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The layout is pracitcally identical, with a stack of fat buttons running down the left side of your timeline. Up top are standard OS X traffic light controls and buttons for accessing lists and composing new tweets. Everything, right down to the number of clicks it takes to perform basic actions, feels built for a touchscreen.</p>

<p>Most early reactions I have read compare Tweetbot against Twitter’s withering official Mac app, which hasn’t been updated since June 1st of last year. If you’re switching from an app that hasn’t even had a bug fix, let alone an update that brings it in line with Twitter’s own overhauls, in 408 days and counting, then of course you’re going to notice vast improvements. I’ve been using Twitterrific for Mac, though, which in my opinion is not only one of the best Twitter apps around but one of the best Mac apps period.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/07/tweetbot-v-twitterrific.jpg" title="Tweetbot and Twitterrific Side-by-Side" /></p>
<p><div align="center">Tweetbot (left) and Twitterrific.</div></p>

<p>Over the years I have noticed a theme in my app choices on the Mac. Assuming two apps have similar feature sets and run relatively bug free, I always choose the app that feels most at home in OS X, the app that takes the most advantage of the design elements that Apple provides.</p>

<p>A classic example occurred back when I chose between <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> and <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. It’s a common trope (on forums where these sorts of things are discussed) that Things is the better designed of the two apps for its unique flourishes, that it is the GTD app for creative types and OmniFocus is more for the corporate set. For me, OmniFocus naturally fit into my workflow, in part because it felt at home on my Mac.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I get that some people see plainness when they look at it, but I see the best of what makes a Mac a Mac, laid out in a way that makes it simple for me to quickly and efficiently use it.</p>

<p>Given Tapbots’ track record of elegant apps that take advantage of a given unique interface, I was expecting a Mac app tailored to mouse and keyboard use, hopefully more for the keyboard since I’m happiest when I don’t have to take my hands off of it.</p>

<p>Tweetbot packs an excellent feature set, including their class leading Mute functionality, which makes it simple to turn off users, hashtags and pretty much anything else on Twitter for a set amount of time. I rarely use muting unless a specific topic or event is flooding my stream.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Even then I often don’t feel like taking the time to set up a hashtag mute. I’m quicker to unfollow an annoying user than mute them. So that’s not a selling point <em>for me</em>, but I get why many people are thankful for it.</p>

<p>What I want from a Mac-based Twitter Client is the ability to easily write new tweets, send replies, move through my timeline quickly and open links from my keyboard. As it is right now, Tweetbot for Mac is built on touch gestures, and even those have a limited use. Let’s take a look at some.</p>

<p><strong>Gestures:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Swipe Down: Refresh</li>
  <li>Swipe Right on a Tweet: Conversation View</li>
  <li>Swipe Left on a Tweet: Detail View
    <ul>
      <li>Swipe Down in Detail View: Reveal Conversation View</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Careful swiping once you’re in conversation view. It feels like swiping left should take you back to your timeline, but remember, swiping left pulls you into detail view. If you play with this for a bit, you’ll see that you start diving deep into the same series of tweets trying to swipe your way out of it. Which is fine, I prefer using the keyboard anyway. So let’s look at the keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>⌘1: Go to Timeline</li>
  <li>⌘2: Go to Mentions
    <ul>
      <li>…just click on “Window” in the Menubar to see all of these. Moving on…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>⌘N: New Tweet</li>
  <li>⇧⌘R: Refresh Timeline</li>
  <li>⌘R: Reply to Selected Tweet</li>
  <li>↓: Navigate Down 1 Tweet</li>
  <li>↑: Navigate up 1 Tweet</li>
  <li>→: Go to Detail View of Selected Tweet</li>
  <li>←: Exit Detail View, Back to Timeline (No Function on Timeline)</li>
  <li>⌘↓: Scroll to Bottom</li>
  <li>⌘↑: Scroll to Top</li>
  <li>F: Favorite Tweet</li>
  <li>⌘K: Mark All As Read</li>
</ul>

<p>There aren’t (preset) shortcuts for retweet, rewtweet with comment, enter conversation view or open links. In Twitterrific typing → on a tweet that contains a link will open it in your default browser. I use that feature all day long.</p>

<p>Perhaps the thing that stops me in my tracks more than anything is that the Page Up and Page Down keys do nothing in Tweetbot. I like flying through my timeline one “page” but with Tweetbot the only way to move by more than one tweet a time is with the mouse. Scrolling through the timeline then puts the onus on me to go slowly enough that I’m seeing only new tweets with each scroll without shuttling past any. Instead of hitting one button on my keyboard.</p>

<p>Tweetbot for Mac is alpha software so we should expect that it is still half baked. Many of the niggles I describe here are likely to get fixed, but I think Tapbots is showing us how they think a Mac app should look, feel and function. For now, that’s not in line with how I prefer to use Twitter, or my Mac for that matter.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is Twitterrific<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, a great Mac Twitter client, available today, right now. Hey look, it’s on sale for $4.99. <a href="http://bit.ly/PScFla">Go get it</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I get that this is alhpa software and that the final Mac App Store version may be wildly different from what it we see today, but if others can heap praise on it then I don’t feel too bad picking apart what Tapbots has shared with us.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>If you must know, the “killer feature” that sold me on OmniFocus was the way you create a new task simply by hitting return.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>You’re on thin ice, though, #SDCC.<a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:5">
      <p>Need another reason? Twitterrific is the only app I know of that consolidates mentions and direct messages on your timeline. It’s incredible, but I bring it up as a footnote because I don’t expect any app to ape this functionality (though they should) so I don’t need to hold it up as a Tweetbot deficiency.<a href="#fnref:5" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Greg Sandoval over at CNET put together a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57468798-93/netflixs-lost-year-the-inside-story-of-the-price-hike-train-wreck/">long (if dry) account</a> of Netflix’s major fumbles in 2011. A lot of it is old news, though it does dig deep into how fundamentally different the company is today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a little over a year, four of Netflix’s top managers – McCarthy, Kilgore, Rendich and Ross – were out. Some of them were instrumental in helping take the company public in 2002. They helped lay waste to traditional movie renting, and created one of the most recognizable and respected brands on the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to look at Netflix as the same company anymore.</p>
