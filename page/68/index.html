  <div class="entry-content"><p>Evan Luzi provides a great overview of the costs of digital filmmaking in a
new post, <a href="http://www.theblackandblue.com/2011/08/04/epic-cost/">The Hidden Cost of RED Epic and Digital
Cinema</a>, on The Black
and Blue. His main focus is the on the new(-ish) RED Epic 5K camera and how
its high resolution carries with it a steep increase in production costs. No
matter how affordable the camera becomes (without lenses, the kit <a href="http://www.red.com/store/epic/product/epic-m">retails for
$58,000</a>, a relative steal) the
actual production costs are exponential to that of a lower resolution camera.
As Evan points out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Estimates are showing that, “At 5k 2:1 and REDcode 5:1 (which will likely be
what most features shoot with), a 64GB SSD will be about 12-13 minutes,” <a href="http://reduser.net/forum/showthread.php?52455-More-
SSD-questions&p;=687522&viewfull;=1#post687522">said
Deanan Dasilva from RED</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s about half of what you get at a similar aspect ratio, 4K, Redcode 42
compression ratio with the RED One.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot more shop talk in his article (that’s The Black and Blue’s
charm) about where all the money goes, but it’s later on that Evan hits on the
most interesting aspect of the new format’s effects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the longest time, digital impressed filmmakers because they could shoot
at high qualities at a relatively low cost to film.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inevitable is happening: digital costs are equalizing themselves, offering
little to no advantage over actual film. Meanwhile, the rush to digital has
completely eroded the film marketplace. In the very near future, there may be
<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news
/deluxe-technicolor-begin-orderly-retreat-212459">nowhere to process film anymore</a>, that is if companies are
still producing the stuff. Film’s death knell never rang so loud as it does
today.</p>

<p>As curmudgeons no doubt whined about sound and color in cinema, I feel we
rushed into digital. In New York City, it’s almost impossible to catch a new
movie on 35mm film anymore<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I have a particular love for celluloid film.
It’s an organism, beholden to nature and the elements just like the rest of
us. This, of course, is its downfall. Digitally projected movies are crisp and
clean, lacking the dust, scratches, cigarette burns and other blemishes of its
forbear, but it’s not nostalgia for film’s ugly side that makes me love it.</p>

<p>Digital motion pictures are more lifeless than film images. They hang there
over the audience, a corpse-like patina covering the screen just above the
action. Digital’s binary nature allows it to be exactly what it is told to be
(either a one or a zero); film, on the other hand, manages to have a mind of
its own.</p>

<p>Digital production tools are often considered to be superior to film for their
cost and their convenience, but they are becoming more and more like film as
time goes on. I for one, don’t find digitally captured images to be superior,
or equivalent, to their film counterparts. There is a certain beauty that
digital imagery brings to the table, but as a format all its own, not as a
replacement for film. Too bad, then, that we now live in a world where it’s
the only game in town, and its convenience and cost are now on par with that
spurned hog known as celluloid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The A.V. Club published an interesting article yesterday by writer Sam Adams
called <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-convenience-trap-what-
the-changes-at-netflix-r,59829/">“The convenience trap: What the changes at Netflix reveal about an
insidious trend”</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The crux of it is that viewers should
not be worried for their wallets in the face of Netflix’s 60% price hike, but
instead should be worried of a world where Netflix streaming is considered the
gold standard of viewing selection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In essence, Netflix is gambling that its customers are less concerned about
watching the right movie than watching right now. What if it’s right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, Adams argues that we are headed for a future in which the great
cinema gets cast aside as technology iterates. The landscape is such, he
argues, that if viewers don’t have to seek out good work anymore, then there
will be no place for it. The convenience of a bottomless, instant pool of
choices ultimately tempers our outlook on the work. If we can watch a film
anytime, why watch it now?</p>

<p>commentary](http://www.subtraction.com/2011/08/03/the-convenience-trap).</p>

<p>It’s an interesting argument about technology, but Adams muddles the whole
thing up by laying the blame at Netflix’s (and really its users’) feet.
netflix is decidedly the biggest gorilla in the room, but there are
alternatives to it, both for discs and for streaming. Adams ruefully points
out the holes in Netflix’s streaming library (“Derek Jarman’s <em>Edward II</em> is
there, but not his masterful <em>The Last Of England</em>.”) but fails to mention
that filling them remains antithetical to his argument. The good stuff isn’t
on there, but if it were viewers still wouldn’t watch it.</p>

<p>When I read and reread this article, I can’t help but ask “What’s the
problem?” and find that I can’t quite figure one out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re not inclined to put forth the effort to get yourself in close
proximity to a given artwork, will you be willing to expend the mental energy
necessary to understand it? How much more likely are you to bail on, say,
Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <em>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</em>,
when with a few clicks of your remote you can be watching a favorite episode
of <em>Friday Night Lights</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you wonder why people find film writers often intolerable, this is why.
First off, it’s offensive to compare these two works. He has chosen a dense,
cerebral Thai masterwork and butt it up against an American television drama
about football. Again, what’s the problem? While it’s true that most would
pick the latter, ten years ago Weerasethakul’s film probably wouldn’t have
made it into American homes at all. If anything he’s proving the boon that
Netflix can be for world cinema.</p>

<p>The trouble is thinking that Netflix is the only option for both viewing and
discovery. Before Netflix, how did we decide what to watch? Maybe it was the
clerks’ picks at the video store, maybe it was word of mouth from a friend. At
one time it was based solely on what was playing at the local theater. There
is a lot of room for improvement for how we discover cinema
(<a href="http://www.jinni.com/">Jinni</a> is one somewhat maddening attempt at fixing
this) but it’s foolhardy to blame streaming technology for our own viewing
deficiencies.</p>

<p>Films are available out in the ether on a variety of above (and below) board
services. The trick is in deciding that they should be watched. That’s not
something Netflix can control, nor should we be so naïve as to think any one
company <em>should</em> be in control of that. Adams is right in the sense that we
should seek out great art. With that in mind, there’s no reason that we can’t
use our computers or our television sets to find great cinema; we just need to
look places besides Netflix to promote competition and innovation in this
space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joe Cornish’s <em>Attack the Block</em> may be the most fun film of 2011 thus far, and perhaps one of the most astonishing directorial debuts of the year. It is a romp that lightly parodies its source material while holding it’s own in the pantheon of genre cinema. Better, it transcends genre enough to become something increasingly rare at the multiplexes: a damned good little movie that actually makes you think.</p>

<p>The film follows a gang of troubled youths, led by the aptly named Moses (John Boyega), as their housing project is overrun by creepy creatures from outer space. The film posits that an alien invasion might not be as dramatic as films generally make it out to be. Perhaps instead of the usual “Take us to your leader” rhetoric, the aliens would land in an area where no one cares if it’s inhabitants live or die and let nature take it’s course.</p>

<p>I can’t help but bring up J.J. Abrams’s <em>Super 8</em> when discussing <em>Attack the Block</em>. Where one is dipped in saccharine, the other is doused in acid. Both films follow a similar structure: kids discover destructive extra- terrestrial(s) and must bring a reckoning once they realize the adults of the world are unable to see the truth, all while learning valuable lessons about themselves. The difference, besides the gore and mortality ever-present in Cornish’s take but rid of Abrams’s, is in the revelations of the main characters. Moses’s sense of self in the <em>Attack’s</em> pivotal (and beautiful) final moments comes from inside; he is one with himself. <em>Super 8’s</em> Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) on the other hand realizes that he must firm up the relationships around him in order to live happily. The irony is that the film with the stronger message (and equally less patronizing) is the one that parents will likely keep their kids away from.</p>

<p>Finally, the “low-budget” creature effects in the film are absolutely brilliant. They are reminiscent of the eerie creature in Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <em>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</em>, but with significantly more bite. Just as in that Thai, it is the cocksure hand of the filmmaker that makes the otherwise cheesy costume come across as harrowing, terrifying, mesmerizing. Anyone suffering from CG fatigue will certainly enjoy these fuzzy black monsters.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I can’t think of a better way to spend money this weekend than on a ticket to see <em>Attack the Block</em>. At worst you’ll get a laugh out of Nick Frost’s stoner comic relief. I’ll join the ranks and tell you to check out the film about a South London gang that fights aliens, but really there’s a lot more to this film than that. I can’t wait to see where Cornish takes us next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just barely made it to a screening of <em>Bellflower</em> at SXSW this past year,
but I was <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/03/15/sxsw-11
-review-bellflower/">instantly taken</a> by its apocalyptic charm. For a film that is about the
bitterness of love lost, it has a surprising amount of life, a certain demonic
spring in its step. That melange of emotions comes from the film’s writer,
director and star, Evan Glodell.</p>

<p>Woodrow, the character Evan plays in his film, and best pal Aiden (Tyler
Dawson) are tinkerers, forever trying to build bigger and more explosive
contraptions. The film itself is something of a handmade experiment. Evan and
his team built their cameras by putting vintage bellows systems together with
cutting edge digital sensors, giving <em>Bellflower</em> a look reminiscient of,
well, nothing else I’ve seen. It is at once vintage yet modern, aged yet
entirely new.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Evan recently about <em>Bellflower</em> and the
work that inspires him. Give a listen and check out the film when it hits
theaters this summer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ken Auletta in this week’s <em>New Yorker</em> profile of Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the meantime, Facebook is quietly trying to integrate itself into every form of media. Chris Cox, the engineer who oversees Facebook’s product development, says of television, “You go home at night and there’s nine hundred and ninety-nine channels&#8230; . The real problem in that world is: What should I watch?” Perhaps you could read TV Guide, perhaps you could type “best Thursday sitcom” into Google, or perhaps you could scan some newspaper reviews. Cox wants you to be able to see on your screen what your Facebook friends are watching. “You should turn it on and it should say, ‘Fourteen of your friends liked “Entourage” this week. Click to watch.’ ” The idea is for Facebook to “tune in to everything around you,” he said. “We call it social design.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add this to a growing pile of evidence while you consider my previous article on <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/06/30/what-a-netflix-facebook-alliance-means-for-filmmakers/">What a Netflix &amp; Facebook Alliance Means for Filmmakers</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Porn. That’s the best way to describe Michael Bay’s <em>Transformers: Dark of the
Moon</em>. And all kinds of porn too (well, not gay porn) including the kind of
the woman-terrorized-by-phalluses-slash-tentacles variety. The story is
ludicrous, the main character’s mate is way too good looking for him and all
you want to do is fast forward to the good parts, which involve everyone
shutting up and getting some action. That’s not to say it’s all bad. Who
watches porn for the story anyway?</p>

<p>To be honest, this third <em>Transformers</em> installment is probably the best in
the franchise. The concept behind these films has become completely unhinged,
lending itself even further to excess, stupidity, stereotypes, explosions and,
well, fun. For the longest time Michael Bay has had a chip on his shoulder
about the quality of his films. Everyone says they’re terrible, but he says
they’re great, usually citing box office numbers as proof of his worth. This
go round, it seems he has finally accepted who he is: a maker of fantastically
terrible films.</p>

<p>The plot, crafted by writer Ehren Kruger, actually has a lot of potential. The
Autobots (good guys!), now government shills, are blindsided when a former
friend turns out to be working with the Decepticons (bad guys!) in an effort
to restore Cybertron, their devastated robot planet, to its former glory. The
Americans, for their part, hid the fact that the Apollo space missions were
designed to learn more about a crashed Autobot ship that had been stranded on
the moon since the early 1960s. Then Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) gets annoyed
about something, his girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) pouts while
narrowly avoiding upskirt mishaps and Patrick Dempsey flips his hair douchily
as Sam’s faux-cum-actual enemy, Dylan Gould, accountant to the stars. It’s a
mess, but it’s a mess that manages to thrill.</p>

<p>I’m hearing this idle chatter that the action is too frenetic to keep track
of, but I think the creative team finally got the speed and motion of these
robot aliens right. There is a <em>lot</em> of movement, sure, but <em>Transformers:
Revenge of the Fallen</em> was hardly watchable as there was too much shit
flitting and spiraling across the screen. That still happens, but the movement
is more balletic, more pleasing somehow. Say what you will about Bay’s
irresponsibilities as a filmmaker, the effects team here is top notch. It is
clear that they take the character design seriously, even if nothing else in
the film is worth a brain cell.</p>

<p>Michael Bay’s messages are always so boring. The main message that runs
through the bulk of his work is quite simple: America is great, the military
may be fallible but its soldiers aren’t and fuck all you haters. There is a
certain nobility to his unwavering (to the point of stupid) patriotism, but
here, in an intergalactic fight to the death, it doesn’t make much sense. The
Autobots claim to love humanity, but that manifests itself into fighting wars
for America, wars that shouldn’t exist given that only the U.S. has friggin’
robots on its side.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <em>Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</em>, to pick one, is a
far more nuanced film than this one that actually confronts the issue of
military disarmament in the face of technological superiority. The best
Optimus Prime and his buddies could think up to help humanity was to blow up
illegal nuclear facilities in the Middle East? Advanced civilization my ass.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should give Mr. Kruger more credit for crafting this story. It’s
entirely possible that there once was a message to the story that got muddied
up by all the explosions and underwear modeling. There are obvious allusions
to America’s post-9/11 place in the world (e.g. “Chicago is Ground Zero”, a
keffiyeh-wearing Megatron wandering the desert, the severing of an office
building as soldiers and workers slide to their deaths) but the story never
congeals into anything meaningful. Bay is a director for whom emotional and
thematic development is a nuisance. He needs to move characters from one
firefight to the next, and if that means in one scene Carly is Sam’s greatest
defender but in the next she is bitterly pissed, that’s okay as long as she
wanders into impending doom.</p>

<p>Michael Bay never really stopped directing music videos. His budgets are
bigger and his runtimes may be longer, but he is still a maker of snacks, not
meals. As a collection of scenes, <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em> delivers as
much action as anyone could expect. It’s far more entertaining, adrenaline-
wise, than the other blockbusters that have come out this summer. I’d be
remiss if I didn’t mention <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, which is a superhero action
film that tries to imbue a very real message on its viewers. I liked that film
very much, for its performances, its story and the conversations it incited
after I left the theater. However, I don’t think I actually had as much fun
watching it as I did Bay’s latest. On some level I feel guilty for smiling my
way through the mess that is the third (the third!) Transformers film. It is
pointless, a bit racist, a lot sexist and absolutely horrible for your teeth.
It’s everything a boy could want at the movies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings announced that he would be <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/27/reed-
hastings-facebook-netflix">joining
Facebook’s board of directors</a>. The overlap between the two tech companies has
some implications that could be good for consumers and filmmakers alike.
Hastings has earned a reputation as one of the most forward-thinking
executives in business (see: the name “Netflix”). I think if we consider where
Netflix wants to be in five years, this alliance could have far-reaching
effects for the film industry.</p>

<h2 id="network-not-utility">Network, Not Utility</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009343">A 2009 study</a> told us what we
already knew. As published in Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If marketing mavens want to reach younger moviegoers when promoting their
films, they need to embrace social networks or risk being ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, young audiences go online to learn about what they should watch. A
friend’s recommendation holds far more weight than that of a film critic. The
trouble is that most studios believe that social networks are a great
marketing outlet. I think Netflix realizes that social networks <em>are the
network</em>. They are the place where people go not only to discover new tastes
but to experience them. Netflix doesn’t want to play the studios’ game
anymore. It wants to forge ahead and start something that’s never been tried
before.</p>

<p>The first clue as to where Netflix sees the future is their <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-outbids-hbo-david-
fincher-167882">acquisition of
the David Fincher series <em>House of
Cards</em></a>. The company bought the 26 episode first season for $100
million, outbidding HBO. This marks their first foray into original content
and perhaps paves the way for them to break free of the television networks
and studios that license content to them. Netflix doesn’t want to be a utility
like water or power; it wants to be a network. And if they start acting like
another network, then there will be more opportunities for filmmakers to
create compelling content to reach a wide audience.</p>

<h2 id="billion-eyes">1.4 Billion Eyes</h2>

<p>Current estimates have Facebook at about 700 million active users worldwide.
Everyone uses the site differently, but we know they all <em>use</em> it. In the U.S.
there is an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/facebook-users-members-us-
growth-drops-may-2011_n_875810.html">estimated 150 million
users</a> while Nielsen clocks households with
televisions at <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/nielsen-
estimates-number-of-u-s-television-homes-to-be-114-7-million/">around 115
million</a>. Perhaps a
difference of 35 million doesn’t seem that daunting, but consider this:
Facebook is everywhere (at work, on your mobile, on your tablet, on your home
PC, etc.) whereas your television is only at your house. The potential is
monumental.</p>

<p>Netflix has roughly <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/netflix">23 million users in the U.S. and
Canada</a>, a healthy number
especially for a pay service that requires users to buy devices in order to
take full advantage of it. If one third of their user base tuned in to
original content, like the forthcoming <em>House of Cards</em>, it would be one of
the most popular shows on cable TV. That may seem unlikely, but don’t forget
there was a time when no one thought HBO would be able to garner as big an
audience as it has. The accepted wisdom was that people wouldn’t want to
subscribe just to watch a single show, but once <em>The Sopranos</em> hit the
audience came in droves. Netflix wants to be the next HBO.</p>

<p>Look at how many opportunities have opened up over the last few years as pay
and included cable channels have beefed up their schedules. Quality work is
getting made on a scale that was once unimaginable in the world of network
television. Documentaries are more popular than ever. Low budget sitcoms like
<em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> and <em>The League</em> are no longer a pipe
dream. Indie films are getting snatched up by emerging channels that need
content to fill their airwaves. If Netflix starts acting like a network that
barrier to entry could be eradicated even further. We’ve already seen them
exhume films that would have otherwise been forgotten, small indie gems (or
total crap, sometimes) that wouldn’t be worth financing a DVD re-release can
now be streamed to new audiences. The internet has always been a boon to
filmmakers in this way, but Netflix and Facebook are where people are. It’s a
willing audience that filmmakers should be looking to hook.</p>

<h2 id="social-curation">Social Curation</h2>

<p>Today, our social streams and our video entertainment are, for the most, part,
separate. Right now I can plop in front of my couch and flip on my Boxee Box
and see what my friends are watching or have watched recently through shared
links on Twitter and Facebook. It’s certainly a fun way to discover new
content, but it’s not very intuitive. For one, the Boxee Box can only pick up
video from certain sites (namely YouTube and Vimeo). Once I watch something a
friend shared on Facebook, I can’t actually do much of anything from there.
It’s not really “social” at all. The friend may as well have mailed me a list
of things to watch, and in turn all I can do is hit a “Like” or “Share” button
so someone can watch it again later.</p>

<p>There are many services that try to bring social to the media experience
(<a href="http://gomiso.com/">Miso</a>, <a href="http://getglue.com/">GetGlue</a> and
<a href="http://www.squrl.com/">Squrl</a> come to mind, as do <a href="http://www.whatisbdlive.com/">BD-
Live</a> Blu-ray discs) but they all suffer from
this same short-coming: the experience itself isn’t social. The reason that no
one has become a power player in this space is because it’s extremely
difficult. Unlike location sharing apps like FourSquare, sharing the title of
what you are watching most likely won’t spark an immediate reaction. It’s
generally not relevant information <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>If Netflix and Facebook were deeply integrated with one another, one could set
up group-watching sessions through Facebook and chat alongside the film. This
is something that happens now with hashtags on Twitter, but it’s clunky at
best. Users start a film at the same time then type inanities like “15:42 OMG
this is the best movie ever! #Ghostbusters2Tweet” flooding their feed with the
experience. What if you could all watch the movie through Netflix while
chatting with timestamps in a dedicated Facebook app? Better, you wouldn’t
even need to be watching the film at the same time as one another. If the data
could get logged alongside the film’s runtime, you could join in with notes a
friend left earlier that day, or last week, or last year. Not only would your
friends and contacts be curating the discovery process, they’d be curating the
actual experience.</p>

<h2 id="online-microcinema">Online Microcinema</h2>

<p>The old indie paradigm is dead. Play at fests, get picked up, do a theatrical
tour then on to DVD is a plan from the past. It’s not that it doesn’t still
happen, it’s that something better has been happening recently. For one, the
growth of regional cinema, i.e. films made for and about a certain place, has
helped foster whole communities of filmmakers that weren’t heard before. The
other thing that has cropped up recently is the microcinema, small theaters
that play niche films to audiences that otherwise wouldn’t have access to
them.</p>

<p>Here in New York, a great example is <a href="http://reruntheater.com/index.php">ReRun
Theater</a>, a 60 seat screening room that
plays films from the festival circuit that, for one reason or another,
<del>never landed a distribution deal</del><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> have generally gone unseen by
a wide audience. Part of the success of ReRun is that these films now get a
write up in most major New York publications, which then opens up the
conversation about their quality and relevance to a huge audience. They are
now part of the conversation on a large scale, even if only 200 people come to
the film in the course of a week.</p>

<p>Twitter](https://twitter.com/reruntheater/status/86552403444383744) that they
do in fact work with distributors. I have adjusted the wording to reflect
that.</p>

<p>The mentality of the microcinema, curated content for and by tastemakers, is
where I see online video headed. We want to see what people are talking about,
but we also want to join the conversation. Films need an audience, and the
audiences have all moved online. It seems only natural that filmmakers would
too. Someone just needs to offer a compelling community for both makers and
audience members. I think Netflix and Facebook are poised to do just that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Evan Luzi:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re new to the film industry, it can be confusing to hear someone call for a few “pancakes” well past breakfast time. And what purpose could a box of apples serve those trying to make a movie?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The origin of the term “apple box” is murky, but its modern incarnation is used to describe a standard size wooden box on film sets. They’re a common piece of grip equipment and are used for a wide variety of purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the attention to detail over at <a href="http://www.theblackandblue.com">The Black and Blue</a>. Now could you stand on a half-apple and Hollywood it for me? Thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night’s <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em> sign off, just like the original
<em>Law &amp; Order’s</em> last year, was an understated end to the always understated
show. It is the nature of the procedural to refrain from entering too deeply
into the lives of its recurring characters. No series has exemplified this
more than the various incarnations of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. The show is built for
syndication, which is why it has found a home on a number of channels
seemingly around the clock. Save for age, the first episode is
indistinguishable from the last.</p>

<p>So the series finale wasn’t notable as an ending. Instead, the show’s writers
brought in an odd plot not ripped from the headlines but ripped from the
silver screen. Well, both, technically. The case involved the murder of two
twins who were suing the CEO of a multi-million dollar social networking site
called “Kismate”. Though the episode could seemingly based on the much
publicised rose of Facebook and the ongoing disputes between CEO Mark
Zuckerberg and twins Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss, it’s lifted not from real
life but from the film <em>The Social Network</em>.</p>

<p>Lifting a plot from a film based on a book based on a true event wouldn’t be
all that interesting if it weren’t for how closely linked the film and the
episode were. In particular, the character Rex Tamlyn, played by James Van Der
Beek, is completely lifted off of Justin Timberlake’s Sean Parker in the film.
There is even a moment in which the detectives interview Tamlyn in a club that
looks identical to the one used in the blaring, now iconic scene from <em>The
Social Network</em>. I can’t tell if this is high art or high bullshit.</p>

<p>The episode is admittedly an homage to Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher’s film,
but it begs the question, “Why?” Not only was the plot only ho-hum for this
last episode ever, the cues going back to the film, save for the club scene,
were scant and obvious. The showrunners weren’t taking the foundation of what
we know about Zuckerberg’s exploits from the film and running with it. Instead
they were taking familiar territory and using it to garner a few extra
eyeballs.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <em>Law &amp; Order: CI</em> performed something of a televised coup last
week when the episode revolved around a “Spder-Man: Turn Off the Dark”-like
Broadway show in which a cast member was murdered. That, at least, was ripped
from the headlines and brought some interesting subtext into a highly
publicized event. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the episode “said”
anything, but it certainly was a fun watch and about an event, a point in
history. The finale? Not so much.</p>

<p>Still, whoever was able to convince the network they could shoot the exact
same club scene from an Oscar-winning film for an episode of a cable
television procedural deserves an award all his/her own. Looks like it was a
blast to recreate the thing.</p>
