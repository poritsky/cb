  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I detest the idea of lists, I thought I would mention “10” films that
convey an amazing articulation of contemporary culture (and they just happen
to be a some that I find as my favorites of this year).</p>

<p>_ _</p>

<p><em>Birdsong</em> (Albert Serra)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Birdsong1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The limits of plot are less a concern than the grace of an event’s miraculous
and personal unfolding for an individual. While the film conveys the infamous
birth of a religious figure in a manner that is rooted in secular mortality,
the film focuses on the personal contemplation and expressionistic moments
inspired by the meaning of the event rather than expository dialog about
religious convictions. Amazingly brave in its contemplative execution, Serra
continues to allude to things beyond the nature of cinema’s plastics and
today’s climate of physicality, technology and the literal.</p>

<p><em>Fearne and…Peaches Geldof</em> (Iain Thompson)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Fearne1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The exuberant and excessive brit-pop culture anthropologist Fearne Cotton
interviews the walking symbol of pseudo-modernist globalization: Peaches
Geldof. While dismissed as another tabloid celebrity, Peaches is fascinating
for the very fact that she is the end result of an over-saturated culture of
mediated capitalism, and this “investigative” documentary defines a strange
paradox behind the vapid meaning of today’s pop-psych justified Global-
capitalist-culture. Like it, or hate it, this is the fascinating actualization
of Godard’s chapter entitled “Dialogue with a Consumer Product” in <em>Masculine
Feminine</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Girlfriend Experience</em> (Steven Soderbergh)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/the_girlfriend_experience1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Speaking of Godard, Soderbergh perfects the mediated analogy of prostitution
in the modern commodification of women through his study of Sasha Grey. While
the film situates this classic genre within the American bail-out crisis and,
as such, does adhere to a cold execution of facts, Soderbergh does not derail
enough to miss the true emotional pain in the mediation and sale of women.
Though his choices may appear simple, they are bold, and his genius comes
through in his ability to convey an articulate analysis immediately!</p>

<p><em>Julia</em> (Erick Zonca)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/julia1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Zonca’s very quiet and confident character study of an American woman on the
verge of drug-craved financial crisis overcomes the somewhat conventional
narrative approach. The strengths of this film is in Zonca’s ability to draft
a such a strong and weighty character through Tilda Swinton in a time when
character goes overlooked in the seemingly popular didactic plot-driven
approach of contemporary political cinema.</p>

<p>_Martyrs _(Pascal Laugier)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/martyrs1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While Laugier’s  film appropriates horror conventions in a tale of secret
sadistic torture, it does so to provide for a strong critique of voyeurism in
the vein of Haneke’s <em>Funny Games</em>. Laugier’s film depicts a complicated
emotional analysis of the victimization in torture for exploratory and
vicarious spectatorship that implicitly deconstructs the decade’s cinematic
obsession with flesh-horrors such as Roth’s <em>Hostel</em> or Wan’s <em>Saw</em> series. In
the end, Laguier’s point verges on satiric ambiguity as the responsibility of
viewership results in appropriate self-disgust that should follow this trend.</p>

<p>nbc.com/yoteach  / <em>Funny People</em> (Judd Apatow)</p>

<p>While not necessarily a film, the NBC website gave room for the <em>Funny People</em>
viral campaign that rose above simple advertising.  A fascinating and
illuminating commentary about television’s mediation and appropriations of
cultural stereotypes, the YoTeach site holds clips from a fictitious NBC show
that address issues such as teen pregnancy and internet stalkers. The strength
of the commentary resides in a biting satire that questions television’s
oversimplification and commodification of real American issues. The false
solutions found in the false sitcom clips address the limits of the media’s
antiquated means of conversation.</p>

<p>_Pontypool _(Bruce McDonald)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/Pontypool1.jpg"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/Pontypool1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Always the popular genre, the zombie film is used as a means of understanding
the elusive horrors of today’s loss of meaning in the use of English language.
The confusing concept is amazingly handled by McDonald’s ability to navigate
through abstract concepts in the appropriate and accessible moment-to-moment
zombie trap. The strength of the film lies in the imperceptible way terror
hints its way into our lives before we know with what we are dealing –the real
scare effect that recalls the initial moment of cinematic zombies, before they
loss their scare-factor.</p>

<p><em>Sauna</em> (Antti-Jussi Annila)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Sauna.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Annila’s film depicts the imperceptible horrors associated with intangible
powers behind religious convictions. While the film’s depiction of 16th
Century Occidental landscape can be distancing, Annila’s able to amazingly
manifest the horrors behind the question of another’s belief system overcoming
your own facilities and rationale behind your own convictions. In what feels
like an Ingmar Bergman horror, <em>Sauna</em> hauntingly reverberates the horrifying
questions of a higher intelligence’s wrath through something as simple as an
accidental murder in a border-town.</p>

<p><em>Two Legged Horse</em> (Samira Mahkmalbaf)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/two-legged-
horse.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The daughter of Iranian cinema master Mohsen Mahkmalbaf, Samira takes her
place as his successor with this complex portrait of victimization. A young
man plays “horse” to a boy whom is unable to use his legs, and becomes a
poetic metaphor for mistreatment by those whom take advantage of their
positions of power. The disabled young boy mistreats his “horse” and enacts
some of the most disturbing abuses committed to film this year. Strongly
calling for real-life action beyond the confines of this sensitive, yet
intensely scarring film, Samira has places herself among the most important
political filmmakers working today.</p>

<p><em>Whatever Works</em> (Woody Allen)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/whatever-works.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The grand comedic artist returns to American to provide a simple update of the
neurosis of contemporary Americana. While Larry David is prominent, he is
merely the vehicle through which Allen is able to deconstruct the apprehension
Americans have about finding comfort in the overcomplication of sex roles. The
real resolve is in trusting happiness can exist without hope, and that love’s
overly complicated depiction is simply to validate itself when the humanity
remains within its clichés.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>After a great deal of discussion on our <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/28/bests-of-the-decade-candlercast-part-iv-directors/">bests of the decade
podcast</a>, we are
finally ready to let you in on our director of the decade: Steven Soderbergh. He won an Oscar, made a slew of
successful films while keeping his arthouse street cred, legitimized the RED Camera, and pretty much just
blew everyone out of the water in the last ten years. But don’t take my word for it, Sunrise provided a great
writeup of the man and his decade. Let us know in the comments if you think we chose wisely (or not).</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/5989656.jpg" title="Steven Soderbergh" /></p>

<p>The way in which Steven Soderbergh starts off this decade is with such veracity and force with <em>Traffic</em> and
<em>Erin Brochovich</em>, it is a wonder that he not only maintains such consistency towards the end, but implements
a fascinating success that is important not only for him as an artist, but for us as an audience.</p>

<p>Leaving the nineties as a “Sundance” poster boy with questionable box office draw, he made a sudden turn with
1998’s <em>Out of Sight</em> and opened the decade with winning one of two Best Director nominations, to which only
Michael Curtiz’s 1938 double nomination loss comes close in comparison. While Curtiz was just as much of a
workhorse, what makes Soderbergh’s nomination so amazing is the metaphoric weight of self-challenge it
represents. This challenge, as it were, is extended beyond his own growth as an artist into the ever-growing
challenges he places upon his peers and audience.</p>

<p>With the thunderous advance in technology, the accessibility of media has allowed for more consumption
without the challenge directed toward its make and read. While cinematic history notes figures such as
Jan-Luc Godard or Martin Scorsese pushing past previous cinematic limitations, not just through language and
syntax, but from it’s preparation right through to reception, Soderbergh has been able to successfully propel
American cinema into the digital/non-linear realm with the same vigor, enthusiasm and progressive attitude
toward the possibilities. And while the Best Director Oscar is awarded one evening, his going right back to
work on <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> the following day suggests an allegiance to advancement rather than revelry in the
successes of the day.</p>

<p>Securing his <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> strategy successfully enacted theories of cinema’s past: simultaneous stature
as a studio director and the experimental freedom suggested by previous studio/indie predecessor models
Scorsese and Coppola. This balance of work has opened up the opportunity not to only deliver a meaningful
punch through his experimental works (such as <em>Full Frontal</em> or <em>Bubble</em>) but such depth trickles back into
his studio works and blurs the line between a “wide audience” film and “art-house” fare, so that <em>The Good
German</em> or <em>Ocean’s Thirteen</em> is both and neither. What is so amazing about the ability of his films to stand
out beyond these “terms” is that he has allowed modern American box-office cinema to finally stand on it’s
legs as “art,” whether it’s opening to a substantial amount of money on opening day or not. What’s more, is
that he expects you to interact and participate with any of his films in the same way, so that a political
message is intrinsic to <em>Che</em> just as much as it is to the <em>The Informant!</em>.</p>

<p>Besides the audience participation challenge, implicit within the work is a drive to push narrative work into
a dialog with other dominant American filmmakers. My favorite film of the decade, <em>Ocean’s Twelve</em>, implies a
conversation with Tarantino, Shyamalan and amazingly Garry Marshall, in a manner less like homage and more
like respectful challenge to “do one better.” This suggests a cinematic challenge among the masters that
results in rapid artistic progression, bringing the real collaborative feel of his beloved sixties cinema!
Such command he has to work with the quiet humble that allows any of his films to work without any such
notice of these workings. That was the craftsman Curtiz would appreciate, while the artistic and progressive
flourishes are what Scorsese can pat him on the back for.</p>

<p>These feats have allowed Soderbergh to confirm the man seen in his <em>sex, lies and videotape</em> Sundance win of
1989, a means of continual development that secures him as the new American cinema master in the likes of all
the greats that persevere to push an art form ahead. Please check the updates for his current Aussie stage
play <em>Tot-Mom</em>, or the future 3D “Cleopatra” musical- opus, that I’m sure will continue to evolve the media
landscape in the manner appropriate for the “digital/non-linear” age.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/daniel-day-lewis-
nine.jpg" alt="" />Fetishism is the first word that comes to mind when considering Rob
Marshall’s newest musical film, <em>Nine</em>. Take your pick of which element is
fetishized: Europe, the 1960s, cinema, Penélope Cruz, etc. This isn’t
necessarily a bad thing. It’s actually quite an accurate read of how we now
view the work of Federico Fellini and his peers. The filmmaker, on whose <em>8 ½</em>
the 1982 musical, and by proxy this film, is based is known not only for his
mastery of film language but for his keen eye for style. Of course, Fellini’s
film was not a musical, but a backstage circus in the life of a woebegone
director. Converting it to a stage musical must have been daunting enough, but
bringing it back to the screen is something of a chore.</p>

<p>Daniel Day-Lewis is Guido Contini, the Italian director whose next film is
sold as being his return to his glory days. The problem is that he hasn’t
written it yet, and from the outset we learn he begins shooting in ten days.
He is also a womanizer, haunted by the dream versions of the real women in his
life. Though he is surrounded by men, it is the women who serves as his muses,
for better or worse. Day-Lewis brings not only his uncanny abilities of vocal
interpretation but also an incredible physicality to the Italian auteur.
Gliding across the screen, he feels ten feet tall atop legs made of feathers.
Sure, he’s no Fred Astaire, but if someone asked him to he could probably pull
that off too.</p>

<p>Just as Fellini’s <em>8 ½</em> was a backstage film, this is a backstage musical.
Nearly all of the numbers, in at least some capacity, take place on a
soundstage that exists in the main character’s mind. Well, it’s also the set
of his upcoming film, but really it’s just in his mind. The trouble is that
this gimmick falls flat for a few reasons. First off, the musical numbers do
little to move the story forward, even emotionally. Almost every single song
deals with how much of a failure Guido has become later in life. If you had to
take a shot every time the name Guido was uttered in a song, you’d be dead by
the third reel. These indulgences would be fine if we actually learned
anything useful about the character, but we know just about everything up
front.</p>

<p>On top of that, some of the songs are just complete failures, such as Kate
Hudson’s “Cinema Italiano”. This number, a hippy dippy boogaloo of sorts, is
so boring musically, so conceptually flawed and so out of place in this film,
the only consolation the viewer has is that it was written exclusively for the
film. Meaning theatergoers were spared this insanity. On the other had, the
showstopper of the bunch, Fergie’s “Be Italian”, is catchy enough to get stuck
in your head and choreographed quite nicely for the stage, but fails to wow on
screen. If I were watching the sandy tambourining live, I’d be enthralled, but
it just doesn’t translate to cinema.</p>

<p>The only number that stands out is “I Can’t Make this Movie”, which features
Day-Lewis singing in front of a film screen playing dailies from the film
within a film. He feels hauntingly close to the audience in this instance, as
if he is in the room sharing a moment with us. No doubt this will translate
nicely to Americans’ new HDTVs when this hits Blu Ray. Ironically  Also of
note is Marion Cotillard’s “Take it All”, the only song that feels emotionally
motivated in the whole piece.</p>

<p>Rob Marshall certainly lead the movement towards musical cinema early in the
2000s with <em>Chicago</em>, a film whose success launched a number of Broadway
adaptations. I would have loved to have seen this show on Broadway under Mr.
Marshall’s tutelage, but alas we have the film instead. It’s neither a very
good musical nor a very good movie, but I believe audiences are still yearning
for the return to musical cinema, so they will welcome this addition of
something different.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/questmark.png" alt="" />And
finally, the moment you’ve all been waiting for: the best directors of the
decade according to the candler blog. I’m going to do this a little
differently than our first installments on <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/17/bests-of-the-decade-candlercast-
part-i-notable-events/">Notable
Events</a>, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/12/18

podcast, we tried to sum up the entire decade in 90 minutes. We found it
completely impossible. In fact, the time we spent on directors alone was about
that much. The discussion was good enough that I thought we should share it
here. Instead of telling you who we pick as filmmaker of the decade, we
thought you should listen in and hear for yourself. Okay, maybe we’ll tell you
soon so keep your eyes peeled for a post about our favorite filmmaker of the
decade. In the meantime, sit back, relax and listen in on the musings of a few
cinephiles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/sherlock_holmes_warner_bros_pictures_2.jpg" alt="" />In case
your great aunt’s fruitcake wasn’t stale enough this holiday season (as stale
as fruitcake jokes, perhaps?), head to the theater where you can get an eyeful
of the same-old-same-old in Guy Ritchie’s unbearably boring <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>.
The title character, a literary invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of
the few who is yet to find a modern home on the silver screen as the decade of
franchises comes to a close. Having seen Superman, Spiderman, James Bond and
the Star Trek crew get a bigscreen reboot in the aughts, the next ten years
will be dominated by bottom of the barrel heroes who have had a cultural
(read: box office) impact in other generations. So before you line up in 2010
for <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, enter the good inspector Holmes and his devoted
sidekick, Dr. Watson.</p>

<p>Though most fans will agree that the cadaverous Basil Rathbone’s portrayal of
the master sleuth is the truest, it is difficult to deny that Robert Downey
Jr. is more than adequately equipped to carry the torch. He certainly throws
the kitchen sink at the role, though there isn’t much for the gifted thesp to
work with. Penned by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon
Kinberg, this iteration of the Londoner gumshoe has little more than pecks to
hang his hat on. Trained with the precision of a Kung Fu master, Holmes’
newfound brutish strenghth may be the result of deductive reasoning, but he is
a brute nonetheless. Planting blows where words fail him, this Holmes is more
a man of action than any that came before him, which wouldn’t be such a bad
thing if his intellect didn’t feel like such an afterthought.</p>

<p>Then there is Mr. Holmes’ devoted sidekick, Dr. Watson, here portrayed by Jude
Law. The once sodden right arm of our hero has now come into his own, matching
his partner wit for wit, blow for blow. Personally I’m glad to see Watson
being used as more than a crumbcake sounding board, but the trouble is that he
is too close to Holmes in every way. The skepticism and protestations are
still there, but only glancingly. This Watson could go into private practice
and he wouldn’t be missing much.</p>

<p>Instead of calling into question the culture of homophobia that pervades
action cinema (a la <em>Casino Royale</em>), Mr. Ritchie takes the opposite route and
just makes fun of the co-dependent crime solvers. Sure, each has a skirt to
chase after in the film, but when push comes to shove they always choose each
other. I can almost hear the director nudging the ribs of adolescent boys ages
15-55, whispering, “Aren’t they so gay for each other? It’s okay to laugh.”
What’s all the more annoying in all of this is that Holmes’ sexuality, gay
straight or otherwise, is a completely missed opportunity here. Downey is
Downey so he exudes a raw sensuality, but I would have preferred him to
smolder. We are instead slogged through these goofy fits of wink-wink-nudge-
nudge as he chases after an out-of place Rachel McAdams for no reason.</p>

<p>Plot? Psht, don’t worry about plot here. Some jerk is trying to take over
England or the world or something. Had the studio come to me in advance I
could have advised they keep the nefariousness to a minimum and build
character. Perhaps a serial killer would have been nice, but instead we have a
fabulous magician (Mark Strong) leading a pack of fabulous Britons to some
kind of fabulous display of, uh, manhood?</p>

<p>Finally, the visuals. The film is nothing if not stylized. Fashioned after a
newspaper of the day, the colors are awash and some kind of muck sits between
us and the film onscreen. It’s something between <em>Harry Potter _and _300</em>. In
an effort to bring us back to merry old London, Mr. Ritchie and
cinematographer Phillippe Rousselot have filled the screen with digitally
enhanced everything, which is certainly one way to go, though not one I enjoy
sitting through. Sometimes it works, sometimes not so much.</p>

<p>Any time a character is brought to a new generation, there are undoubtedly
changes that will appease new audiences and frustrate traditionalists. That
Sherlock Holmes is now in his second century of pop relevance is no small
feat, and the truth is that this film has sealed the interest of the next
generation of filmgoers and readers. There is no doubt that we will see more
of these films in years to come. One can only hope that whoever makes the next
films will bring the character out of the slump this film represents; there
isn’t anywhere to go but up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Moving forward with our epic podcast of the Bests of the Decade, Sunrise
Tippeconnie and myself attempt to tackle the category of actors. It’s the
twenty-first century, we’ve decided to do away with the term actress and bring
men an women under one big comfy “actor” blanket. Still, we’re not so
progressive that we don’t look on the achievements of men and women
separately. Listen in as we discuss some of the best performances of the last
ten years. From relative unknowns at the outset of the aughts, like Philip
Seymour Hoffman, coming into their own, to aging actors finding new footing in
their golden years, like Dustin Hoffman, it truly has been an exciting decade
for cinema acting. We go through a lot of the top roles, but of course we miss
a few. Check it out for our full thoughts, and click through to see the bests
as picked by your very own candler blog.</p>

content/uploads/2009/12/burnpic6.jpg" alt="" /></a>In 1999, it would have been safe to say
that ER’s George Clooney would never find a way to make the jump from
television star to movie star. After all, he was part of Batman’s ruination.
However, looking back on the last ten years, it’s hard to imagine a Hollywood
without him. By a long-shot, the 2000s have been dominated and defined by
nearly every move the Cloon has made.</p>

<p>After deftly proving his comedic abilities in 2000’s <em>O Brother, Where Art
Thou?</em>, he redefined the homage role as Danny Ocean (once Sinatra’s shoes) in
Ocean’s Eleven and the subsequent sequels. This is probably the role he will
be remembered for: a tough and tested smart aleck whose suit is as sharp as
his wit. The comparisons to Cary Grant are becoming clearer on every outing,
but make no mistake, Mr. Clooney is the embodiment of the modern male. The
more flawed the role, the more he shines. Just look at his recent work as the
title role in <em>Michael Clayton</em>, or as the zany filanderer Harry Pfarrer in
the Coen Brothers’ <em>Burn After Reading</em>. These are roles that are very
specific to masculinity in the aughts, and yet they are somehow timeless. No
other actor has been able to excel at expounding on our moment so
consistently.</p>

<p>And this doesn’t even take into account his offscreen endeavors. It should be
noted that he is growing into one of Hollywood’s most prolific producers,
taking chances on films where others shy away. He makes very smart decisions,
knowing when to throw his celebrity behind a project without looking like an
Oscar chaser, which he already has anyway. Plus, he has found a nice balance
with the media between his philanthropic work and very private personal life.
His colleagues get snapped and lampooned as he slinks on past. However, it is
George Clooney’s phenomenal work this decade that makes him an obvious choice
for Best Actor of the Decade.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-

b091e99c3b047bobby.jpg" alt="" /></a>Cate
Blanchett has pulled off the impossible this decade. She has made herself into
a leading lady while consistently fulfilling the role of character actor.
Almost chameleonlike from film to film, she keeps coming back to surprise us
on nearly every outing. Her most memorable role this decade was as Katherine
Hepburn in Martin Scorsese’s <em>The Aviator</em>, a role that is so simple to get
wrong that many other actresses would never attempt it. What she brought to
the film was both an awareness of our impressionistic expectations and an
originality that built a woman even stronger than the Hepburn in our mind’s
eye.</p>

<p>She also reprised her role as Queen Elizabeth in 2007’s <em>Elizabeth: The Golden
Age</em> and played perhaps the most accurate incarnation of Bob Dylan in Todd
Haynes’ <em>I’m Not There</em>. She was also quite amazingly evil in <em>Indiana Jones
and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em>. It really is her character work that
she is measured by, but that’s not all she has done this decade. Her quirky
deadpan was spot on in <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em>, and the emotional
depth to her role in <em>Babel</em> is unmatched in an actress of her generation.
Truly, imagining the 2000s without her is like imagining it without movies. We
can only hope for great things in the decade to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/avatar-teaser-trailer-4.jpg" title="Avatar Still" /></p>

<p>The use of 3D and advanced imaging/animation techniques allows for not just a technological advance, but serves as a racially problematic metaphor for <em>Avatar’s</em> narrative.</p>

<p>While the use of his technology has a tendency to impress simply in skin textures, and facial gestures, James Cameron’s real success has less to do with animation and compositing techniques and more to do with the over looked 3D technique of weight. The most impressive moment is when protagonist Jake Sully dashes through the forest, chased by a large predator at high speeds, only to find himself jumping over a cliff into a waterfall down below. While this is nothing new in any narrative of a similar type, what is new is the technology’s ability to draft the weight of the character through these different physical environments, and the manipulation of time, we are able to get closer to feeling these moments than in any other film for the simple fact that the camera has been placed, panned, and paced in the appropriate positions to allow for the most tactile understanding of air rushing at one’s body, as well as the initial slowing-down of energy once it submerges within water. While neither the scene nor the tools are necessarily anything new, the careful placement of vantage point is what allows for a very effective use beyond the normal 3D tricks.</p>

<p>While the surface imagery remains effective today, in a couple years we will be stunned by some new partial animation experiment. In that way <em>Avatar</em> is almost repetition of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, and is perhaps a novelty in these areas. Both films share much in the way of technology advancements, animation production schedules and techniques, and excessive use of these abilities in a manner that overwhelms visuals on the screen at the expense of a scene’s narrative clarity. This animation approach, common for any special-effect heavy fantasy, consistently feels in antithesis to the conventional film production approach, which these films attempt to replicate. In normal film execution, the production team attempts to eliminate elements that are uncontrollable and distracting to the audience, so that the story and narrative of a scene are what is the focus. In such fantasy pictures there is a tendency to neglect this fact and add as much as possible to any given frame to replicate the multifaceted movement and imagery of the real world. The result for me are mixed feelings, as I expect to be able to focus on the scene’s emotional and narrative clarity only to find that this information is in constant conflict with busy environment the animation has rendered possible. Half way through the film, I removed my 3D glasses, and actually found the film to be more relaxing. I was able to focus on performance and story with much more focus.</p>

<p>Beyond the immediate response to the technology, Cameron’s attempt to comment on the experience of viewing becomes a narrative subtext. Jake is able to maneuver among creatures alien to his own body via the “avatar” body of the title, which allows him to integrate well into this foreign society so much that they accept him as their own. As the narrative progresses, he falls in love with one of this society which initiates the conflict: even though his emotional connection exists beyond his avatar body, the recognition of it will pull his relationships apart. What Jake learns is that this society is threatened by a human military-corporation (via a complete homage to Cameron’s own <em>Aliens</em> which includes Sigourney Weaver) that wishes to destroy their home to obtain natural resources. Because of his advantage of understanding both sides of the situation, Jake is placed in a position to mediate between sides. The society of which he’s become a part, discovers he is not of their world and they begin to distrust him, which becomes the driving force for the narrative conflicts in the second and third acts. The ability for Jake to view this new world through eyes that are similar to those of the society alien to his own, it suggests a means to comprehend and understand the problems and beliefs of that world. Just as Jake is able to “view” this new world via his avatar body, the audience is also able to “view” this world via their 3D glasses, supporting a strong character-identification.</p>

<p>I have no initial problems with this setup, yet when looking closer to the characterization of this foreign society, I find the metaphoric 3D experience to suddenly imply some racially problematic issues.</p>

<p>At first the narrative seems justified, even when the film serves as a dialog between Cameron and science-fiction cinema past, yet it’s the details that imply a false comprehension of “tribal” societies. Jake first comes into contact with a female inhabitant of this society, Neytiri, who introduces him to her world. While she wears minimal clothing made from natural materials and her dialog and gestures suggest a pre-colonized society, when she returns to her village the concept of a “tribal” society really kicks in with the “whoop and holler” that is reminiscent of “Indians” from American westerns in the 1950s. As Jake learns more of this society, it becomes quite apparent these people are a composite of several minority cultures and pre-colonial societies. As the narrative progresses, we find that Jake is able to learn the ways of these people and eventually serves as a leader to resist against the military-corporation from which he came.</p>

<p>This suggests that those unfamiliar with these cultures can possible understand them if they strap into an “avatar” experience (the “body,” in case of the narrative proper, or the 3D glasses/movie screen, in the case of the audience). The suggestion that this can provide a solution for racial or cultural clashes is overly reductive, and in that way very dangerous. What the film does not take into consideration are the subtleties in a culture that cannot be learned through physical repetition, recall of facts, or the physical replication of body. Speaking only as a Comanche native, there is a mindset and there are cultural nuances of belief that are not translatable via conversation, and cannot be learned by those whohave grown up in a Western thought-process.</p>

<p>To suggest that a dialog can occur if cultures simply put on the other’s shoes and all problems can be resolved, is overlooking real differences in thought process. To really understand the world-view of a non-Western peoples one must be born to those people and learn via ways of believing and understanding that do not quantify, analyze, and deconstruct in the similar ways. For example, traditional American Indian thought often does not place so much emphasis on facts and proof in the way Western thought expects in any day-to-day conversation. Assuming the priorities are the same in a conversation, the Westerner might expect a reason for something while the American Indian would think it unnecessary and irrelevant. Neither point of view is better than the other, but without understanding the difference is a result of a basis of belief that influences complex communication will result in a repetition of a question without a common language or reasoning to respond progressively.</p>

<p>Avatar’s simplistic design does not allow for the rendering of these ideas, and implies that any conflict between cultures is resolvable through discussion, or “induction” into a culture, rather than “birth” into a culture. So a sequence in which Jake Sully proficiently performs tasks of the foreign society is merely an external repetition, and when the society accepts him because he does well, the film makes a fatal error. While Jake can learn about what they believe to be sacred, it does not mean he understands the logic behind why the belief works. The film makes the assumption that all logic works under the same Western thought principles without acknowledging the previously mentioned building blocks of a cultural thought process might be different. In the end Jake is able to prove himself physically able to defend these people against his own military-corporation culture, but that is only as far as he is able to integrate. In reality, Jake Sully would simply be a physical simile in this society, where he would continue to struggle with comprehending what is natural to this culture.</p>

<p>In the end, the fact that the film experience renders 3D a means to understand cultural differences that dominant American culture finds incomprehensible is overly simplistic and damaging to real political negotiations. As the film also suggests, for any colonial oppressed culture, it is a Westerner that will resolve all problems and their pains will be heard. The final sub-textual problem implies that any non-Western culture cannot resolve it’s own problems, and that if it simply waits for a Messiah-like figure from Western culture they will be saved. This insults the integrity of any oppressed culture, as the film clenches its final racist tendencies.</p>

<p>While the nature of voyeurism is well discussed, the result of the film’s conclusion remains quite problematic and should not be taken as a basis for true intercultural analysis. The anticipated response from those of a non- Western culture is “what’s the big deal, it’s a film about aliens,” refuses to acknowledge the nature of the film’s exploration as an influence (conscious or not) on future cultural interactions. Whether we are watching aliens in the theater, we will only interact with other real people beyond it, and whether it’s conscious or not, applying what we have learned from this film is negligent. Further, it is dismissive of the true problems of living through an “avatar” body.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing our discussion of the last decade, Sunrise and I move on to the
best writers ofthe decade. To reiterate, instead of making a definitive list,
we have opted to simply name a person we think is deserving, and discuss their
competition and why they came out on top.</p>

<p>The term “best of the decade” should be defined. We are not just looking for
someone whose creative output was particularly impressive over the last 10
years. Instead, in all the categories we discuss we are looking for someone
who is the best <em>for</em> the decade, someone who was as important to the aughts
as the aughts were to him/her.</p>

<p>The best way to explain is to tell you who our Best Writers of the Decade are
(sorry, Sunrise and I couldn’t agree so there are two), since I absolutely
despise one of the writers we chose. But it’s not about me, it’s about all of
us.</p>

<p>[podcast]http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bests-of-the-
decade-part-ii-writers.mp3[/podcast] <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bests-of-the-

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/haggis.jpg" alt="Paul Haggis" />Paul Haggis does not make movies the
candler blog enjoys, and we are particularly upset about <em>Crash’s</em> pop status.
However, he has had an impressive decade, snagging two Oscars and garnering
tons of attention for projects. Seemingly overnight he became an A-list
scribe, tapping into the most insecure bits of the American subconcious. It
was eerie how close <em>Million Dollar Baby’s</em> release was to the Terri Schiavo
ordeal in the news. He was raised almost to shaman status for bringing one of
the country’s hottest controversies to the screen. He remade James Bond in his
own image this decade, introducing is to a darker, more homoerotic version of
the 1960s über spy. In other words, he successfully moved him into our time.</p>

<p>For all his transgressions, Paul Haggis has that rare talent of making us
prick up our ears and listen to what he has to say. A gifted, if formulaic,
storyteller, it is difficult to ignore the massive impact he has had
throughout the 2000s.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12
/next-tradesecrets2.jpg" alt="Director Tony Gilroy" />Our other choice for best writer is Tony Gilroy, who
has become one of the hottest new directors as we close out the aughts.
Although he is no stranger to penning scripts, he really moved his career in a
new direction this decade when he adapted Robert Ludlum’s <em>The Bourne
Identity</em> to the big screen. Although the first film in the series, directed
by Doug Liman, packed a powerful oomph for a Hollywood unsure of how to make
an action film after 9/11, but it wasn’t until the subsequent sequels, <em>The
Bourne Supremacy</em> and <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em> that we really saw something very
special come together. The two films, but written by Gilroy and directed by
Paul Greengrass, stand out as major progressions in action filmmaking,
essentially creating a new mold for a 21st century action hero.</p>

<p>Also moving into the directing field, Mr. Gilroy got a Best Director
nomination for his first outing at the helm with <em>Michael Clayton</em>, a
brilliant legal thriller starring George Clooney. Though he didn’t win, he
came back very strong this year with <em>Duplicity</em>, a screwball thriller that
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/03/28
/review-duplicity/">really wowed me back when it came out</a>. In both cases, the stories are very simple and classical,
but the context is wholly 21st century, which is where Tony Gilroy’s gift
lies. Not afraid to bring current geopolitical trends into even his most
mundane of projects, his work never crosses the line into preachy (unlike our
other best of the decader). We truly can’t wait to see where he takes things
in the next decade.</p>

<p>In the recording, Sunrise and I mention many other notable writers, but two
that are worth mentioning as our runners up are Jim Jarmusch and Judd Apatow.
Sunrise states that Jarmusch is consistently left out of such discussions,
especially as a writer since he is know mostly for his directing, because his
films aren’t successful enough. The growth of Jarmusch’s narrative structure
over the last 10 years is, perhaps, more notable than any other working
writer. The other person of note is Judd Apatow, who went from being a failed
television producer to the most powerful name in Hollywood in the 2000s.
Keeping his growing gang of followers close to him, one can’t go more than 3
months without seeing a film that his pen touched anymore. Love him or hate
him, his brand of comedy/masculine self-discovery has changed the way an
entire generation of filmgoers look at funny movies.</p>

<p>Recently, frequent candler blog collaborator Sunrise Tippeconnie and I sat
down to record a podcast titled “Bests of the Decade”. Instead of making a
list of the best films of the decade, we thought it would be interesting to
decipher who and what were the most notable people and events in cinema of the
last ten years. We would name a best writer, best actor and actress, and best
director while discussing their competition as a means of justifying our
picks. The plan was to get all of this recorded in one ninety minute show, but
instead we ended up blabbing for over 3 hours. As a courtesy, I have gone to
the trouble of cutting our conversation up into segments, the first of which
covers the most notable developments in cinema during the 2000s. We also go
over our methodology and reasoning for composing a list in this manner.</p>

<p>It was one hell of a decade for filmmaking. We saw the proliferation of high
definition and the legitimization of video as a screening format. The digital
intermediate was introduced, the comic book film re-exploded in Hollywood, the
movement once called Mumblecore found a way to speak to an entirely new
generation of art-house audiences and filmmakers the world over struggled to
translate the nuance of a post-9/11 reality. When you lay out all of the
advances and struggles of the last ten years, you might be amazed at how much
has actually happened and changed while we were all busy at work. Sunrise and
I discuss just a few of these changes in Part I of the Bests of the Decade
Candlercast. Since we know we missed a few, we’d love it if you left some more
in the comments.</p>
