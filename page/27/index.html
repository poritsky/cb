  <div class="entry-content"><p>McKay Coppins, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-making-of-romneys-storm-relief-event">reporting for BuzzFeed</a>, on Mitt Romney’s storm relief event:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As supporters lined up to greet the candidate, a young volunteer in a Romney/Ryan T-shirt stood near the tables, his hands cupped around his mouth, shouting, “You need a donation to get in line!”</p>

  <p>Empty-handed supporters pled for entrance, with one woman asking, “What if we dropped off our donations up front?”</p>

  <p>The volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate. “Just grab something,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Romney camp bought $5,000 of non-perishables at a Wal-Mart, not merely for donating to victims of Sandy, but first for setting up a photo op of the Republican candidate accepting the canned goods as part of the relief.</p>

<p>I wish I could say this is a new low for the GOP’s ticket, but there has been so much slime-ballery this year this latest dip-shit move has some steep competition.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kyle Buchanan <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/theyre-making-another-star-wars-movie-episode-7.html">for Vulture</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, Disney bought Lucasfilm today. Significant! But here is the really, really crazy thing: In the release announcing the acquisition, buried in the sixth paragraph, comes this huge announcement: “[New Lucasfilm president Kathleen] Kennedy will serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, with George Lucas serving as creative consultant. <strong><em>Star Wars Episode 7</em> is targeted for release in 2015, with more feature films expected to continue the Star Wars saga and grow the franchise well into the future.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we all lose our minds I offer this wisdom: why the fuck not?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday morning I walked our dog, <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/104648522332542941803/KrullTheWarriorKing#5151187266605717122">Krull</a>, at around 7am. The air in Austin was crisp, the sky was cloudless. Just before the sun came up, I could see the stars clearly, with Orion hovering just overhead. It was eerie; I knew Hurricane Sandy was about to barrel into the region I called home my entire life, and the weather here couldn’t possibly be any more beautiful.</p>

<p>I miss New York; I miss Philly. This storm has magnified that feeling.</p>

<p>I am starting to understand the people who, every time there is a major weather event, you see on the news refusing to leave their homes. It’s home, after all. I can’t imagine what it must be like to watch your house, your life, ravaged from afar.</p>

<p>New York City, where I lived for six years, most of my adult life, still feels like home, and it is crushing to see the <a href="http://m.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-after-landfall/100396/#img36">photos</a> coming out this morning.</p>

<p>Last summer, when Irene blew into Manhattan, I was lucky enough live on some of the highest ground in the city and have the means to prepare for a disaster. But not everyone is so lucky today. Whole communities need help rebuilding, not just homes but infrastructure. There is no question: hard times are ahead for the east coast.</p>

<p>If you can, please give your time, your attention or your money to whatever cause you feel most comfortable with. Here are two links to get you started:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Red-Cross-Opens-Shelters-Up-and-Down-Eastern-Seaboard">American Red Cross</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nechama.org/index.php/hurricane-sandy">NECHAMA: Jewish Response to Disaster</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My pal Rafi at Heeb also has a <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/storm-und-drang-a-post-sandy-round-up/39464">nice overview</a> of local organizations that need assistance.</p>

<p>However you are weathering this storm, please stay safe and check in on your friends and family. I’m sure they have a story to tell.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Gothamist has <a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/heres_how_to_volunteer_time_money_t.php">posted a comprehensive list</a> of ways to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks again to The New York Film Academy for sponsoring the candler blog this past week.</em></p>

<p>Are filmmakers and photographers breeds apart? Not necessarily. Some notable photographers have made films (Larry Clark, William Eggleston, William Klein, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Man Ray). In the 1990s, celebrity photographer Herb Ritts (Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, and Dalai Lama) won two MTV Video Awards for videos he directed for recording artists Janet Jackson and Chris Isaac, in addition to a large body of work in television advertising.</p>

<p>The New York Film Academy <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu/photography-school/" rel="nofollow">Photography School</a>, offering a one-year program at its New York and Los Angeles campuses and a Master of Fine Arts at its LA film school campus, is a distinct program. The one-year program requires no photography experience, although many students have prior training. They learn basic technical, aesthetic and business skills required of professional photographers. Masters candidates study higher-level methodologies such as photochemical processing, specialized optics, printing processes and advanced digital techniques.</p>

<p>What’s the connection to filmmaking? After the technical aspects of still photography are mastered, some photographers just want their subjects to move. It doesn’t hurt to have trained in the sphere of actors, filmmakers, producers and screenwriters. That’s what happens to students at these NYFA campuses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My thanks to The New York Film Academy for sponsoring the candler blog this week.</em></p>

<p>You might say the person who studies producing for film and television at the undergraduate or graduate school level is possessed of certain audaciousness. What kind of a person envisions running the whole show at that age?</p>

<p>To be a producer is a pinnacle experience, after all. Rarely does the producer become an actor, but many actors migrate to producing. At the New York Film Academy, the Producing Program (housed within the <a href="http://www.nyfa.edu" rel="nofollow">Film School</a>) treats students as producers throughout their program. They start with a book, play, concept or treatment and walk it down the critical path of being produced: the pitch, treatment, script, talent search, budget and schedule, all the way through distribution and marketing.</p>

<p>Producers cannot be wallflowers, so it makes sense that those who choose this program arrive with a good deal of self-confidence. Experience in the industry is not an entrance requirement, but the desire to create breakthrough films and television programs is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tina Brown and Baba Shetty, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/18/a-turn-of-the-page-for-newsweek.html">this morning</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Newsweek will transition to an all-digital format in early 2013. As part of this transition, the last print edition in the United States will be our Dec. 31 issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t read Newsweek, and have found their digital offerings thus far appalling.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> However, this is major news in the media world. I expect this is the first of many similar announcements throughout 2013.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our judgment, we have reached a tipping point at which we can most efficiently and effectively reach our readers in all-digital format. This was not the case just two years ago. It will increasingly be the case in the years ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a brave new world, I suppose.</p>

<p>Still, I give the all-digital Newsweek a year, maybe two at best.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The embarrassment is that political culture in America is such that we can’t have an adult conversation about the lessons of Benghazi, a conversation that would focus more on understanding al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa, on the limitations and imperfections of security, and on shortfalls in our intelligence gathering, than on who said what when in the Rose Garden.</p>
