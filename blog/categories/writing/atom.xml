    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past week (and then some) I’ve read so many stories that have done an excellent job articulating something I’ve been feeling for awhile now: the Internet sucks, and this is a new thing. I’ve tried to <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/05/01/where-i-fit-on-the-web/">put this into words</a> before, but the below articles do a better job.</p>

<p>The Internet is a vast landscape, yet all the same garbage bubbles up to the top these days. I don’t have any answers, but I do know it’s something we should be vigilant about. The web is too important to give up on. So here’s a reading list enumerating where we are today.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2015/07/self-referential.html">“Self Referential”</a> by Gabe Weatherhead:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s obvious that publishing original content is a fading career opportunity and is being replaced by micro blogs such as Medium, Twitter and even Instagram. Not only do I think these are replacing individual blogs, such as this site, but I believe they are actively speeding the demise of original work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426">“The Web We Have to Save”</a> by Hossein Derakhshan:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online today than it was in the past. New, different, and challenging ideas get suppressed by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/07/16/escaping-the-new-media-cargo-c.html">“Escaping the new media cargo cult”</a> by David Moldawer:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you blame Facebook, Buzzfeed, HuffPo, or “algorithms,” the new media landscape has grown a big fat mainstream of its own. Not at one particular site, but in the sense of a particular mechanic of creative expression: tailored for clicks, pasteurized, <em>grabby</em>. The long tail of odd and authentic content is bigger than ever, but if you find your content the way most people do, through the algorithmically warped suggestions in your social media feeds, the stuff you stumble onto feels less like <em>writing</em> and more like <em>wordage</em>, a sort of tips-and-tragedies lorem ipsum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-cannot-let-the-internet-trolls-win/2015/07/16/91b1a2d2-2b17-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html?tid=sm_tw">“The trolls are winning the battle for the Internet”</a> by Ellen Pao:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Internet started as a bastion for free expression. It encouraged broad engagement and a diversity of ideas. Over time, however, that openness has enabled the harassment of people for their views, experiences, appearances or demographic backgrounds. Balancing free expression with privacy and the protection of participants has always been a challenge for open-content platforms on the Internet. But that balancing act is getting harder. The trolls are winning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s Friday, so let’s end on a high note. Here’s a link to the instructions for <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/11/time-for-a-drink-penicillin-cocktail.html">the Penicillin</a>, a cocktail my pal Noah turned me on to <a href="https://twitter.com/poritsky/status/587301642208317441">with a tweet</a>. And <a href="http://www.shakeandstrainblog.com/?p=3080">here’s a video</a> of its inventor, Sam Ross, demonstrating how to properly make it. The Internet doesn’t <em>always</em> suck, it seems.</p>

    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/07/10/my-first-field-notes/"/>

    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/07/10/my-first-field-notes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/2015/07/first-fn-cover.jpg" title="My First Field Notes" ></p>

<p>Last night I decided to tidy up my collection of <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes memo books</a>. For a few years now I’ve kept one in my back pocket everywhere I go. Even if most days I don’t grab for it, I’m happy to have it there just in case.</p>

<p>After organizing my unused and sealed books, I went to put my filled up books in order.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> With few exceptions, almost every memo book I’ve written in has functioned as a sort of ongoing journal. To-do lists, creative pieces and work-related notes are often mixed in with more diaristic writing, but there is certainly an order to the books.</p>

<p>While flipping through pages to find the dates they were started and finished<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> last night, I came across my first Field Notes memo book. I actually remember picking up that first three-pack, a limited edition <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/ravens-wing/">Raven’s Wing</a> from 2010, at <a href="http://www.mcnallyjackson.com">McNally-Jackson</a>, one of the great NYC book stores, long before I knew that these little notebooks would become pined after by collectors.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I was surprised to find a notebook that actually said flat out that it was the first of the collection. When I opened up this little black book, there it was staring me in the face. My first Field Notes. An occasion worth calling out back then, apparently.</p>

<p>The next thing that surprised me was how specific the entry was about my relationship to digital tools, and how excited I seemed to be to be putting pen to paper once again. I had no idea, back in 2011, that writing in Field Notes would become a habit. But it has.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be fun to post the first thing I ever wrote in a Field Notes here on <em>the candler blog</em>. This was never supposed to see the light of day, but I rather like reading it again four years down the line. I wonder what other little nuggets are hidden within my collection of little filled notebooks.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> So here it is: what a twenty-six year-old version of myself thought about writing his thoughts out by hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3/2/11</p>

  <p>Picked up my first Field Notes pack today. I’m not positive, but I believe this is my first notebook purchase since the iPad. Most of my writing has moved to an all digital format, something I’ve dreamed of from a young age. I had a Palm, and always wanted to try an iPaq because it seemed like a palm sized computer. But nothing compares to the ubiquity of the iPad and the iPhone.</p>

  <p>I now produce more content than ever before, and of a higher caliber than any other point in my writing life. My digital workflow is refined and something elegant. But not writing in notebooks has also taken its toll on me. I rarely write digital work that goes unpublished, whereas most of my notebook work has never been seen by anyone other than myself.</p>

  <p>In other words, on the computer, I rarely do any creative exploration anymore. My old notebooks are full of half-cocked stories.</p>

  <p>But enough about that. I’m going to try to get back in the swing of putting pen to paper and see how I do. I have atrocious handwriting. Digital acquisition has always been something of a favor to myself. Let’s see if I can even read my own writing.</p>

<p>Two quick editorial notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I checked and I <em>had</em> been producing “more content than ever before” back in 2011; whether it was all that great (ugh, “high caliber,” Jon?) is something I’m scared to go back and adjudicate.</li>
  <li>Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAQ">iPAQs</a>?</li>
</ul>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For the curious here’s the breakdown:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>14 Sealed Packs (13 3-packs and 1 <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/artsandsciences/">Arts and Sciences</a> 2-pack)</li>
        <li>30 Singles</li>
        <li>30 Full Books</li>
      </ul>

      <p>101 books, plus the one I’m using right now. And honsetly I think a few more are hiding around the house…<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I haven’t filled out the inside covers on most of my books, which would have made this process easy. And no, I didn’t fill them out last night either.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>There’s a listing for a sealed Raven’s Wing 3-pack <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/SEALED-3-PACK-Field-Notes-Memo-Book-Ravens-Wing-RARE-/181771274795?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a52698a2b">on eBay going for $150</a>, which is high but actually not that much more than many would pay. There were only 15,000 of these books printed. For comparison, the latest “Colors” edition, <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/workshop/">Workshop Companion</a>, was a run of 102,000 books. It’s not exactly apples-to-apples (there are six unique Workshop books in each box wheras all the Raven’s Wing were the same), but suffice it to say: older editions are scarecer, and collectors are always on the lookout.</p>

      <p>Speaking of which, if anyone has a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/justbelowzero/">Just Below Zero</a> set they’d like to part with, <a href="http://candlerblog.com/contact/">be in touch</a>.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>I don’t revisit them often, because, <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/2008/08/01/good-for-records-precious-memories/">as the motto goes</a>: “I’m not writing it down to remember it later. I’m writing it down to remember it now.”<a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/05/01/where-i-fit-on-the-web/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-01T15:59:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/05/01/where-i-fit-on-the-web</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The web is such a different place today than it was when I first started publishing a blog in 2006. It’s bigger and, honestly, dumber. Social ate websites, and BuzzFeed ate everything else. Sometimes I have trouble figuring out where I fit in. But I know I <em>do</em> fit in.</p>

<p>I’ve been fairly quiet around these parts because I get stopped up for the silliest reasons. I wonder if anyone is listening anymore. Worse, I wonder how I can break through the clogged arteries of the web. If something seems unlikely to hit, I back off and wait for  the next inspiration to come.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long <em>the candler blog</em> will last, but here’s what I do know.</p>

<p>This website has given me a small side-career as a writer. I’ve interviewed some extremely interesting people, covered film festivals and forged relationships with people all over the world I never would have had access to if not for the words I’ve written here over the years. That’s not something I can give up easily.</p>

<p>Not to sound too out of touch, but I find many of the biggest trends in media to be passing fads. I don’t know if Facebook will make sense in 20 years. I don’t think nostalgic quizzes and listicles will have value in the long run. That doesn’t mean they are without value today, but I don’t think it’s wise to hitch one’s wagon to something that doesn’t look like it will last. This, by the way, is why I’m so reticent to <a href="http://candlerblog.com/2015/02/24/i-really-want-you-to-read-me/">give my words over to Medium</a>. Maybe it’s because I’m old enough to remember the last dot-com bust, but the party can’t last forever.</p>

<p>My own website is a simple proposition. Here’s a space where I can put out the best writing I’m capable of. I own every pixel here. That concept will never go out of fashion, even if it fades from the limelight.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know whether or not there will always be a Google or a Facebook to help readers find me. I do know that I’m in control of whether or not there’s a <em>candler blog</em>.</p>

<p>So I guess I fit in right here. Thanks for reading.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Real people aren’t fictional characters. They don’t follow a plot. None of us wakes up in the morning with the aim of advancing our narrative or reinforcing our core themes. Instead, we simply live, pursuing our interests while adapting to the changing circumstances around us. It’s messy. It’s unwritten.</p>
