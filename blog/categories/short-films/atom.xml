    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>LOCAL</em> is a very cool <a href="https://vimeo.com/119118862">short skate film</a> by Sean Slobodan.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/119118862 "></iframe></div></p>

<p>The film’s description of how they got the closing shot of the moon is great:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was shooting from a little over a mile away in massive field. Because this was just on the top of a dirt hill we had to build about a 100 foot track made out of plywood for Daniel to skate on. … Ultimately there were probably 20 people who helped make this shot possible.</p>

<p>I came across the work of <a href="http://vimeo.com/rlyons">Robert Lyons</a> today on Vimeo. He posts (and links to) a lot of experimental and animation work in addition to his own films. Here’s how he describes the above piece, “The Filmmaker”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A combination of 2-D cut-out animation, 3-D clay animation, and a little bit of pixilation, I made this film in 1979 shooting with a 16mm Canon Scoopic camera. This is currently the oldest animated film of mine that I have posted, and was created when I was in college at SUNY, New Paltz, when I was 20 years old. This was my earliest attempt at doing clay animation. The music “Communication Breakdown” by Led Zeppelin was added recently, as the original film was silent. It was chosen because it related to the theme of the film and was of the time period from which the film was made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really enjoy this little film, though I think he should have left it silent. Zeppelin just doesn’t work here for me. Perhaps I’m being influenced by the fact that it’s so much cleaner and crisper than the picture. In any event, it’s easy enough to hit mute. I wonder what other goodies Robert will be uploading.</p>
