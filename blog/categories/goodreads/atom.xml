<h3 id="my-review">My review</h3>

<p>](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/53805874) rating: 4 of 5 stars This
book it tough to swallow as it humanizes one of the most vile people in
history, Adolf Hitler. However, once I allowed myself to get into the book, I
saw the genius behind Mailer’s work. If we humanize a man by seeing him
through the eyes of a devil, what does that say about us? Layers and questions
fill this book, making it more of a stimulating read than an informational
one. Also, Mailer’s prose is incredible here. He is like a chameleon, entering
an older dialect for an older tale. I knew he was great, just didn’t realize
he was so diverse. A master of letters! (exclamation points add to the book’s
charm. check it out.</p>
