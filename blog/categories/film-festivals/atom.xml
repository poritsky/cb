    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first piece for <a href="http://turnstylenews.com/2012/03/09/sxsw-film-preview-dont-judge-a-fest-by-its-centerpieces/">Turnstyle News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These screenings are basically marketing ploys, booked to help build positive buzz (ugh, did I really just use that word?) about a film before its release. A skilled marketer can pick out fests that will work to the advantage of the project at hand, but a misfire won’t really hurt a film’s image all that much. The reason is simple: festival audiences tend to really like movies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I come to SXSW this year without having seen a single film in advance, not even the shorts. The linked piece here is about how these big screenings sometimes seem out of place, but ultimately it’s a win-win for everyone, including the makers of smaller, indie fare.</p>

<p>Give it a read. More to come at Turnstyle during the fest.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Michel Hazanavicius is a master of the homage. By that I mean he is an
incredibly well-versed movie nerd, approaching cinema history as gospel; the
movie house his cathedral. His latest film, <em>The Artist</em>, is a love letter to
Classical Hollywood Cinema, that bygone era since obliterated by the New
Hollywood filmmakers of the 1960s and 1970s. The film follows the travails of
a silent film actor during the rise of sound in the early 1930s and is itself
a silent film, in black and white, in the legacy 1.37:1 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>It seems there is a question as to whether or not audiences will actually go
and watch a silent film, but I think it’s a foolish thing to wonder about it.
There was a golden age of silent cinema for a reason. We have outgrown that
form but we’re not immune to enjoying it. If you can get a modern moviegoer to
sit down and watch <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> or, better, <em>The Last Laugh</em>, I think
that most people would actually have an enjoyable time. The form <em>can</em> be
timeless, but Hazanavicius offers us something much more palpable than
reminiscing over times gone by. He has given us a film that is eminently
watchable, engaging for both the armchair historian and the blockbuster-goer
alike.</p>

<p>In cinematic terms, modern conventions have allowed filmmakers and audiences
to lull into laziness. Widescreen formats, color film and bloated soundtracks
have allowed us all to neglect convention without much consequence. A terrible
cut can be corrected (or bandaged) with the right sound effect; a vertical
frame is more difficult to fill than a wide one; black and white art direction
can be more nuanced than color.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Where some may see nothing but challenges
in silent filmmaking, Hazanavicius sees opportunities. Like a blind man who
elevates his hearing, Hazanavicius’ other sensibilities congeal to become
pitch perfect. <em>The Artist</em> is an exercise in montage, a wonderful use of
imagery to tell a story that is exciting, new and repeatedly surprising.</p>

<p>I should mention the most exuberantly non-silent aspect of the film, the music
of Ludovic Bource. Much in the way that Hazanavicius is a master of cinematic
homage, Bource has composed an impeccable score that shines throughout the
film. The music rises and dips and twirls with our main character. Just like
the visuals, the music is both modern and derivative (sometimes explicitly).
It’s absolutely charming and the film would be nothing without it.</p>

<p>The question remains: will anyone actually see <em>The Artist</em>. I most certainly
hope so. At its core, it is a heartfelt film with all of the elements modern
moviegoers enjoy at the movies: love, drama, laughs and a spunky Jack Russell
Terrier who deserves an Oscar nod. If people aren’t lining up to see it, it
will be a real shame.</p>

<p>find a clip of François Truffaut speaking about widescreen formats and how it
changes how he directs actors, but I’ll have to <a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D62Uatesc">settle for this
one</a> in
which he talks briefly about color versus black and white film.</p>

    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/13/nyff-11-review-cormans-world-exploits-of-a-hollywood-rebel/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a real shame when I tell people “I just saw a documentary about Roger
Corman” and they ask “Who?” <em>Who?</em> Somehow Corman has been pushed to the wings
of the story of American cinema. The much ballyhooed “New Hollywood” of the
1970s may never have come of age without him, yet his name has been all but
rubbed out by the stars who would outshine him. Alex Stapleton’s excellent
<em>Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel</em> aims to put the spotlight back
on the man who changed the game for generations of filmmakers.</p>

<p>Roger Corman’s greatest talent has been making movies, and I mean that in the
most literal sense. The number of films with his name attached is astounding,
perhaps approaching one thousand by this point.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Corman turned his
operation into a well-oiled machine, one that could make films in less than a
week. His goal was never to re-invent the wheel, the thing that holds up the
Stanley Kubricks and the Paul Thomas Andersons of the world, but to be able to
make as many movies that could find an audience as possible.</p>

<p>has him at 395 as producer and 56 as director (mostly overlapping), but that
doesn’t account for everything he’s touched.</p>

<p>His stylings led him to be one of the most successful B-movie and exploitation
producers of all time, but there is a lot more to him. As it turns out, he is
rather offended by his reputation as a maker of trashy camp. As Stapleton’s
film explores, his life’s work has been less about making “bad” movies and
more about making films that tap into what audiences want. Yes, that has meant
a lot of breasts and a <em>lot</em> of explosions, but also a lot of work that, even
when it was forgettable, became the training ground for some of the world’s
top talent. Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard, Jonathan Demme and Francis Ford
Coppola are just a few of the names to have found their start under Corman’s
tutelage.</p>

<p>But what of the documentary at hand? Stapleton has made a great biography of a
man who history may soon forget. Even though his work is both prolific and
extremely accessible today<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> he is still somewhat unknown among younger
generations of cinephiles. Stapleton’s film elegantly, and enjoyably, moves to
correct that. It also tries to explain it. Just as it seems the book is closed
on Corman, Stapleton introduces a new villain: Steven Spielberg. One of the
film’s conceits, sparked by those close to Corman, is that <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Star
Wars</em> represented a major shift in the way the studios went after younger
audiences. These were basically Corman movies with massive budgets, and it all
but put him out of business, or at least pushed him into obscurity.</p>

<p>Netflix Watch Instantly.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting theory, but I’m not so sure I believe it. It’s often said
that those blockbusters were the turning point, downward, for American cinema;
they’re the reason why there are nothing but loud comic book movies in
theaters today. The biggest hole in that theory is that if the studios found a
way to attract audiences with Corman-esque films, couldn’t Corman simply step
in and become <em>more</em> successful? If Stapleton trips here, it is only because
she is too enthralled with her subject.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, <em>Corman’s World</em> is an excellent watch and a damn good time. The
doc features excellent closing credits in the grindhouse vain and a number of
artistic interstitials (enjoy the poster montage). Interviews with stars big
and small, young and old make for a great Hollywood tell-all, but the best
footage comes from a wonderfully unguarded interview with Jack Nicholson. If
you love Corman, don’t miss this one; if you don’t know who he is, get your
ass to a theater and learn something.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Corman’s World</em> will be screening as part of the New York Film Festival on Sunday, October 16 and 1:30pm with a special screening of Corman’s 1962 <em>The Intruder</em> starring William Shatner.

    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/10/nyff-11-review-my-week-with-marilyn/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-10T18:29:36+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/10/10/nyff-11-review-my-week-with-marilyn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Simon Curtis’s <em>My Week With Marilyn</em> is very much a Weinstein Company release. It is an impersonation romp more suited to the small screen than to the cinema. Replete with stunning performances, a corny soundtrack and uninspired technique, it is the stuff that the brothers Weinstein know how to spin into gold. And, much like <em>The King’s Speech</em> of last year, it will likely overcome its own mediocrity and dazzle awards voters all season long. It is the easiest answer to the Best Picture question.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the performances. Michelle Williams gets very close to brilliance portraying the incomparable Marilyn Monroe, a feat that shouldn’t (and won’t; see above) go uncommended. As complicated as Monroe was in her own time, her image has been Xeroxed, caricatured, overdone and parodied to death since her passing. It would be too easy for Williams to do Marilyn burlesque, a sort of recreation of the woman through her on-screen manifests. Thankfully, she becomes something more; a woman playing the part of the woman she wishes she could be.</p>

<p>The role, however, falls short of illuminating too much outside of what the dialogue spoon-feeds us. Throughout the lumbering screenplay we are told that Marilyn is a broken woman who uses up the people around her. We wait for her to pulverize our hero, the young Colin Clark played by Eddie Redmayne. Colin is the son of an aristocrat who wishes to run off and make movies, eventually landing a gig as the third assistant director on a new film by Sir Laurence Olivier starring Monroe. Olivier is played by Kenneth Branagh, a Briton who has earned a stature similar to the man he is portraying. Much like Williams, Brangh does his damnedest to sidestep farce and imbue his Olivier with only the slightest hint of homage, bringing out a spark of something more than the man we would see so many times on screen.</p>

<p>So, young Colin Clark finds himself amidst giants, with the greatest actor in the world teaming up alongside the hottest commodity in Hollywood. And he has seemingly unfettered access to both. Marilyn shows up late to set on a regular basis and is always accompanied by a cabal of handlers, the most vocal of whom is her acting coach, Paula Strasberg (Zoë Wanamaker). In a bit of backstage cleverness, this matchup of stars sets up a clash of acting styles. Monroe is fascinated by Colin who treats her as a woman instead of as a piece of meat. And so the two frolic for a fleeting period, at the expense of Colin’s untimely meet-cute with a wardrobe girl, Lucy (Emma Watson).</p>

<p>Since the Curtis is winkingly telling a tale of the filmmaking process (method acting’s rise, on-set union clashes, a new age of celebrity worship, etc.) perhaps it would have done him some good to revisit Syd Field or even Aristotle. The story is shoddy and the characters learn nothing. Worse, very little is at stake for our young hero who is forced to choose between beautiful and most beautiful. An aristocrat trying to make a name for himself <em>can</em> be a compelling story, but in this case Colin has so little to lose we have no reason to care. His love of Monroe never transcends schoolboy infatuation, yet we are expected to believe him when he asks the starlet to run away together. It’s going to take a lot more than charm and sweater-vests to bark up that tree.</p>

<p>With all this talk of story, I should perhaps be lambasting screenwriter Adrian Hodges, but I’m not so sure that’s where things first went wrong. There are a lot of elements of the story that <em>could</em> work and play instead as missed opportunities. The culture clash of actors abroad and the mental state of a young Monroe (before <em>Some Like it Hot</em>, before Kennedy) are brilliant fodder for a great story. All of the pieces are there on screen but they never cohere into something that goes beyond lecturing; they never form together to make cinema.</p>

<p>The fault then, I suspect, should lie with director Simon Curtis, but perhaps there is more at work here. I can’t get over how similar this film feels to <em>The King’s Speech</em>. Stylistically on almost every count, even down to those damned wide lenses, <em>Marilyn</em> mimics the prior film. Can it be, then, that the Weinsteins are to blame? Harvey has a long history of watering down films in order to land an Oscar, but I think that process has now flipped around, inviting filmmakers to keep their aspirations in check and take the easiest route possible. It’s a real shame, because there’s a great story trying to break through here, with a world-class cast dying to do good. Unfortunately, it never comes together into something more than “just okay.”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quick shout out to the Deadcenter Film Festival out in Oklahoma City. I went
out there in 2009 and it became the <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/17/full-deadcenter-coverage/">first film festival I ever
covered</a>. You
never forget your first time…</p>

<p>I haven’t been back since, but it’s a great fest that looks to have a pretty
