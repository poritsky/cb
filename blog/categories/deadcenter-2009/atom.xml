    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/17/deadcenter-review-comedy-shorts/"/>
    <updated>2009-06-17T09:45:56+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/17/deadcenter-review-comedy-shorts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The comedy short has a long and illustrious history in cinema. In modern
times, the art is still alive but exhibition spaces are limited. As a result,
film festivals have become the number one destination for these little films.
deadCENTER has its share of shorts programs, but I was only able to check out
the comedy section because I needed a laugh. Did I get one? Let’s take a look.</p>

<h4 id="ten-for-grandpa---dir-doug-karr">Ten For Grandpa - dir. Doug Karr</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/tenforgrandpa-300x200.jpg" alt="Ten For Grandpa Still" />This slick little short follows a man wondering who
his departed grandfather really was. The camera flows between scenes, across
time, and across rooms to create the illusion of fluidity. This is extremely
well executed, but I do wonder how much of this film actually qualifies as
comedy. If anything is a joke, it seems to be the efforts the filmmakers went
to to pull off these shots. Every time we enter a new space we are supposed to
be wowed into a laugh; the form is so over the top for such a little film. The
choice of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio seems like an arbitrary choice; the piece
may be funnier with more vertical space. Of course, we would lose that
slickness. <em>T__en for Grandpa</em> is tight, well executed, well_ <em>acted, and
fully realized.</em> _Overall, it is a very strong piece and I want to see more
from all involved.</p>

<h4 id="the-last-page---dirkevin-acevedo">The Last Page - dir. Kevin Acevedo</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/thelastpage-300x169.jpg" alt="The Last Page Still" />The best part of this short is the Dodge College
opening logo. Its self-assuredness provided me the biggest laugh all day, but
sadly, all logos must end. The film goes on to depict the terribly tired
premise of a writer envisioning the final page of his novel. The writer goes
for a walk ends in him getting into all kinds of “wacky trouble”. I realize
this is a student film, but still, it is fraught with problems. Again we have
an unjustified 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The biggest issue of all is the runtime.
At 22 minutes, the piece is more than twice as long as there is story. Most
offensively, the laughs are unexplained. Why, Mr. Acevedo, is it funny when a
rotund woman grabs the writer’s crotch? If you are out there, defend your
joke. And to the professors at Dodge College at Chapman University, please
guide your students to kill their favorite babies and cut their pieces down to
size.</p>

<h4 id="the-spam-job---dirpadraic-culham">The SPAM Job - dir. Padraic Culham</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06
/thespamjob-300x203.jpg" alt="The Spam Job" />Stone faced after the last bit of drek, I was
determined not to laugh once through this cheap-looking documentary, but it
wore me down over time. I couldn’t help but chuckle by the end. Through
interviews and photos, the story of one prankster’s stolen spam becomes
clearer and clearer. It sounds dumb and that is the point. The joke here seems
to be on us for making it through the whole damn story. This “cheap” feeling I
mentioned only adds to the charm of the piece, you simply don’t expect how far
they are willing to take this joke about a can of spam ending up in different
locales across the globe. The piece is a little fat, could be cut down to
size. I could see this as a sketch on a late-night comedy show, that is if Mr.
Culham and friends have any other notes up their sleeves.</p>

<h4 id="cherchez-la-femme---dir-idit-dvir">Cherchez la femme - dir. Idit Dvir</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/chercezlafemme-300x190.jpg" alt="Chercez La Femme Still" />Comedy has a darker side
that is briefly explored in this short. A man dressed like a taco wants to
kill himself over a woman until he finds a friend in another suicidal man with
far different love troubles. Slowly we learn that the man’s wife cheats on him
while he is home, so the taco concocts a plot to kill her off. The film takes
too long to get to very little payoff, though one of the purest laughs during
the shorts program came out of the film. Once the murder is imminent, the
murderer must continue having sex with his victim through tears. As an
audience, we are left with no emotional output except laughter because our
other options simply won’t do given the rest of the film. This one laugh is
impressive, but it doesn’t make up for the slow pace of the rest of the film,
not to mention the pre-required misogyny one needs to find humor throughout.
Ms. Dvir assumes a lot about her audience’s beliefs: that walking tacos are
funny, that promiscuous women are sluts, and that murder is a natural
progression from anger. Focusing in on these muddled corners will help to make
better work in the future.</p>

<h4 id="toms-day-off---dirjustin-stanley">Tom’s Day Off - dir. Justin Stanley</h4>

<p>Sigh. I believe in film criticism as a tool to help filmmakers better their
work over time, but when I am given nothing to work with I feel there is
nothing I can offer. This is how I feel about <em>Tom’s Day Off</em>. It’s such a
mess that I would rather the filmmaker, Justin Stanley, go make something else
and bring it back so I can actually give some critique. Apparently, after
being dumped a lanky bank employee chooses to rob his place of business. Then
he ends up in the back seat of a student driver’s vehicle with no plan. There
are no laughs, no plot, no aesthetic quality to speak of. Mr. Stanley probably
thinks he’s a genius with his use of an inner monologue interspersed with
diegetic dialogue. The bigger question is what place this film has in any film
festival. The 10 minutes of space this took up could have been used so much
better.</p>

<h4 id="miracle-investigators---dirjeremy-dehn">Miracle Investigators - dir. Jeremy Dehn</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/miracleinvestigators-300x202.jpg" alt="Miracle Investigators Still" />The program finished
off with this crowd pleaser. Overall, this is a lame mashup of kung fu action
and outdated church humor. Still, the laughs are there, and that is
respectable for a student film thrown into this mix. The film follows two
priests charged with meting out justice against perpetrators of false
miracles. Unfortunately, this goofy premise never really comes to fruition.
The film bumbles along from joke to joke with a plot that hardly makes any
sense. It seems that it didn’t matter since the laughs were there. The makers
of this film would do better to cut it down to about a 5 minute sketch and
really focus in on each joke. Nonetheless, a valiant effort.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Andrew-
Windy-Boy.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/Andrew-Windy-Boy-
300x168.jpg" alt="Still from Our Spirits Don't Speak English" /></a>If you were paying close attention even in the most progressive
of U.S. public schools, odds are you were never made aware of the full extent
to which Native Americans have been maligned by their Euro-Christian
counterparts. Sure, you know it’s a bad history, a dark history, but that was
centuries ago, right? A sobering wake-up call could be found in Steven R.
Heape and Chip Richie’s <em>Our Spirits Don’t Speak English: Indian Boarding
Schools</em>.</p>

<p>The film is a straightforward educational documentary complete with
interviews, photos, re-enactments and the readings of historical texts. It
tells the tale of government and church financed boarding schools whose goal
was to reform Native Americans, to make them more like their white neighbors.
The facts are harrowing. In short, children were taken from their homes into
the schools where their hair was cut, they were forced to speak english, and
slowly the destruction of a culture set in for generations to come. If this is
a topic that interests you you should absolutely <a href="http://www.richheape.com/boarding-school.htm">check out the
film</a>. There isn’t the space
here to get too deep into the facts.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, the film is nothing special, which is fine because the goal is
to directly educate. The topic is so sweeping, so important, that it may be
too difficult for the filmmakers to build an emotional narrative. I won’t
excuse this as I believe this story would find a wider viewership if such a
task were undertaken. The interview with Andrew Windy Boy, pictured above, is
the strongest part of the piece. He spends much of his time on camera in
tears, remembering the darkest pockets of his childhood. Mr. Windy Boy alone
could fill a feature length documentary, but here he is only one piece of the
puzzle. ( I do not want to minimize the stories of the other interviewees by
any means, I am using Andrew as one example.)</p>

<p><em>Our Spirits Don’t Speak English</em> is an important film that reveals a story
that needs to be told before this generation of Native Americans can no longer
tell it. However, it does not feel like the kind of documentary that runs in
festivals. It reads like a book, not as much as a narrative docu. Perhaps I am
too demanding, or perhaps the art of the educational film is lost on me.
Regardless, I would recommend showing this film in schools across the country.
We need to know the extent of our misdeeds as a nation, and <em>Our Spirits Don’t
Speak English</em> exposes a great deal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2009 deadCENTER Film Festival has come to an end. It’s been a fun ride
indeed. I saw some good films, I made some good friends, and I discovered a
town that I had never been to before. Oklahoma City is an interesting place
for film. There are many many makers out here and an increasing slate of
productions for people to find work on. The biggest gap to a thriving film
community here seems to be the availability of art house, fringe and repertory
film screening spaces. Once a year, when this festival rolls into town, the
citizens of Oklahoma City get a nice helping of the films that don’t get out
here. They need more, but the fest represents a nice start.</p>

<p>To be honest, I only went to 2 screenings yesterday which I will post about
either later today or tomorrow. It has been a whirlwind few days here and
there is finally a nice reprieve. I’ll be here a few more days touring around.
I will keep you all up to date, especially on film news. Interestingly, I’m
currently at a book signing at a local book store. The book, <em>Sooner Cinema:
Oklahoma Goes to the Movies</em>, features an essay fro my good friend (and future
candler contributor, watch for it) Sunrise Tippeconnie. The book just came
out, otherwise I would have read it in advance to help understand this state a
little better. No matter, as more film related info comes to me, you’ll get
it. Here are some pics from closing night, enjoy.</p>
