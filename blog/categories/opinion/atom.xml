    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember reading Ben Brooks’s <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/failure/">takedown of <em>The Verge</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in December and thinking he was on to something, but that I wasn’t quite ready to call bullshit on the site and its writers. Now I am.</p>

<p>It’s been a bad week for <a href="http://www.theverge.com/"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the tech news clearinghouse started by former-Engadget staffers last year and part of the growing <a href="http://www.voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> empire. With a slick “magazine-like” layout and loads of ways to interact with the site, the team there has undoubtedly built an incredible online presence. Their video content is second-to-none, their forums are full of informed nerdy-types and their long-form feature pieces look amazing in a Web browser. The trouble is the content itself, which this week proved to be weak, shameful, unconscionable or all of the above. So I’m done with them.</p>

<h3 id="weak">Weak</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/verge-hed-1.jpg" title="The Paperwhite “Exclusive”" ></p>

<p>Let’s start with the pieces leading up to Amazon’s Kindle announcement this week. The first red flag for me was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3280770/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-display/in/3061995">this August 30th piece</a> by Chris Ziegler with the headline “Exclusive: meet the Amazon Kindle with ‘Paperwhite’ backlit display.” I was excited to see this headline because, well <em>The Verge</em> is a big-time outlet and Chris, who I’ve been reading for years, is a real-deal tech journalist. So I was confused when I got to the page and saw 200 words with an image gallery containing seven images, each with “<em>The Verge</em>” burned into the corner.</p>

<p>My first problem was the use of the word exclusive. I’m used to film outlets abusing the term, but I wasn’t prepared for <em>The Verge</em> to play fast and loose with it. To me, and really to english-speaking readers the world over, exclusive in a headline means more than just images, but analysis and original writing you won’t find anywhere else. And the rest of the headline? When I “meet” a new device I usually get more than some pics and a glorified caption.</p>

<p>Worst of all was Ziegler’s content, which said nothing. Where did the images come from? How did <em>The Verge</em> obtain them? Why aren’t they in English? Nothing. Not even a passing reference. Which is everything. When I didn’t see any form of sourcing in the short piece, my first thought was that Amazon “leaked” the images to <em>The Verge</em>, and if that’s the case, then, as journalists, they failed me as a reader. If they have a source and a scoop they have an obligation to share as much information as they can get their hands on.</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I am not accusing Ziegler or <em>The Verge</em> of regurgitating a fake leak from Amazon. However, without their own explanation of the images’ provenance, as a reader I am left to my own devices to assume where they came from. Without anything of value in Chris’s copy, what am I to think?</p>

<h3 id="shameful">Shameful</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/verge-hed-2.jpg" title="The Amazon Phone “Exclusive”" ></p>

<p>Then came <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/5/3294569/exclusive-amazon-phone-confirmed-could-be-announced-tomorrow">Nilay Patel’s head-scratcher</a> this past Wednesday: “Exclusive: Amazon phone confirmed, could be announced tomorrow.” This heavy-handed (and impossible) headline was followed by a mere 182 words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multiple sources have confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that Amazon is working on a smartphone that runs a variant of the Kindle Fire’s Android-based operating system, and we’re now hearing that the device will be shown to the press tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That headline is shameful. It treats us, as readers, like complete idiots whose clicks need to be bilked out of us at all costs. The “Exclusive” at the front is annoying even if warranted (though of course I would like to read a more in depth-piece). The trouble is that the headline indicates two different pieces of information that aren’t exactly backed up in Patel’s copy, and one of which isn’t confirmed at all.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about that confirmation for a moment. The headline says, “Amazon phone confirmed,” but the piece says “Multiple sources have confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that Amazon is working on a smartphone.” <em>Working</em>. Nilay is, ostensibly, confirming nothing. Companies work on all kinds of devices that never see the light of day. Patel squandered a more interesting angle (<em>what</em> are they working on?) to get a flashy headline out there.</p>

<p>And that whole “could be” thing? I don’t think I need to explain why saying, consecutively, “confirmed, could be” needs to be explained away. And the copy says “we’re now hearing that the device will be shown to the press tomorrow,” which sounds like as much of a confirmation as the angle on the phone’s existence. So the piece doesn’t even back up the headline.</p>

<p>Why does this bother me? Alone, it’s a sad case of link-bait, but combine it with Ziegler’s previous “exclusive” and the hamster in my head gets back on his wheel. How does one outlet get two non-starter exclusives from the same company in one week? The only conclusion I can think of is that Amazon is leaking them stories they want out there. Again, I have no proof of this and this is not an accusation. But <em>The Verge</em> isn’t giving me a better narrative. </p>

<h3 id="unconscionable">Unconscionable</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012/09/verge-hed-3.jpg" title="The Looper Hyperbole" ></p>

<p>Finally, yesterday afternoon <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3295978/film-review-looper">Bryan Bishop published the most hyperbolic headline yet</a>: “Film review: ‘Looper’ reinvents the sci-fi film with a mix of humanity and adventure.” It’s all fun and games when <em>The Verge</em> disappoints me while covering the tech space, but now they’re covering movies too?</p>

<p>I’ll be seeing the film soon at Fantastic Fest and I’m avoiding reviews, so I haven’t read Bishop’s take, but the headline is preposterous on its face because he isn’t a film critic <em>and</em> he’s not writing for a film outlet. As such, it’s impossible to trust his word that a film could reinvent any genre.</p>

<p>Annoying. But it gets worse.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half after publication, <em>Verge</em> reader “slipslip” posted <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3295978/film-review-looper#113773349">this comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since it is somewhat unusual for The Verge to review and cover movies (even sci-fi ones), it seems like it might be appropriate for Bryan to add a “full disclosure” addendum to the article about his personal friendship with the director, which I believe was mentioned in The Verge’s post featuring the interview with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bishop concurred:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I agree, slipslip, I’ve just added one. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And added this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Full disclosure: Bryan Bishop and Mr. Johnson attended college together, a topic we discuss in our interview with the director.]<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, it’s discouraged for film critics to do interview pieces for films they plan to review, even when they didn’t go to college with the filmmaker. Secondly, “thanks for the suggestion”? On what planet is disclosure a suggestion? Bishop had an obligation to tell the readers his relationship to the filmmaker from the get-go, and no, linking to another piece where he drops that bit of info (and not in a disclosure, mind you) doesn’t count.</p>

<p>Do I need to do the math on this? <em>The Verge</em> doesn’t regularly do movie reviews. When they do it’s a glowing review of one their News Manager’s college pals. This is more than dubious, it’s downright scandalous. Shame on the site’s entire staff for allowing this to be published under their logo without disclosure.</p>

<h3 id="im-done">I’m Done</h3>

<p>The journalistic standards <em>The Verge’s</em> staff have displayed in the past week have been, collectively, the last straw. I don’t need the site in my life to begin with, but they have now broken the one thing a news outlet must preserve in order to keep a reader: trust. I have lost faith in the endeavor completely; I can’t trust anything I read on the site anymore.</p>

<p>So I’m done with <em>The Verge</em>. They may not miss one reader. That’s fine. I won’t miss them either.</p>

    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/30/plagiarism/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-30T16:03:14+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/30/plagiarism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>his “confession” that <a href="http://www.thefix.com/content/confessions-plagiarist-Quentin-rowan9278?page=all">went up on The Fix</a> today is the first I’m hearing about outed plagiarist Quentin Rowan. Under the pseudonym Q.R. Markham, he has been a rising star in the literary world culminating with the publication of his spy novel, <em>Assassin of Secrets</em>, a few weeks ago. It turns out that none of his writing was original, but lifted from a multitude of sources.</p>

<p>In his confession, Rowan tries to explain away his misdeeds, branding plagiarism an addiction that replaced his alcoholism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They call a person like me a Plagiarist. It’s one of the harsher words we have in our language. Perhaps not up there with Pedophile or Rapist, but not as far behind as you’d think either. For years, I’d been dreading being called that word, and marveled all the while that I’d somehow avoided being caught.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, his original writing is pretty terrible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some months after my first [AA] meeting a poem I’d written in high school was picked for the <em>Best American Poetry</em> anthology. I was 19. My ego had already left the building. I should have been at my happiest, getting into my studies and <strong>rejoicing at the blowjob heaven of youth and possibility in those playground groves of academe</strong>. Instead, I spent sleepless nights trying to recapture whatever oddball inspiration I’d had that landed me in the Anthology. (Emphasis mine.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My eyes don’t roll back far enough. I’ll concede that Rowan has a problem and is in need of help, but that’s no excuse for his actions. He committed a crime, a grave one. He will get no sympathy from me.</p>

<p>The whole affair got me thinking about a session I attended at SXSW in March called “<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_FP7446">The Blogger Centipede: How Content is Eroding Credibility</a>.” I wrote a <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/03/16/parsing-out-the-techcrunchmoviefone-debacle/">little bit</a> about it back when it was fresh. The panel was an illustrious group of movie bloggers including <a href="http://twitter.com/akstanwyck">Anne Thompson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/misterpatches">Matt Patches</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/williambgoss">William Goss</a>. In the audience was most of the top- tier online film writers working today. It was a formidable set of professionals who are deadly serious about this business.</p>

<p>The session was about how cribbing content hurts us all; it was basically an intro to not plagiarizing, or how not to be a jerk online. When things moved to Q &amp; A, a woman in the front of the room, who apparently hadn’t been listening too well, asked, “If you could plagiarize anyone, who would it be?” The panel was aghast; the audience groaned. Was she for real? She kept trying to rephrase the same question: who would you steal from if you knew you wouldn’t get caught? The answer, of course, is no one. Plagiarizing other writers undermines the whole concept of writing, and those of us who attended the session were (mostly) people committed to foisting our own opinions on others.</p>

<p>For these many months I’ve given this questioner the benefit of the doubt, assuming that what she meant to say was, “If you had the ability to write as well as any one writer, who would it be?” Now, though, reading Quentin Rowan’s lame defense, I wonder if she meant exactly what she said. Perhaps she was voicing a point of view that comes from the scuzzy underbelly of internet culture, the <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/10/film-critic-apologizes-for-epic-plagiarism-will-continue-to-rev/">same place that led to the panel</a> in the first place. Is the taboo of plagiarism eroding? Is it actually becoming hip to do a veritable super-cut of other writers’ words? If you can tweet a quote and a link, why not blog a quote instead? Why not the whole article? It’s just aggregation, right?</p>

<p>The gap between the standup internet citizen and the internet plagiarist is getting smaller. Rowan is now the poster child for plagiarism, but how long until he is viewed as a rock star? He was anything but lazy, which is why his crimes went unnoticed for so long. Sadly, I wonder if there isn’t a surge of new writers who will be comfortable lifting work from writers far better than themselves.</p>

<p>That woman at SXSW may be one of many who have had right and wrong jumbled up for them. I hope that’s not the case, that everyone can see Rowan and his ilk for what they are: charlatans and thieves. The gift of the Internet is that so many voices can contribute to an unending international conversation. There’s no room left for copycats.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Cough]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/16/cough/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-16T07:17:59+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/11/16/cough</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of you who read this site may not know the ins and outs of Jewish publishing. Frankly, neither do I, but, as a writer and editor at <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/author/Poritsky">Heeb</a>, I’m close enough to the metal that I can set the stage for you.</p>

<p>Tablet Magazine is a wonderful online project with a talented staff and a formidable stable of guest writers. It’s <em>The New Yorker</em> of the Jewish publishing world. Jewcy is a youth-centric blog that was acquired by JDub Records, the label that gave the world Matisyahu, in 2009. JDub also partnered with Tablet in late 2009 but <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/07/12/3088520/innovative-new-jewish-music-nonprofit-jdub-is-closing">folded</a> earlier this year. Yesterday it was announced that the seemingly homeless Jewcy will now be published by Tablet.</p>

<p>Mazel tov!</p>

<p>All would be well and good if not for a slight by Tablet’s intrepid blogger, Marc Tracy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Here he is <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/83280/please-welcome-jewcy-to-tablet/">welcoming Jewcy</a> into his family:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five years ago today, Jewcy was born. Since then, the online-only Jewish magazine that many of you probably already read has gone through several evolutions and changes of management, with, to my reading, one constant: a dedication to engaging young Jews who may not think of themselves as the likeliest readers of a Jewish magazine, and doing so by winking at the conventions of what a Jewish magazine should be without undermining those conventions to the point of standing for nothing at all. (Cough.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his original post, the word cough was linked to Heeb’s main page. Unprovoked, he took the opportunity to winkingly call Heeb out for, if I’m following this correctly, undermining the conventions of a Jewish magazine “to the point of standing for nothing at all.” The joke, by my read, goes past the point of rib-poking. It’s a mean jab that seems out of place in an otherwise meaningful post. I can take it, but I can volley back, nu?</p>

<p>The first thing worth noting is that Heeb predates all the other publications involved here. Perhaps it’s ancient history, but when I hear the words “conventions of a Jewish magazine” my mind immediately goes to Heeb. Before I was a writer I was a reader, and no Jewish publication, not a one, went as far into the mainstream as Heeb did. It was revolutionary. Ultimately, Jewcy and Tablet are taking the road that Heeb paved a decade ago.</p>

<p>But yes, that <em>is</em> ancient history. Things have changed in our little world. Jewcy rose to prominence a few years back (though they’ve been dropping consistently for a year) and Tablet is now one of the dominant forces online. That’s okay, there’s room for a lot of voices, but to suggest that Heeb stands for “nothing at all” is patently false. Our goals are simply different.</p>

<p>We have no interest in seeing a return on our investment by way of Jewish marriages, Jewish babies, Jewish love for Israel or any of the other “goals” that a Jewish magazine <em>could</em> stand for. We don’t prescribe what Jewish life should be. All we aim to do is provide thought provoking writing about the Jewish experience in relation to whatever else is happening in the world. It can be funny, it can be offensive, it can be whatever we want. Former publisher Josh Neuman put it best when we <a href="http://heebmagazine.com/so-much-for-controlling-the-media">suspended print last summer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Heeb Magazine</em> has never been about making Jewish “cool.” What we are big believers in, however, is making Jewish fun. We believe that in a world in which Jewish periodicals outdo themselves in attempting to highlight just how endangered Jews are, there should be one Jewish media outlet that actually makes its readers smile.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t have an agenda, a fact that has hurt us over the years. Damn near killed us, actually. Heeb is viewed as a double-edged sword in the Jewish publishing world. We have the young, unaffiliated audience that none of the other sites can seem to pin down, but we don’t conform to the standards of a hip synagogue newsletter. We take chances and, every so often, we go too far. Sometimes, that makes Jews look bad. But hey, so does tossing an editorial swipe into what amounts to a press release.</p>

<p>Marc, we can talk until we’re blue in the face about what role Heeb should play, what it stands for, what Jewcy stands for, etc. We can argue which site has better content and which reaches what audience. There’s no point though. You’re one of the hardest working writers online and one of my favorite to read to boot. I can’t wrap my head around how many words you get right every single day and I applaud you for it. But this one word, this “cough,” was wrong and you know it. Dick move.</p>

<p>So let’s see how things go for Jewcy under Tablet. Can’t wait.</p>

    <link href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/09/26/207-days/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-26T12:48:44+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2011/09/26/207-days</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just put a red Netflix envelope in the mail for the first time in quite
awhile. I couldn’t remember when I had even gotten the film in the mail, so I
looked it up. March 3rd. 207 days ago. For 29 and a half weeks, the disc had
been sitting in my house, unwatched.</p>

<p>That’s 7 billing cycles.</p>

<p>Up until this month, my 1 Blu-ray a month plan cost $11.99. That means that
single disc cost me $83.93. Sort of.</p>

<p>See, I use Netflix’s Watch Instantly service quite a bit, especially for
catching up on television series. I watch it on my iPad, sometimes (but
rarely) on my iPhone and constantly on my television through a Boxee Box.</p>

<p>Quantifying the value of Watch Instantly can be a bit tricky. Netflix does
retain detailed records of everything you watch, when you watched it and for
how long you watched it, but some of the numbers are a bit weird. When I
watched <em>The Big Lebowski</em> on March 6th, for example, Netflix logged that as 3
hours and 23 minutes. That’s about an hour and a half longer than the film’s
actual runtime.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Suffice it to say, the website’s watch log is inexact, but
it’s all we’ve got.</p>

<p>In the time I’ve had this one disc at home, I’ve watched about 60 hours of
Watch Instantly. In 7 billing cycles, that’s about 8.5<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> hours a month.
Under Netflix’s new pricing, streaming only is $7.99 per month. I’ll stick
with that figure for my streaming math and the remaining $4.00 for my 1 Blu-
ray. Thus, while that 1 disc gathered dust at home, I spent some $55.93 on
streaming and $28.00 to rent this one movie. I spent less than a dollar
($0.94) an hour on Watch Instantly content, on average.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Netflix as a streaming only service is a pretty great deal if you find
something you want to watch. For discs it’s a different story. Under Netflix’s
new rates, which will carry over to Qwikster, a single Blu-ray at a time costs
$9.99 per month without streaming included. In that case, that single
unwatched disc would have cost me $69.93, 25% <em>more</em> than watching 60 hours of
streaming content over 7 months.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s entirely my fault for not returning the disc and having
another one sent. If I had kept a disc from a video store this long, I’d have
probably paid a substantial late fee<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> so I have no real complaints about
how Netflix’s disc service works. The question now, of course, is whether or
not discs are worth paying for if my return habits are so lax.</p>

<p>Prior to this marathon rental, I had a disc for 112 days. Before that I was on
the 3 Blu-ray plan and had 3 films for 69 days. I didn’t watch any of them.
There are a number of contributing factors to the erosion of my disc
diligence, and perhaps I’ll go over some in another post. It’s worth noting
that I’m not necessarily a typical viewer. I see a great deal of films in the
theater and I also go to press screenings, film festivals and get screeners
sent to me. This breakdown is purely anecdotal, but I gather I’m not alone.</p>

<p>At $4.00 a month for Blu-rays, Netflix was the best deal around. Now? I’ve got
to decide if it’s worth keeping around.</p>

<p>logged as watch time?</p>

<p><em>Lebowski</em>. I’m basically throwing 42 minutes out the window.</p>

<p>vogue, would I consider calculating media value by hour like this. What’s a
unit of streaming measurement? An hour? A program? A sitting? I’m only using
hours here to make the math a bit easier, but note that I wouldn’t measure a
disc the same way. If I had rented, say, <em>Schindler’s List</em>, which spans two
discs, I would count that as a single film.</p>

<p>grossly overdue videos. I had to pay it at least twice.</p>
