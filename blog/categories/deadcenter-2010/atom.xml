Beesley editor Lousiana Kreutz’s eleven minute <em>The Bicycle Cowboy</em> doesn’t
just hark back to the feeling of early 20th century American cinema, but
provides for an interesting metaphor about the clash of today’s progressive
movement. We’re first introduced to a cowboy riding along an unseen pathway,
but only revealed from waist up. Traditional cowboy iconography calls to mind
concepts of American honor and duty, yet what the camera reveals is this
cowboy rides upon a bicycle. This addendum to traditional cowboy iconography
implies activism, energy conservation, and anti-capitalism/globalism. These
concepts are usually in constant battle, and what’s so interesting about this
imagery, suggests that our concept of mythic history should contend with an
updated concept of “the West,” one in which activism is just as dominant a
mode of conduct in America as that of any codes of the “western.”  As two
cowboys fight over the control of bikes for the heart of a young woman what
results is a narrative that questions the conventions of aggressive and
competitive resolution. The film ends with a “winner,” as both cowboys come to
realize the young woman has played them against each other. While the
reconfiguration of the American cowboy myth is progressive, what remains a
problem is the inactive female, upon whom the blame remains at the end of the
film (the implied indecisiveness is quite misogynistic). Perhaps any follow up
cycle, as is the nature of American myth/cinema, will address such problems.</p>

<p>In <em>Mr. Hypnotism</em> Brad Beesley’s talent of finding unique individuals is
paired with his abilities to conjure honesty in a document of fiendish
magician Dr. Ronald Dante. The film has a great array of historical footage
and contemporary magic act scenes that reveals less about his day-to-day
manipulation skills and more of his clever wit. And while Ronald Dante is an
amazingly funny character, what’s most interesting is not his entertaining
abilities, but why he’s such great manipulator. The film introduces some
notoriety about his star-adjacent nature, or his faux-university scam, but
what would take these interesting anecdotes to another level is observing
immediate moments where we see how it is Dante manipulates anyone with his
charming personality. <em>Hypnotism</em> feels as though it’s a short dedicated to
revealing the structure of a lengthier piece, who’s reason for abandonment
comes when Dante explicitly acknowledges he was a con man without any mystery.
Yet, Dante’s flat out admission implies something working beyond the moments
captured, beyond his seemingly open interviews to suggest he’s perhaps
manipulated this work to its conclusions so quickly for his own reasons. The
film has successfully made me desire more of the story, more of Dante, and
more of the film’s revelations about humanity, performance, and perhaps our
own masochistic desires to be manipulated.</p>

<p>Salisbury’s capture of the Flaming Lips’s Embyronic album creation methods on
HD reveals not only the more sculpted nature of “improv” (through pronounced
references to Godard’s <em>Sympathy For the Devil</em>), but defines comfort in
exploration. Just as in <em>Sympathy</em>, <em>Blastula: The Making of Embryonic</em> has a
dominant image: a camera that searches for a moment – something yet to be
defined, a strong allegory to the band’s process. While, in <em>Sympathy</em>, such
moments reveal to the audience an ultimate conclusion about the political
metaphor of The Rolling Stones’ “Beggar’s Banquet,” <em>Blastula</em> is less clear
about any such revelation about the Lips’ album Embryonic. Although this is
historically against the nature of The Lips’ representation, the film does
defy this marketing strategy in clearly revealing band members’ identities,
relationships, and thought processes through expository and conventional
talking-head interviews. The strength of this work relies on this
juxtaposition, and provides an entry point to what would otherwise be
seemingly unrelated dolly shots. The excitement of this film does not
necessarily arrive via the nature of wonder and mystery (like it does within
the Lips’ feature <em>Christmas On Mars</em>), but more in the moments of
understanding when achievement does occur – the real resultant joys of
anything improvised are extremely difficult to reveal, and is the real success
of this interesting making-of document.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/heroinhymnstill.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/heroinhymnstill-
300x170.jpg" alt="Still from Heroin Hymn" /></a>While Okie Shorts provided some
great works this year (such as the comedy sketch <em>My Own Prometheus _about
morning coffee and multiple morning identities, or the much talked about faux-
documentary _Faith Healer</em>, who’s documented protagonists leaving a project
reveals less about the film than the metaphor for audience and film-subject
relationship), my interest was in two shorts that made analyses of Oklahoma a
primary part of their structure.</p>

<p>Jerry Melichar’s <em>Landlocked</em> is a confidently executed piece that follows a
Tulsa high-school biology teacher, Martha Hall, who is driven more by her
passion of the aquatic than as an educator. The plot, revolving around a
resentful student’s false accusation about Hall embezzling class trip funds to
a Florida aquatic center, suggests larger political influences. Martha Hall is
trapped within a financial context in which there is no support for
educational engagement for students (something both regionally and nationally
specific), but she is guilty of imposing her desires of escape within this
field trip that conflicts with education’s primary selfless purpose. With
Hall’s apathetic and violent daydreams, the film also suggests that in these
times of educational poverty educators are just as prone to moments of
dangerous explosion as any kids with weapons. The subtext of financial
struggle urges a resolve over complaints of high taxes and problematic budget
allocation that does not result in escapeing the “brain drain” of not just
graduates, but educators. While the film’s ending is satisfactory in Hall’s
eventual escape, it satirically implicates our sympathy as apathy –perhaps the
real reason behind any educational budgetary problem is our own indecision and
inaction, resulting in our criminal complicity with Hall at the end of the
film.</p>

<p>Patrick George’s <em>Heroin Hymn</em> is described as a poetic tale about the
homeless in downtown Oklahoma City, but there is a realism that underlies the
physical context of the narrative that is implicitly critical as much as it is
emotionally sympathetic. We follow a homeless couple who place their disease
of addiction before their own abilities to anticipate safety and needs in a
series of scenes that are quite familiar: panicked cravings, begging and
scheming for drug satisfaction, prostitution, and emotionally unstable
conflicts between addicted partners. While these are situations seen in many
drug pictures, it’s the talents of Kevin Pollard and Andrea Moser that allow
these moments to take on an immediate presence and emotional weight. The
locations of the work also present a keen eye towards describing an Oklahoma
City landscape that is often relegated to more exploitive genre works rather
than the more quiet and contemplative exploration of the hidden imagery of the
city. These sections of the city are “projects” for commercial update, and
George is able to describe the flip side of such development, that of both
dependence and dismissal. These characters are caught between those incoming
classes that begin to enable their habits through sexual or drug transactions,
and the refusal to empower or support them through any assistance supplied by
organizations in these areas. The world drafted in <em>Hymn</em> depicts no
supportive activities, and suggests these necessary needs of transition from
overlooked landscape to a ‘revised’ neighborhood can result in the symptoms of
these characters: isolation, dependence, and ultimately death. The last place
to which these characters can turn are the hidden apartment rooms where deals
go bad, and lost dreams never find their redemption. Although the humanistic
execution of <em>Hymn</em> implies these thoughts, the work could be expanded upon to
balance out the argument, and potentially deepen the power of the piece,
through more explicit scenes that addresses the daily ramifications of
gentrification, commercial redistricting, drug market and the limitations of
local organization support.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/FILM_deadCENTERX.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/FILM_deadCENTERX.jpg" alt="Deadcenter X Logo" /></a>A series of great shorts that
redefine the manner in which “kids work’ is compared with “professional,” one
in which “kid/student” is simply an age level rather than a definition of
cinematic ability of expression or articulation.</p>

<p>Amy Bench’s work <em>In this Place</em> at first glance suggest a rudimentary
application of graphic compositing, as a young woman shifts through background
layouts of bright and exotic locations. We come to learn that Jane, a young
explorer, is simply finding the means of escape from the low contrast, and
more realistically photographed, 35mm footage with her mind’s eye of
exploration in bright HD imagery. While this juxtaposition in itself holds a
fascinating approach towards these two mediums and their relationship with
young filmmakers, it also provides a justification for these compositing
techniques that imply this artifice is of the love and excitement of
imagination. Jane’s boring conversations with her condescending older brothers
further perpetuates her desires for escapism, but when she attempts to develop
her imaginary travels through video distribution, the distributor tells her
the material is unrealistic and overly amateurish. Jane focuses her skills as
a dreamer and video-maker to delight and reconnect her family through a love
video made specifically for them, as she brings them into the emotionally
bright HD footage away from the oppressive and dreary 35mm realism, bridging
the gap between the optimistic visions of youth and falsely-imposed
definitions of cinematic quality.</p>

<p>Temple Tucker’s <em>The Ribbon</em> captures the delicate balance of young
imagination’s existence through thoughtful cinematic composition that relies
on tasteful and tactile imagery as well as contemplative moments of what would
otherwise be an overly internalized world. The young girl, who almost waits
for the departure of her mother to explore the situations in her mind, beckons
for a spark of inspiration that can take her beyond the confines of her
quotidian day-dreams. A fascinating moment finds the young girl performing
shadow puppetry of sword-yielding maidens fighting dinosaurs that ends in a
burning at the stake. Though these moments suggest dark undertones of self-
deprecation and social ostracization, they are important contrasts of
imagination to the beloved pink ribbon that takes her to playgrounds of packed
excitement and possibilities. The complicated depiction of a child’s fears
meshed with their dreams are the result of amazing observation of a child’s
wonder.</p>

<p>Three great and fascinating shorts by young filmmaker Bunee Tomlinson suggest
he is quickly becoming one of Oklahoma’s most prolific and talented young
filmmakers to watch, two of which are not to miss:</p>

<p>His first film, <em>Mom’s Favorite Vase</em> is a unique coming-of-age buddy comedy
of two young preteens whom break a vase while mom is busy in another room.
They spend their day piecing together this vase in hopes of mom overlooking
its ruined stature, only to come to futility. The smartest choices about this
film are it’s clear character building between the audience and these young
boys, whom surprise you with every moment of the expression of frustrations
beyond their years, which further removes them from the day’s playtime to
complete this project in hiding.</p>

<p><em>Without a Doubt</em>, Tomlinson’s next short follows a decision of love-choice
between two suitors: a teenage pen-pal, or current teenage boyfriend. The film
is funny because of its balance of awkward teenage love and a real emotional
underpinning of excited new connections, but it is also amazingly able to
maintain a charm and innocence in every gesture and call for “love” by the
washout pen pal, who’s performance leaves no doubt he firmly believes in
romantic clichés despite the failures of it’s affect.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/the-
terrible-thing-of-alpha-9.jpg"><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/06/the-terrible-thing-of-
alpha-9.jpg" alt="The Terrible Thing of Alpha 9! Still" /></a>While these shorts provide for some great
laughs, it’s the smart choices from intelligent directors that make these
funny moments meaningful and memorable beyond their short duration.</p>

<p>Starting off the comedy block is commercial director Jeremy Berger’s <em>The
Van</em>, which is able to provide some laughter due to it’s confident style and
juxtaposition of Herman Melville’s poetics with a more crass modern humor.
Although the image of a blow-up sex toy is paired with Moby Dick’s narrator
description of his unhindered history of exploits plays on the social comedy
of manners, the film unfortunately hit’s it’s peak. The chase between a biker
messenger and the “white van” that assaults bikers is reliant upon technical
proficiency rather than motivated by the psychological or emotional complexity
of Melville. Perhaps what is lacking is the reason behind the pairing of the
text of Moby Dick within the world of the bike-messenger that would really
take the work into more complicated jokes, and perhaps become a more biting
satire of contemporary eco-business warfare.</p>

<p>Remington Dewan’s <em>The Lemonade Stand</em>, on the other hand, is able to clearly
design the metaphor of young business within a young teenager’s first
neighborhood lemonade stand. What makes Dewan’s film stronger is a protagonist
whose motivations are clear: pseudo-hip business lingo and the addictive game
of profit margins is what excites the young entrepreneur, so much she’s
invited her friend to join her in this excitement. <em>The Lemonade Stand</em> is
thus able to clearly lay out the conflict strongly present in contemporary
comedies like NBC’s <em>The Office</em>, where the successful business is in conflict
with simple humanity.  In the end, the young protagonist confronts the limits
of business, and stands up for her friend when a competing water stand
dismisses the emotions of her friend. Humanity overcomes the shrewd coming of
age business story.</p>

<p><em>Wasting Daylight</em>, the mockumentary of social activists against Daylight
Savings Time is conceptually funny and provides not only the strongest
contender of character humor, but also the strongest performances of the
comedy block. The strength of the short is it’s ability to quickly hone
characters beyond the talking heads format and convey a strong and clear sense
of character and personality, allowing for very successful humor to naturally
spring from clashes of personality types rather than situations or visual
gags. While this short has the strongest character direction, it lingers the
longest. The concept of these personality conflicts is clear, but more
reliance upon the audience to catch on to each character’s personal agenda
could be given, especially due to the strength of Joe Parker’s choices going
into the shooting and his confident handling of back story with the
performers.</p>

<p>Although Oklahoman Terry Holloway’s <em>The Robbery</em> is quick and sweet, it does
take a moment to realize when and what the joke is, but this is what makes the
film’s humor so inventive and funny! With visual homages to the indie
filmmaking of the nineties, this short sketch delivers a situation so
succinctly through carefully crafted physical gags and jokes, because of its
short duration it’s easy to dismiss the maturity of these decisions. The cues
and pace of the film direct my attention so clearly, I am not only able to
understand and empathize with a character that is so quickly introduced, but
I’m also able to anticipate the character’s actions in such limited amounts of
time that the moment the actions occur it’s as if I’ve willed the character to
do my bidding –and thus my participation in the joke makes for the unique and
clever comedy that reminds me of Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton.</p>

<p>The sweetest comedy, also playing in the Animation block of shorts, is <em>The
Terrible Thing of Alpha 9!</em> from <em>Ugly Americans</em>/<em>Superjail</em> animator Jake
Armstrong. While the animation’s design is hip and beautiful, it’s the
implicit commentary against “invade and conquer” that allows for a surprising
subtly in emotion when an alien monster with a reputation of evil turns out to
be as loving and loyal as a puppy. While the moment of the alien headhunter’s
violent death treads distasteful waters (its execution could be seen as
playing up the violence for drama and joke), it is the alien monster’s despair
at the loss of this life that lifts this cartoon violence into bittersweet
pity.</p>

    <id>http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/06/11/deadcenter-x-review-1-in-3-domestic-violence-advocacy-in-action</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com
/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/20651_296145263820_296129823820_3400990_6766818_n.

96145263820_296129823820_3400990_6766818_n.jpg" alt="1 in 3 Still" /></a>Lagueria Davis’ <em>1 in 3</em> is not so much a depiction of <em>Lifetime</em>-
melodrama nor the exploitive horrors that are common in domestic abuse
thrillers, but a more realistic drafting of the possibilities of subtle daily
domestic violence. As a first feature, <em>1 in 3</em> is prone to raw craft, but it
is the passion and careful intention of the film’s depiction of fear in
domestic violence that allows the film to convey its message of strength and
validate social advocacy.</p>

<p>An initial courtroom scene between Sydell, social service advocate, and her
domestic violence client Angie defines several key concepts behind the film.
As the judge hears another case, Sydell and Angie share a private dialogue
through the passing of paper and pen. What Angie reveals is a fear of her
abusive husband despite the safety of legal decisions. Though she may
recognize the authority of the legal procedures, the fact remains that Angie’s
voice is denied and the ramifications of this moment extend beyond the
courtroom of rules. Angie’s husband not only proves the limits of legal
restrictions when he pulls out a gun in a later scene, but also ignites the
recognition of the realities behind Sydell’s job: a legal resolution does not
stop the possibilities of violence, and perhaps forces an unintended silence
of victims. While this sequence of events results in dramatic violence at the
hands of a male aggressor and gunplay, the film reveals the forms of violence
only begin with the physical and extend into one’s own complicity when fears
become the driving force of daily decisions.</p>

<p>Sydell and Angie are two of three women the film follows, and upper-class
married Ophelia is the third. While Sydell confronts issues with intelligent
contemplation and smart retort, Ophelia is a character of action. Battle
preparations of hidden car keys and pill bottles anticipate her husband’s
violent outbursts, just as they also reveal her acceptance of this violence as
habit. Natasha Barron’s articulate performance of subtle gesture and hidden
thought provide a believable character who’s torn between the love of her
family and the painful relationship she’s had to endure. While it is Barron’s
command as an actress that allows for a believable confrontation between the
two strong characters Ophelia and Sydell, Davis has not drafted enough scenes
of Ophelia’s struggle between the love for a husband when he is good and the
horror of an abuser when he is bad. Such scenes would heighten and clarify the
reasons behind the difficulty of leaving a spouse, especially if they are an
abuser.</p>

<p>All shortcomings aside, the strength of the film is how Davis conveys the
complicity that one’s own fear plays in the role of victim in any problematic
relationship. While Sydell does not have a history of domestic violence, she
is able to strongly advocate for the validity of a victim’s emotions as well
as support their acceptance of violence in their own lives – both key
necessities of domestic violence advocates. Though Sydell is strong in her
beliefs, only once Ophelia questions her authority in group therapy does
Sydell appear to be hypocritical. Sydell’s own fears inhibit her decision
making process when it comes to letting her guard down when finding a mate. As
Sydell comes to recognize her internalization of fear has blocked her ability
to find happiness, the viewer is able to identify Sydell as struggling with
the same inhibitions Ophelia does when asked to verbally recognize her own
abuse. These two women suddenly share a similar struggle of fear’s powerful
grasp over one’s identity, and close the bridge between Ophelia’s question of
authority and Sydell’s limited domestic violence memory. This conflicted
depiction of Sydell breaks down the often either/or cinematic depiction of the
social worker as an overly emotional bleeding heart or the cold-hearted lover
of government red-tape. This bridge between Sydell and Ophelia should
hopefully instill a comfort for those victims who question the sympathy of
their advocates, suggesting they too are overtaken by the fragile nature of
one’s fear and guilt.</p>
