    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>YouTube announced in December that it logged 1 trillion hits in 2011 and is anticipating an even bigger year ahead as more politicians and newsmakers turn to the site to distribute Web ads, speeches and weekly video casts. On Thursday, Kyncl said all of the entertainment industry should be paying attention to Web video, predicting that soon 90 percent of Web traffic will be video.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>If the Internet were a pizza, there’d only be half of a half of a slice with the oil dabbed off reserved for people who don’t watch video.</p>

<p>We should probably take this video thing seriously.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This just doesn’t make any sense:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>On the morning of Jan. 11, 2002, Mary Lea Bandy, chief curator of the MoMA Department of Film and Video, told the two Stills Archive staff members that at the end of the business day two things would happen: the facility would be shuttered and the staffers would be laid off—until, and unless, the Museum found space for the Stills Archive when MoMA returned from its temporary home in Queens to an enlarged Manhattan premises in 2005. The collection was mothballed in the Film Department’s vault in Hamlin, Pa., where it remains today, inaccessible to scholars and journalists, and to the head of the Archive, Mary Corliss.</p><footer><strong>-Richard Corliss</strong> <cite><a href='http://entertainment.time.com/2012/01/11/mary-and-moma-the-case-of-the-still-missing-film-stills/?iid=ent-main-lede'>TIME.com</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>Thursday July 19 midnight shows for The Dark Knight Rises: The IMAX Experience have already sold out at New York’s AMC Loews Lincoln Square theater. The AMC Loews Universal City cineplex in Los Angeles has sold out all seats and all but two wheelchair slots, according to seating charts for advance sales via Fandango.</p><footer><strong>The Deadline Team</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/opening-night-imax-versions-of-the-dark-knight-rises-already-sold-out-in-nyc-la/'>Deadline.com</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>That’s the only true IMAX in New York City. I’m not a huge Nolan/Knight nerd, but I am a sucker for the only innovation happening in celluloid these days (i.e. IMAX’s 70mm acquisition and projection). Maybe they’ll add a 3 a.m. showing.</p>
