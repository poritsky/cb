    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The voting is over and the results are in: for the first time in 65 years the
Academy Awards has ten films contending for the Best Picture statue. Wow,
that’s twice as many movies as before; how can we make sense of all of them.
Of course you should see all ten films and make an informed decision, or just
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2010/02/02/guide-to-the-2010-oscar-
nominees/">read what the candler blog has to say about
them</a>. In the meantime we’ve parsed a bit of data and laid it out for you
in colorful glory. I’ll let the graphic speak for itself, so take a peek.</p>

<p>That’s a lot to take in at once. No matter how much data we can look at, from
a film’s gross to Academy voters’ tendencies, the truth is that most voters
work hard to inform themselves and make the decisions they feel are right in
their hearts. We’ve got a whole month of speculation ahead of us, but feel
free to leave your gut reactions in the comments. Happy Awards Season.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The candler blog was born in March of 2009. In the past year, we’ve written a
whole lot about cinema, and I’m proud to say we’ve covered most of the top
2010 Oscar contenders on these pages. We even had a strong opinion <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/07/02/rules-ampas-should-change-besides-
best-pic-slots/">back when
AMPAS upped the number of Best Picture nominations to
10</a>. There are still some holes and we’ll fix that soon. For now,
catch up on our thoughts on the year’s biggest films and share your what you
