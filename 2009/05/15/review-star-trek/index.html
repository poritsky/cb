<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/apr2009/8/0/star-trek-the-new-crew-pic-
rex-sm-119862879.jpg" alt="" />“Live long and prosper” is the least that one could say
about the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise. Over four decades have passed since the first
incarnation of Gene Roddenberry’s brainchild. The original series, known for
it’s cheese and moral pomp, ran a mere three seasons, but nonetheless inspired
eleven movies, five television series, countless books, toys, videogames and,
above all, generations of space enthusaists and geeks. Daunting, then, is the
task of re-introducing the classic characters onto the big screen. Thankfully,
director and television impresario J.J. Abrams rises to the occasion to make
<em>Star Trek</em> (it’s actually the first film to bear that name alone) not only a
welcome addition, but an inspired thrill-ride which really kicks summer 2009
into gear.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/05/08/review-x-men-origins-
wolverine/">some other 2009
blockbuster</a>, screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have crafted a
legitimate origin story for the franchise. The film opens with Captain Kirk
and Mr. Spock as children on their respective planets showing a distinct
promise of greatness. Over the years, the Star Trek galaxy has become so vast
that the characters within it seem to have shrunk in stature, considered more
to be model citizens of the Federation than anything more. By focusing on the
early years of these two shipmates, Mr. Abrams is emphasizing that Kirk, Spock
and their cohorts are not the norm; they are extraordinary; they are
superheroes.</p>

<p>Any remake (rehash or reboot, whichever you prefer) suffers from comparison to
its forebears, but Mr. Abrams and friends have found the perfect plot to
circumvent continued scrutiny, opening up poetic leeway for the assumed
sequels to come. The plot is simple yet elegant, laid out in a perfect linear
manner. As I said before, this is a true origin story, and all of the hero
story beats hit on every mark. The added fun here is that our two main
characters, Spock and Kirk, antiphonally fill the shoes of student and teacher
for each other. This push and pull of one hero against another is not only
fascinating, it’s great fun to watch.</p>

<p>Chris Pine slips nicely into the captain’s chair as James T. Kirk, the role
that made William Shatner a household name. Ditching the Shat’s signature
pentameter, Mr. Pine retains the attitude of the original of the character
without delving into impersonation. Confident, skilled, smug and dead sexy,
this is the Kirk we have all known for so long but in a more youthful body.
Similarly, Zachary Quinto dons the pointy ears of Mr. Spock, but imbues the
character with his own brand of emotional sophistication. He feels a little
more relatable than Leonard Nimoy was in the same role, I want to say more
human. This is a wonderful progression for Spock and I can’t wait to see where
Mr. Quinto takes this.</p>

<p>The other performances are what some would call impersonation, but what I
would call skilled homage. My personal favorite is Karl Urban as Leonard
“Bones” McCoy. Mr. Urban pulls off a perfect young DeForest Kelley, who played
the role originally; he offers up that recognizable gruffness while
introducing his own bright-eyed views of space travel. The same goes for
British funnyman Simon Pegg as Montgomery Scott, or Scotty. While his
resemblance to a young James Doohan is not as noticeable, he does reprise the
signature wit and charm of the Scotch engineer.</p>

<p>Also, Bruce Greenwood broods as the aging Captiain Christopher Pike and Anton
Yelchin provides some xenophobic laughs as Pavel Chekov. The only egregious
misstep is the role of Lieutenant Uhura, in which Zoë Saldana does her best to
hold her own as the lone woman on the bridge but can’t quite rise above her
designation as eye-candy. It is unfortunate that a series so dedicated to a
unified Earth still relies on things like Chekov’s pronounciation of the
letter “V” or Uhura’s sex appeal to keep people grounded. Ms. Saldana is
certainly the loser here, because while we get to see Chekov’s technical
acumen and heart of gold on display, all we really see of Uhura is her thighs.</p>

<p>Visually we are offered inspired eyefuls from the first frame to the last. The
special effects are a wonder and the action scenes are enthralling,
particularly a duel featuring Mr. Sulu coming out of his intellectual shell.
The cinematography itself is fine, but I wonder about the extensive use of
lens flair throughout. On one level, it enhances many shots by adding an extra
layer of information to the frame. Still, it seems to take away more than it
adds and serves no emotional purpose as it did in Paul Thomas Anderson’s
<em>Punch Drunk Love</em>. Director of photography Dan Mindel may not pull in any
awards for this film, but he sure as hell can make an action scene come
together with incredible flair (no pun intended). I’d be remiss if I didn’t
mention Michael Giacchino’s appropriately bombastic score, which elevates so
many key moments of the film, including the opening title, to the kind of
heart-pounding experience that makes you want to jump out of your seat and
cheer.</p>

<p>J.J. Abrams is known for his compelling mystery work (you can read what he
thinks on the subject <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-05/mf_jjessay">here
</a>and listen to
his thoughts
<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/j_j_abrams_mystery_box.html">here</a>). In
the past decade he has captivated a nation with his multiple twisted
television series, but this is only his second feature as director. How
appropriate then, that one of our most prolific television writers helm a
cinematic adaptation of one of our most beloved skeins. Infamously approaching
the project as a non-Trekkie, Mr. Abrams cut through the fandom and lore in an
effort to find the human (and Vulcan…you know what I mean) story at the
core. This year’s <em>Star Trek</em> holds its own not only against the rest of the
franchise but against all other competitions. I find it hard to believe that
you have more fun at any other movie this summer, but it’s only mid-May.
Here’s to a great start to summer 2009.</p>
