<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/05/sam-worthington-and-christian-bale-terminator-
salvation-2jpg.jpeg" alt="Terminator Salvation Still" />If you have never seen another <em>Terminator</em> film, the
franchise’s latest installment, <em>Terminator Salvation</em>, will be utterly
baffling to you. The good news is that if you’re a fanboy well-versed in the
series’ robotic lore, you’ll leave the theater just as confused and
dissatisified as all the noobs. In other words, it is an equal opportunity
snoozer replete with lumbering action sequences, misplaced character
development and an unrealized love subplot. Ahhh, summer.</p>

<p>The film opens in a jail cell in 2003 as Marcus Wright, played by a dialect-
confused Sam Worthington, signs his body over to Cyberdyne systems before his
lethal injection. Flash forward a decade and a half and we find the world in
ruins after the internet-induced nuclear holocaust we know of from the
previous film, <em>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</em>. Whatever humans are left
spend their time fighting robots, which are just angry, steely machines; not
quite the androids we have come to know over the years. John Connor, whose
performance is phoned in by a grizzled Christian Bale, now holds some form of
prophetic role in the world as a radio preacher.</p>

<p>Anyway, Connor goes on a mission that ends in stuff getting blow’d up, awaking
the now robotic Marcus in a goofy Golem/Frankenstein homage. After some more
robot action and the appearance of the requisite babe (who is tough enough to
fly a fighter jet yet still needs a man/machine to protect her from rape-
hungry miscreants), we learn that Kyle Reese, who is actually John Connor’s
father, has been taken to Skynet’s headquarters. As the resistance is planning
an attack, Reese is sure to die at the hands of either robot or human, unless
John Connor and his android buddy have anything to say about it. Campy schlock
ensues.</p>

<p>The question shouldn’t be “where does this film go wrong?” as much as it
should be “where does it go right?”. I’ll offer up the one highlight as Anton
Yelchin’s performance as Kyle Reese. Just as Ewan McGregor channeled a young
Alec Guiness to play Obi-Wan Kenobi, so too does Mr. Yelchin embody a young
Michael Biehn who created the role 25 years ago. Adding some lovable humor to
this year’s <em>Star Trek</em> and now giving us the only character worth watching in
<em>Salvation</em>, this is turning out to be the summer of Yelchin, and let’s hope
there are many more to come.</p>

<p>Other than that, the film is a mess. The action sequences are yawn-able, the
motivations of neither the machines nor the humans make any no sense, and
worst of all, we are offered no insight into John Connor’s destiny. As the
lore goes, he is the key to ending the war with the machines, which he already
did, preemptively, in the second film. We last saw him stuck in a bunker at
the end of the third film, yet this film completely skips what happens after
that. How does he get out and rise up through the ranks? Why do people think
he is a prophet? Did he tell them? No answers are offered here, making this
feel more like mid-season filler for a television show rather than the
gratification we expect from a season finale.</p>

<p>McG, the film’s director, is someone I had hoped would have graduated from a
successful run as an adolescent filmmaker. Unfortunately, his attempts at
growing up falter on every front. This film tries to show us a gritty future,
but the picture is so incredibly clean that this barely comes off. It feels
like an effected car commercial instead of a bleak view of the future. On top
of that, save for Mr. Yelchin, no one offers up a memorable performance,
leading me to believe that McG has incredibly low expectations of his actors.
He gets work because he knows how to blow stuff up, but even the action is
tired. Spatially almost nothing makes sense and there are no intense moments.
I kept thinking of how great it was in the original film when the T-800 busts
into the police station to get Sarah Connor. That scene, pretty bare bones
special effects wise, works because by that point the audience is braced and
excited for the ensuing gun battle. No scene is ever to pulse pounding in this
film. I’m not sure that McG will ever get better, so maybe the franchise
should find someone else.</p>

<p>This is the first film not to feature Arnold Schwazzenegger, at least not in
the flesh. A more important absence here, however, is James Cameron, whose
name doesn’t appear in the credits at all, a Terminator first. This seems
fitting as this is the least interesting and least innovative film of the
bunch. <em>Rise of the Machines</em> at least offered up a wicked car chase. It is
nice to see this beloved and respected story continue, but if this is
direction things are going, then we have to say “Hasta La Vista, Baby”.</p>
