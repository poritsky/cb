<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.filmofilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/angels-and-demons-
113_m.jpg" alt="" />If you were wondering how oscar winning director Ron Howard spends
his weekends, you will find the answer in his latest film, <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em>,
which appears to have been conceived and produced in his spare time. Cobbled
together from a thin plot by pulp sensationalist Dan Brown’s novel of the same
name, the story follows Harvard symbologist (semiologist, no?) Robert Langdon
on a winding mystery through the annals of Vatican history. While the material
is fascinating, the film suffers mostly from whiplash, trying desperately to
keep your attention on the winding streets of Rome but forgetting to build any
kind of relationship with the players involved.</p>

<p>After the kidnapping of the four cardinals favored to replace the recently
deceased pope, Mr. Langdon, played by an unusually stolid Tom Hanks, is called
to the Vatican to consult for the Church, who believes the Illuminati, a cabal
of scientists and scholars supposedly killed off in the 17th century, have
returned for vengeance. Upon arrival, he meets Vittoria Vetra, a sultry
physicist thesped by the wondrous Ayelet Zurer. She was called in when
antimatter stolen from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva turns up
hidden somewhere in Vatican City. Suspended between two magnets in a battery
powered canister, the mysterious antimatter will ignite should it lose power,
which will happen at the convenient stroke of midnight.</p>

<p>All characters in place, Langdon immediately bites on one of the clues offered
up by the kidnapper/terrorist and off we go. Bouncing around from church to
church with brief spates in the Vatican archives, the film gets old very fast.
Much of this has to do with the character of Robert Langdon, a milquetoast
academic who never even surrenders to the gods of logic, instead buying into
anti-Christian dogma religiously, ironically. He has no skin in the game, to
put it more bluntly. There are lives on the line so he must participate, but
since he has no reveal, no emotional discord to be resolved, he becomes less
of a protagonist and more a vehicle to get us from point to point, murder to
murder, and to Mr. Brown’s semiotic agenda.</p>

<p>Along the way we meet Patrick McKenna, the emotinally invested Camerlengo
charged with administering the Pope’s office until a new one is elected.
Filling the sub-papal shoes is Ewan McGregor, this time sporting an Irish
accent and an innocent sneer to boot. His foil is the aging Cardinal Strauss,
who is charged with leading the conclave to elect the new pope. Strauss,
played with dependable efficacy by Armin Mueller-Stahl, represents the
unbending faith of the deeply codified organization, while McKenna is
something of a wide-eyed revolutionary, seemingly rewriting church law in an
effort to save the lives of both the endangered priests and the public at
large. While both are fine actors in their own regard, neither McGregor nor
Mueller-Stahl is given a hook on which to hang a performance, a running theme
in this movie.</p>

<p>The film isn’t without its high points, particularly at the Large Hadron
Collider at the beginning. Geeks around the world will be impressed by the
footage taken from within the actual particle accelerator. The filmmakers go
above and beyond to make the process of smashing protons together, which is
yet to be tested at CERN’s massive Swiss facility, both scientifically
plausible and visually exhillerating. Sadly, the real science ends once the
antimatter is stolen. For the duration of the film, it is nothing more than a
huge bomb. The truth is that while we have no idea what would happen if
antimatter and matter came in contact with one another, the general consensus
is that it would be freaking scary, like destroy the universe scary. It is not
this scientific inaccuracy that is so annoying but the unwillingness to
explore this most interesting boundary of both science and religion.</p>

<p>In the end, this is a mystery with religious iconography as an overarching
MacGuffin. So much time is spent orienting the audience that there is hardly
any chance to slow down and make sense of the dastardly plot. Writers David
Koepp and Akiva Goldsman are no slouches, but they have composed a wooden
script this time out. Perhaps they are not to blame; maybe not Ron Howard
either. Dan Brown’s novels are unabashed pulp shlock while these film
adaptations are approached with misguided reverence for the originals. Perhaps
the further from Mr. Brown these stories get, and they are phenomenal tales,
the better they will be. We’ll just have to wait and see when his next novel,
The Lost Symbol, slated for the supposed largest first printing in Random
House history, hits shelves this fall and inevitably, theaters in a few years.</p>
