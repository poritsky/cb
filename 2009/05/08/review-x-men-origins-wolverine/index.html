<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.pjlighthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10
/wolverine-marvel-huge-jackman.jpg"><img src="http://www.pjlighthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/wolverine-marvel-
huge-jackman.jpg" alt="" /></a>Sitting down to consider an entire series
of X-Men (X-People?) Origins films, I am reminded of Chaucer, the Middle
English scribe whose death kept him from completing nearly 100 promised
stories in <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>. With any luck, I’ll be long dead before
anyone tries to make another installment in this franchise with the same
foolhardy bravado that director Gavin Hood and his team have brought to <em>X-Men
Origins: Wolverine</em>.</p>

<p>The film opens with a hint of promise in northwestern Canada in 1845. A sickly
young James Logan, who is to become our Wolverine, accidentally kills his
biological father (who had just killed his adopted father!) with his newly
discovered retractable bone claws and runs off to the woods. There, another
boy, Victor, who we just learned is in fact James’s brother, is waiting. They
run off together, promising never to separate and to never go back.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Victor is a mutant just like James. He will grow up to become
who X-heads will recognize as Sabretooth, though filmgoers will never know
that as he is never bestowed a fabulous nom de guerre as our hunky Logan is
(Wolverine, rawr). Since their main power is the ability to cheat death, they
live on through history, though oddly, United States history. For whatever
reason, these two mutant Canucks fight in every major U.S. war of the last two
centuries. This confusion is compounded by the question: if they are immortal,
why did they choose to stay thirty-five forever? Normally I might gloss over
these niggles, but this is an origin story after all; these are the questions
we need answers to.</p>

<p>Their extreme abilities are noticed by a William Stryker, who invites them to
an elite unit of mutant soldiers. On a special ops mission in “Africa”
(geeeeezus can’t you be more specific?), Logan backs down when things get too
ugly, what with the killing and torture of civilians and all. This pits him
against his bloodthirsty brother, setting off a thin plotline which doesn’t
warrant much explanation. From the get go, our feisty protag believes in the
powers of good. This, among all the other noise and confusion, is the real
problem with this film.</p>

<p>Origin stories are as old as oral storytelling and they have remianed
consistenly unchanged. Ultimately, an origin relies not on the acquisition of
power or skill, but rather on the choosing to work toward either good or evil.
Off the bat, Logan is a good guy, stopping his megalomaniac brother from
succumbing to evil within the first fifteen minutes of the film. Why is he so
righteous? This is the one question we needed answered but were denied.</p>

<p>To switch off the cerebral deconstruction of the film, I should mention that
the action scenes are wholly unappealing. For one, the effects look
ludicrously fake, particularly a heavy reliance on green-screened backgrounds.
This is the stuff of made for TV movies and it’s insulting to think that
audience’s would stand for it. This film is a surefire hit considering the
X-Men branding, why not throw a bit of cash into some actual locations?</p>

<p>As for Mr. Hood, whose <em>Tsosti</em> won best foreign language film at the 2006
Oscars, I don’t know that blame for this schlocky film should rest entirely on
his shoulders. He is not the first independant director thrust into the fold
of a messy studio blockbuster which nearly swallows him whole. Antoine Fuqua
(whose <em>Training Day</em> nabbed Denzel Washington his first best actor Oscar) is
another filmmaker who was nearly shuffled into obscurity after his disastrous
2004 actioner, <em>King Arthur</em>.</p>

<p>Ever since the success of <em>Spiderman</em>, with niche horror director Sam Raimi at
the helm, Hollywood has been seeking out fringe directors for their biggest
projects. In many cases, such as in the choice of Alfonso Cuarón (a foreign
film oscar nominee) to direct <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>,
which resulted in, at least in this critic’s opinion, the most beautiful and
moving pic in the franchise. Mr. Hood did not prove as adept at honing his
skills for a film of this size. This film is clunky at best, cheesy at worst.
It feels almost as if no one is driving this caravan, which is where Gavin
Hood, who may one day become a great director, has failed us.</p>

<p>As I’m sure you know, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was illegally distributed on
the internet a month ago. The cause of that leak is still unknown, at least
publicly, but it fits in line with the overall problem with this film: no one
is home at the top. The story lumbers along with very little holding it
together. Perhaps the leak was an accident, committed by one of the many
people involved on this film who were obviously looking the other way as it
completely fell apart.</p>
