<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Adventurland</em> is the story of James Brennan, a recent college graduate with a
noggin full of impeccable vocabulary and lofty esotericisms. When his father
takes a pay cut at work, his trip to Europe is called off and his fall plans
for grad school are put in jeopardy, leading him to a summer job at the local
theme park whose name is the film’s title. There, of course, he falls in love,
learns more about himself, and meets all kinds of wacky characters along the
way in this refined coming of age comedy.</p>

<p>Setting aside (most of) the raunch and raucousness of 2007’s <em>Superbad</em>,
writer/director Greg Mottola offers us a view of young adults that has become
frighteningly rare in Hollywood. Grounded yet hopeful, with limited but
sufficient resources, James and his love interest, Em, are relatable and
realistic twenty-somethings, not overly ironic Napoleon Dynamites or vacuous
shells like those found on NBC’s failed <em>Quarterlife</em> (does anyone even
remember that show?). It’s hard to describe their trials without giving away
much of the film’s draw, so let’s mostly take a look at the who instead of the
what.</p>

<p>Jesse Eisenberg, who plays James, has a real talent for comedic dialogue. He
delivers Mr. Mottola’s high-brow verbiage in a very plain spoken manner that,
instead of boring us, makes sense of the wordsmith’s dizzying work. Mr.
Eisenberg is basically picking up where Michael Cera ends. Both can do deadpan
and do it well, but in <em>Adventurland</em>, Eisenberg breaks through that stolid
mold to reveal James’s deeper conflict without ever letting up the Stan Laurel
act.</p>

<p>The real hidden gem in the film is Kristen Stewart as Em. Unlike James, who at
least had a life plan before his hopes were dashed, Em is still in college and
going through a tortured identiy crisis. All ot once, Ms. Stewart is a bubbly
townie, sophisticated undergrad, titlating seductress, and confused woman-
child. These traits come out in waves throughout the plot, but the young
actress manages to bring all of them to the forefront in every frame,
underscoring how complex the formative years of Em’s adult life are.</p>

<p>SNL centerpieces Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig appear sporadically not only for
extra padding in the laughter department but also as the only successful
relationship in the film. As much as James and Em dream to become more than
Bobby and Pauline (Hader and Wiig) who own the theme park, it is obvious that
their love and partnership is the only example they can look up to. For
philosophical exposition, we have Joel played by Martin Starr, whose wisdom is
equaled only by his geekiness. Mr. Starr is somewhat bringing the same weird-
kids-are-people-too charm he had on_ Freaks and Geeks_, and it is quite
welcome here.</p>

<p>Technically, the film makes a great deal out of very little, particularly in
the editing department. It is obvious that there were holes plugged up in the
editing phase of this film, but we never feel like editor Anne McCabe and her
team settled. Instead they pulled from a bag of tricks, namely re-recording
audio over wide shots (this is all conjecture, but a trained eye will notice
these things). Cinematographer Terry Stacey crafts some striking visuals,
particularly in scenes that occur near a bridge that remind me of a common
shot in many Woody Allen films, famously <em>Manhattan</em>.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, the film is sprinkled with wonderful nuance, such as
James’s father’s implied alcoholism or Em’s father’s philandering at
synagogue, of all places. This is not just a coming of age film in that this
isn’t only interesting to people who are coming of age. This is an amazingly
mature, layered piece that takes the form of a post-teen revelatory tale. <a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/2007/08/22/review-
superbad/">I
was personally pissed off</a> when everyone glossed over Mr. Mottola’s efforts on <em>Superbad</em>
(instead crediting the Judd Apatow cabal), so it is really nice to see him
come into his own on this film. It has been a long time coming, but this
should cement his place as a sought after talent, and we, as viewers, will be
the benefactors for years to come.</p>
