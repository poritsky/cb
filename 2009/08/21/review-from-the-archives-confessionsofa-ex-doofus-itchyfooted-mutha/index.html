<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Apparently, Melvin Van Peebles’s _Confessionsofa Ex-Doofus ItchyFooted Mutha</em>
is opening this weekend at <a href="http://www.cinemavillage.com/chc/cv/show_movie.asp?movieid=1642">Cinema Village in
NYC</a>. I
caught the flick at Tribeca 2008 and, oh, what a scene it was. Originally
posted on the official <a href="http://poritsky.com/blog/2008/05/03/tribeca-2008-confessionsofa-ex-
doofus-itchyfooted-mutha/">Poritsky
Blog</a>, here is my original review/gut-reaction of this,
shall we say, interesting film._</p>

<h4 id="melvin-van-peebles-after-the-premiere-of-his-2008-film-confessionsofa">-Melvin Van Peebles, after the premiere of his 2008 film “Confessionsofa</h4>
<p>Ex-Doofus Itchy-Footed Mutha”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I was sitting in a university auditorium that I was
suddenly rocketed back to my film school days while watching the latest film
“of” Melvin Van Peebles. Back then, I would have been sniggering through my
fingers as the raucous movie veered out of control around every single corner,
and when it was all over and the lights went up, I would have over-analyzed
the shit out of it and blatantly made fun of my colleague in class.</p>

<p>On its surface, “Confessionsofa Ex-Doofus-Itchyfooted Mutha” resembles the
worst of student film stereotypes, replete with sex, knives, confused editing
techniques, and above all, a message that it so convoluted and overdone that
it has gotten lost among the screen-pollution you witness while watching it.
That being said, I’m trying to figure out just why I loved this film.</p>

<p>The story goes like this. Mr. Van Peebles plays the lead role, one can never
quite grasp his name, as an old man coming to terms with his life. He sits
down in a dark and smoky room and begins his tale of woe for the captive
audience. The rest is the story of his life told through flashbacks. His
career in the merchant marine, his business venture with an addle-brained
cohort, his first and only love, his journey to find solace in the heart of
Africa and his subsequent escape from civil war there. All star the 75 year-
old Van Peebles at varying stages of life, and all seem to take place in the
same era, the current day. For example, you might see the elder filmmaker at
school talking to other kids, or running away from home with a tin of money he
had saved since he was born. No effort is made to dress up the sets to feel as
though they are in a particular period.</p>

<p>While it might help focus the audience if we could have a coherent picture of
this man’s history, Mr. Van Peebles’s formal choices, or lack thereof, help
drive his character home for us. In other words, to be distracted by the logic
that we do not see in this film is foolish. We receive just a clear a picture
of our leading man’s life with all the silliness of watching an old man act
like a child. It is clear who he is and why he has lived his life the way he
has. On top of all of that, as should be clear from the title, he is not a
trustworthy narrator. It is conceivable that his tales of intrigue and sexual
conquest are but a fabrication created to make it easier for him to sleep at
night.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ve yet made you aware of how silly this movie gets. Here are
some bullet points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While in the merchant marine, Mr. Van Peebles’s ship captain blows up a rival pirate ship (whose captain is played by the director’s son, Mario Van Peebles) and our hero is showered in gore. Grabbing arms as they land on him, he scratches his back and his crotch with the expected sound effects</li>
  <li>On the same voyage, he spends his leave time seducing little old ladies, making love to them and using their checkbooks</li>
  <li>In an effort to escape the clutches of a dictator in Africa, he runs through the jungle and is encountered by a randy gorilla, whose clutches he narrowly escapes only by pulling on its privates.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also expect the film to quickly rush into trippy effects around almost
every corner. The picture changes color constantly, there are countless image
overlays, and cartoon sound effects are used to hilarious effect throughout.
However, this just adds to the charm of the piece. We have become far too hung
up on plot in our cinema, so it is nice to see such an interesting (to say the
least!) character study.</p>

<p>When the book is closed on Melvin Van Peebles, he will unquestionably be
remembered by his 1971 independent hit “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song”.
Though he had made higher profile films before that one and has made quite a
few since, it is the film that is synonymous with his name and considered the
progenitor of the blaxploitation film movement. The incendiary film broke down
barriers and opened up opportunities for generations of black filmmakers.
Since the 1970s, however, this scruffy suspendered visionary has pulled back
from the mainstream. Left to his own devices, he has been making the films he
wants to make, for him. One must respect his audacity. If this film ever makes
it to DVD, I highly recommend you add it to your queue.</p>
