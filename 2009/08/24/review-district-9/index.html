<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.horrorphile.net/images/district-9-sharlto-copley1.jpg" alt="" />Though
Neill Blomkamp’s <em>District 9</em> evokes many of the classical elements of science
fiction films, the movie that kept coming back to me as I sat through the
disturbingly realistic pic was Melvin Van Peebles’ <em>Watermelon Man.</em> That 1970
film, which depicts a white racist waking up one day as a black man, hides a
poignant and timely message beneath the glimmering facade of a Hollywood
comedy. In much the same way, Mr. Blomkamp relies on familiar sci-fi
conventions to get to his many-layered message: if we are not alone in the
universe, do we deserve to know who shares it with us?</p>

<p>In an age when digital wizardry has opened up the floodgates to science-
fiction pics of all shapes and sizes, the genre seems to have become reliant
on the overall wow-factor, each film attempting to out-do the other in terms
of creature screentime. I remember a time when films would advertise how many
minutes more of digital special effects they had than <em>Jurassic Park</em>. (Brad
Silberling’s 1995 <em>Casper</em>, as in the friendly ghost, was particularly fond of
this statistic.) The main casualty of this shift has been the presence of a
theme and a message. Enter <em>District 9</em>.</p>

<p>Multi-National United (MNU) is a ubiquitous corporation charged with managing
the transfer of an alien race known as “prawns” from the makeshift “district
9” to the better controlled area known as “district 10”. Having landed for no
known reason two decades ago over Johannesburg, the prawns have become one of
the most marginalized group of refugees on the planet. MNU appears to be
taking on the impossible by dealing with the safe passage of the prawns, but
as you may have guessed, their intentions aren’t quite so pure. They are
aliens and they have huge freaking weapons which are linked to their DNA, only
a prawn can fire them. For twenty years, MNU has been trying to get a human to
fire one of these things. Their opportunity comes when Wikus Van De Merwe, a
high-level grunt at MNU, accidentally sprays space-goop in his face and grows
a prawn arm.</p>

<p>Wikus is a decidedly interesting character. He is a pencil pushing kook who
steals our hearts even when he is at his most fascist. His wide-eyed
explanations of prawn “population control”, in which a house full of fifty
eggs is torched while babies scream and pop, is absolutely endearing. With a
lump in your throat, there will still probably be a smile on your face. Just
like Jeff Gerber in <em>Watermelon Man</em>, before the accident he is a racist on
the extreme end of the spectrum, yet he displays such lively humanity that we
can only shake our heads in disappointment. The proper reaction should be to
grab a tire-iron and beat the shit out of him.</p>

<p>As his prawnification accelerates, MNU opts to vivisect Wikus in the name of
science, but he escapes to district 9 and meets one of the smarter prawns who
promises a way to turn him human again. Begin chase film. Stuff blows up and
stories get resolved; it’d be better if you just saw the movie than to explain
it all. In the end, you will probably have a bad tasted in your mouth. What is
so disturbing about <em>District 9</em> is that it is highly conceivable that
everything that occurs in the film would transpire given the opportunity. How
do we know? Because we have been doing this to our own kind for thousands of
years.</p>

<p>Johannesburg is the setting for the film, and I don’t care how many times Mr.
Blomkamp says this film isn’t about apartheid, it is. If they landed over
Portland, Oregon the narrative would be completely different. While <em>District
9</em> is a story about human shortcomings, not specifically South African, the
time and place of the film are decidedly significant. For one, the alien race
landed while apartheid was still an issue, perhaps their presence brought both
sides together against them. For most of the world, there is a question as to
what apartheid actually is. In essence, it is the marginalization and
dehumanization of an entire race of people. It goes a great deal deeper than
acts of violence or forcing someone to the back of a bus (not to minimize
American civil rights by any means). It is racism as policy, as a matter of
popular belief that seeps into every corner of society. We learn with Wikus
how deep that marginalization goes; if you don’t know what that looks like,
then perhaps <em>District 9</em> is worth a look. Stuff blows up a bunch and there’s
a ton of alien goop, so you won’t have to spend too much time learning.</p>
