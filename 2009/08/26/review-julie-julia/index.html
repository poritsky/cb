<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://cdn.sheknows.com/articles/julie-julia-amy-adams-knives.jpg" alt="" />A
cooking, blogging biopic is about the least interesting way I could imagine
spending a muggy summer afternoon. And yet, there I found myself, utterly
mystified by Nora Ephron’s Julie &amp; Julia, the story of two women who are
seemingly redeemed through the power of food alchemy. Featuring the second
delightful pairing of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci, the film is a phenomenal
take on the art of writing. In terms of scope, Ms. Ephron has pulled off a
monumental feet by taking the most boring thing in the world, sitting down and
putting pen to paper, mouse to blog, and pulling together a solid narrative
with thought-provoking implications.</p>

<p>Let’s start with those memorable performances. Mr. Tucci has long been
regarded as one of the finest (and fewest) character actors working today.
Consistently winning over our hearts with whatever minutes of screen-time he
can steal, the secret to his success is his embrace of being a bridesmaid,
never a bride. Here, he plays Paul Child the, loving, caring, pencil-thin
mustachioed husband to the as-yet famous Julia Child. That role is filled in
by Ms. Streep who crackles with energy. Long regarded as one of the finest
leading ladies in the biz, another dying breed, the actress seems to wish to
be demoted to the status Mr. Tucci enjoys. Her character work is ultimately
superb, in many ways out-sizing her front-and-center roles. Though she is
technically a lead here, I would argue that she is filling out a supporting
role with incredible finesse; Mrs. Child is ultimately a MacGuffin for the
modern blogger Julie Powell’s personal redemption.</p>

<p>We find our weathered hero, the aforementioned blogger who is played by Amy
Adams, making the move from Brooklyn to Queens in a city brought to it’s knees
after te attacks of September 11, 2001. Julie, a onetime proud member of the
Cobb salad eating literati, now finds herself answerig calls for the
buerecratic organization charged with rebuilding Lower Manhattan. Day in and
day out, she sits in er cubicle listening to the numerous sob stories that
befell New Yorkers in the wake of the attack. Food is her stress reliever. She
decries the mere fact that brownie batter will thicken every time she makes it
is a relief in a world where nothing is certain. The process, not the result,
is her redemption.</p>

<p>Enjoying the finer points of cooking isn’t quite enough for Julie, however.
She needs to break back into that crowd she once enjoyed membership in; she
needs to show up her skanky, yes skanky, blogging friend. And so an idea is
formed, obviously, to cook her way through Julia Child’s “Mastering the Art of
French Cooking” over the course of a year, blogging all the way. Meanwhile, in
the 1950s, Julia is struggling to find purpose in France where her husband is
employed and she is bored. Her search for meaning turns into the cook book in
question. And the wheel goes round!</p>

<p>As a blogger, I can attest to the film’s accuracies in the blogging space
(cyberspace, information superhighway for you real codgers out there). It’s
all there folks: the “me, me, me” problem, the wonder that is a good comments
system, the fear your boss will catch you in a lie, and most importantly the
unnatural connection between reader and writer. It can be very difficult to
put one’s finger on exactly what compels the daily blogger to stick to a game
that earns them zero cash. The film hits the nail on the head in this respect.
There is even a nod to the fact that the blogger’s printed counterpart, the
printed columnist, still wields a mighty sword (at least she did in 2002).</p>

<p>Where the film enters into some deliciously brainy noodling is in the
parallels between the times in which our title characters live. Both women
live in cities trying to put themselves back together after the ravages of
war. Both are afraid of Republicans. This has more to do, I assume, with Ms.
Ephron’s political leaning than anything else. For the Childs, the mighty hand
of the Republican comes crashing down in the form of Senator Joe McCarthy. For
Julie, there is a single line (“a Republican would fire you”) that shows us
her lefty-lean. I believe Ms. Ephron assumes her audience will see the jab at
President Bush and the Patriot Act, but this may fall flat in places other
than liberal hotbeds like New York. Nonetheless, the political subtext is
rampant in the film, though it hardly beats you over the head. Only eggs get
beaten in <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em>. (chortle)</p>

<p>Finally, the film is about the power that our imagination has to get us out of
even the most interminable of ruts. Late in the film, we learn that the “real”
Julia Child has learned of Julie’s blog and hates it. This rattles our
perception of the woman who gallivants about pretty ol’ Paris with a smile as
big as her sizable frame; of course it rattles Julie’s as well. As she comes
to terms with being hated by the hero who essentially handed her a career,
Julie realizes that the Julia in her mind is more important than the real one;
we reach the same conclusion. Julia and Paul Child as they appear in this film
are a myth. I don’t care if they are accurate to a T, the truth is that we
need legends, sometimes more than a real hero. I could go on and make the case
for the mythos that enveloped the nation in the months after the 9/11 attacks,
when the film takes place, but that is a completely different post.</p>

<p>As you may be able to tell from this near-thousand word post, <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em>
is a multi-faceted piece that has something for everyone. It is important to
note that this is far from a chick flick, and there is no rom-com aspect to
the film. Julie never gets her hair did to overcome loss; instead she is a
liberated woman who expresses her independence in the kitchen, feeding her
man.</p>
