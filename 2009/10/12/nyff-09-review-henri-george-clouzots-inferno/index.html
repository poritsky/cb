<p>Serge Bromberg &amp; Ruxandra Medrea, France, 2009</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/10/19100977.jpg" alt="Still from Henri-Georges Clouzot's Inferno" />I had never heard of Serge Bromberg
before I went to the New York Film Festival’s screening of his. I thought I
was going to see a restoration of a long lost film when I sat down to <em>Henri-
Georges Clouzot’s Inferno</em> at this year’s New York Film Festival. However,
once Serge Bromberg, the filmmaker behind this curious concoction, took the
stage to begin introduce the film, I learned that it was something else
entirely. Part documentary and part re-enactment, the film is an attempt to
understand Clouzot’s most ambitious failure, a film that would have been
called <em>Inferno</em>. and cinematic excavator who spent countless hours spelunking
the depths of notes, dailies and interviews with every living person connected
to the woebegone film, there simply wasn’t enough to resurrect Clouzot’s most
ambitious failure. Luckily, he recognized that the story of <em>Inferno</em> could
still be told even without all the elements of the original.</p>

<p>Built like a teddy bear with an unending charisma, Mr. Bromberg introduced his
film with a lengthy story that never really ended, his moderator futilely
giving him the wrap-it-up signal. As if with a professorial sleight-of-hand,
his tale ended with him waiting for an elevator with Clouzot’s widow, defeated
as she would not hand over her husband’s stockpile of footage. Once the film
rolled, the story picked right back up where Bromberg had left off, except now
in french. The two got stuck in that elevator and he managed to charm her as
he had us. This playfulness in the screening, one of the hallmarks of a
festival showing, made it quite obvious how the filmmaker gained access to the
extent he did. Still, even as good a cinematic excavator as he is, having
spent countless hours spelunking the depths of notes, dailies and interviews
with every living person connected to the woebegone film, we slowly learn that
there are many missing elements from the project.</p>

<p>The original film was basically the story of a husband who is driven mad by
thoughts of his wife cheating on him. It is unclear whether or not she is up
to anything untoward, but her hubby has nightmares of misdeeds nonetheless.
Already an international success, Mr. Clouzot was able to secure “unlimited”
financing for the project, which quickly became the highest budgeted French
film in history to that point. Ridden with problems ranging from time limits
with the location to sick cast members, the film never came to fruition. Where
this becomes so fascinating to film historians and nerds alike is the role
that Clouzot plays in the French cinema timeline. Originally celebrated, the
French New Wave critics derided him as part of the older school of filmmaking,
dismissing much of his work after the rise of the New Wave. Perhaps the
limtlessness of <em>Inferno</em> did him in, while the newer generation of
constrained filmmakers (small budgets, limited locations, etc.) flourished.</p>

<p>As the titles of both the documentary and the original film imply, the entire
endeavor was about a descent into madness. With his massive budget, Clouzot
began experimenting with some phenomenal special effects, many of which have
been restored for this documentary. I can’t quite describe how these tests
looked, but I can tell you that it is reminiscent of the great Geoffrey
Unsworth’s brilliant work on <em>Superman: The Movie</em> years later. (To give
credit where credit is due, Unsworth used some of Stan Brakhage’s
experimentations in that film, but if any of them could have seen
<em>Inferno</em>…) In one of the most amazing series of tests (illustrated above),
the team painted the actors various colors so they would look human once the
colors were chemically reversed. Initially this was to turn a river red, but
the amount of tests make it seem as though Clouzot had even more in mind.
Bright, ephemeral, and relentlessly inventive, the cinematography itself is
worth the peek if this film comes to your town.</p>

<p>Truth be told, the story that Mr. Bromberg cobbles together from the
breadcrumbs Clouzot left behind is not all that interesting. With his youthful
spirit and encyclopedic knowledge of film, he makes clear the excitement he
had diving into this lost treasure, but in the end there just isn’t enough to
keep our attention. Given that no audio was recovered, some scenes were staged
and cut with footage from the original. Essentially, the task was to spin hay
into gold, but only half the hay was there. An interesting little piece
indeed, but I would much rather have gone on the adventure myself, doubled
over film winders looking for clues to the masterpiece this genius could never
complete. But perhaps Clouzot was smarter than us all and knew that no matter
how out of the box he could go, <em>Inferno</em> would always be a fool’s errand.
Thankfully, Mr. Bromberg was enough of a fool to bring us something to chew
on.</p>
