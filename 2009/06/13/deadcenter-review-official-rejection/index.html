<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.mcnblogs.com/thehotblog/archives/rejection.jpg" alt="" />I feel inclined
to like Paul Osborne’s <em>Official Rejection</em>, but not because it is a good
film. As a film critic, I am drawn to any movie whose premise is that we
(filmmakers, critics, distributors, audience members, etc.) are all complicit
in a broken system. The film, which follows a number of filmmakers around the
festival circuit during the course of a year, is seemingly propagandizing the
concept that big name festivals are a scourge on independent filmmaking. They
take your hopes and dreams and money and make you feel like shit when they
reject you without cause or justifiation.</p>

<p>So yes, I liked it, because its heart. Mr. Osborne and his dedicated team
traverse the North American festival wasteland in search of fame and fortune,
but moreso recognition of any sort. A key player here is director Scott Storm,
whose film, <em> Ten ‘Til Noon</em>, is the main focus of the festival hopping. (Paul
Osborne also wrote that film) Broken up into segments which parallel the
process of distributing a film via the festival pipe, <em>Official Rejection</em> is
tight, funny and generally easy on the eyes. The film is mostly successful as
an educational tool for young filmmakers. It demystifies many of the paradigms
that they may think they understand, particularly the idea that a screening at
a festival is the first step to getting noticed, getting riches, getting
famous, etc.</p>

<p>Also, the filmmakers call attention to the importance of the camaraderie that
has become the lifeblood of many festivals. When you throw a bunch of
creatives into the same volatile foxhole, you are bound to hit on something
exciting, something electric. New relationships are forged, new perspectives
are discovered, and people come together in ways that they may never have done
under other circumstances.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the film’s greatest weakness: while trying to deconstruct
the horrors of the North American film festivals, Mr. Osborne and friends
become smitten with them. Their hatred of the majors brings them even closer
to the minor festivals, though I should say that Chicago’s IndieFest gets the
rawest deal of any of them in the film. I could amend that to say that feature
director Blayne Weaver gets the rawest deal, but you’ll have to see the film
to understand that reference. Nevertheless, no matter how much the filmmakers
tell us that the festival system is broken, they keep returning to it as the
same solution.</p>

<p>In my opinion (and you asked for it, that’s why you’re here), there must be a
better way to get your films out there, to reach an audience, than the same
old ways that we have relied on for decades. There is also no historical frame
of reference in this movie. It should be noted that as long as there has been
art, there have been critics; as long as there have been fests, there have
been anti-fests. This is not a new phenomenon, just one that has been
amplified by the prevalence of the equipment required to make a film. It is so
funny that the same people who wish to democratize cinema (filmmakers) will
end up getting burned by the inundation of new work being created faster,
quicker, and cheaper every single day. We want everyone to make a movie, just
not while we’re trying to sell ours.</p>

<p>All that ranting and raving aside, <em>Official Rejection</em> is a solid film that
all film enthusiasts should see. If you are not in the mood for a discussion
on the current state of cinema distribution, there is plenty for you to love
here. And if you are on the inside and you absolutely hate this film, well, at
least Paul Osborne has opened up the conversation.</p>
