<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.starpulse.com/Photos/Previews/Whatever-Works-
movie-18.jpg" alt="" />After 2004’s <em>Melinda and Melinda</em>, there were rumblings among
the faithfuls that follow Woody Allen’s every move that the master had lost
touch with the New York, that the film felt more like real estate porn, they
decried, than an actual New York story. We want the old Woody back, they
decried, we want to be enchanted by the greatest city in the world yet again!
Following a four film love affair with Europe, Mr. Allen returns home to the
big apple, but not to quell the masses. With _Whatever Works _he comes at us
swinging with a very clear message: that we should shut the hell up and let
him be.</p>

<p>The film opens with Boris Yellnikoff, a surly retired physicist played byLarry
David, sitting with a group of friends, prattling off some choice Woody Allen
favorites: the meaninglessness of life, the inherent evil within people, the
realization that everyone on earth is an idiot, and so on and so on. To wow
the die-hards even more, Boris stands up and directly addresses the audience,
launching into a monologue that feels mimeographed right out of <em>Annie Hall</em>.
Stylistically I have no problems with the way this fourth wall breakage
happens, it’s actually quite funny. The trouble is with our lead actor. When
Woody himself bares his soul in his 1977 Oscar-winner, there is an emotional
purity in his words; when Larry David does it today, he is trying to become
something he is not, an actor.</p>

<p>One stormy night, Boris finds a tight little coed, played with outdated
southern panache by Evan Rachel Wood, on his doorstep. Taking pity on her, he
lets her sleep on the couch, for a night, a week, a month, etc. Her name is
Melodie St. Ann Celestine, about as goyishe a name as Yellnikoff is shtetl-
born, and that’s the point. We have a caricature of the New York communist
self-hating Jew scientist and the wide-eyed dumb as dirt southern belle hard-
body thrown into the soup together. Hilarity would have to follow, yes?</p>

<p>Not exactly. As I touched on earlier, most of the trouble is with Mr. David.
He is a writer and producer whose comdic worth is on par with Woody’s. He has
made a name mainly by playing himself, a creative choice borne out of the
realization that he is not an actor. In his HBO series, <em>Curb Your
Enthusiasm</em>, this is all part of the joke. Here, it feels wholly out of place.</p>

<p>The problems may start with our star, but they don’t end there.
Cinematographer Harris Savides and editor Alisa Lepselter , of course under
the tutelage of their director, have dealt this film a one two punch by
showing us a great deal of the frame and holding each shot longer than
necessary. This is extremely common in Woody Allen films, especially ones as
theatrical as <em>Whatever Works</em>, but it puts an incredible onus on our actors.
Ms. Wood seems to have spent so much time toning her accent and her abs that
she forgot about destination. She is lost in that massive frame. Thank
goodness Patricia Clarkson comes along to play her mother, Marietta. Unlike
her young counterpart, Ms. Clarkson slips into the N’Orleans mentality and
lights up the screen; she is larger than life in this role. Also of note is
the always hilarious Ed Begley Jr. who builds one of the most interesting
characters in the film with very little screen time.</p>

<p><em>Whatever Works</em> feels dated, slow and hackneyed. If there is a lesson to be
learned, and I fully believe this is the film’s intention, it is that the New
York City of yore (the 1970s and 1980s) is gone and has been replaced with
something glitzier. Gotham is no longer a place where huddled masses of
artisans, architects and other right-brain types can commingle on a pittance a
day. These days you need capital, both monetarily and fashionably, to stay
afloat in this town.</p>

<p>Woody Allen is breaking our reverie, this so-called love-affair with Manhattan
that audiences are obsessed with. When you ask the wrong questions, he is
telling us, you will get a lame answer. Why don’t you make films like you used
to, Woody? Because they don’t work anymore, idiots. It may seem like
intellectual apologism to say that Woody has a message in this malformed film,
but I think the writing is as clear as day. He is a cinematic master who
continues to grow with every film he makes (despite popular belief, he has
never had a slow period), so just leave him be to make the films he wants,
wherever they may be.</p>
