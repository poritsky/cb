<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/dsc_3094.jpg" alt="Director Nati Baratz" />On a rainy Friday afternoon, I managed to
spend some time with Israeli filmmaker Nati Baratz. We met at Manhattan’s Film
Forum, where his film, <em>Unmistaken Child</em>, began it’s U.S. theatrical tour
last Wednesday and will be playing there through Tuesday, June 16th. Clutching
an umbrella that flopped in and out which he offered me as a canopy
repeatedly, he and I chatted about his career, his film, and the current state
of documentary cinema.</p>

<p>The film is his first theatrical venture. A graduate of Tel Aviv University’s
film program, Mr. Baratz made two documentaries for television, but as he
tells it, he was a hired gun on those projects, taking them on in an effort to
keep his chops up. <em>Unmistaken Child</em> follows the buddhist monk Tenzin Zopa on
his search for the reincarnation of his late master, Geshe Lama Konchong. For
more specifics, you can read <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/06/04/review-unmistaken-child/">the candler blog’s
review</a>, but
you would do better to just go see the film.</p>

<p>We began to discuss the positive critical reception of his film, though Mr.
Baratz was quick to point out that not all viewers are pleased with his work.
“ Some people want me to give answers, to give explanations, like more
conventional documetaries. This is fair enough, but it’s not the film I
made.”He’s right. <em>Unmistaken Child</em> features only sparse interviews with the
main subject, Mr. Zopa, and a handful of overlayed text, giving the viewer the
bare minimum of literal context. “People want me to criticize things, to go
deeper. Most don’t even realize how much information there actually is in the
piece, because I made this for Westerners, not Buddhists.”</p>

<p>In 1993, Nati Baratz took his first trip to Tibet and was immediately
enchanted. “I liked the people. Then, after that, I liked the Buddhism. I am
not a Buddhist, but I like their philosophy, their psychology.” He was
initially drawn to Tibet because of the civil rights deadlock that that nation
has been in with China, though this is not evidenced in his film. I asked him
why, if this is so important to him, is there no political edge to his film.
“My way of making activist cinema is something I learned from Buddhism. If you
shout and if you blame, then you only get in return blames and shouting. So I
don’t think this kind of activist movie does good work. My film is activist in
a Buddhist way. I just show the beauty, I show the quality of the Tibetans.
There is a drama. There are also very hard scenes, not everything is nice and
happy, not at all. There are also things that people can criticize the
Tibetans about doing, but overall, when you follow Tenzin Zopa, an
extraordinary human being, then I think the general effect is affection toward
the Tibetan people. This is my way of making activist cinema.”</p>

<p>For five years, <em>Unmistaken Child</em> was the centerpiece of Mr. Baratz’s life.
He moved his family to India halfway through shooting in an effort to save
money on airfare. Due to an agreement he had made early on with Tenzin Zopa,
he was unable to show the footage to anyone for the first two years of
shooting, so the project was completely self-financed. At the beginning,
naturally, he was scared. Mr. Zopa would only allow Nati access if he would
agree to see the process through to completion, no matter how long it would
take to find the reincarnation. However, he found relief once Mr. Zopa
encountered a young boy also named Tenzin, who would become the focal point of
the film’s search for the reincarnated master. “When I returned with these
rushes, I knew that everything would be fine. I knew I had a film that would
be great, that I could only screw it up. From that moment, I invested
everything I had.”</p>

<p>I told Mr. Baratz that his film is the first Israeli film I can think of to
cross the Atlantic that is neither in Hebrew nor Starring Israelis. He
laughed. “I had no idea, I am not an expert on this.” Anytime I would bring up
his nationality, the conversation would quickly veer in another direction. Mr.
Baratz views himself as a citizen of the world. When I drew the parallel
between the situation in the Middle East and the situation in Tibet, he was
taken aback, as though the parallel had never occurred to him. “The endless
cycle of blood in Israel really frustrates you; you feel really hopeless, so
you are looking for a breakthrough. For me, that breakthrough was g0ing to
Tibet. To see the Tibetans’ non-violent struggle for independence, it’s
amazingly inspiring for someone coming from the Middle East.”</p>

<p>As for Mr. Baratz’s influences for making this film, he repeatedly invoked the
names of Robert Flaherty and John Grierson when asked about it. “I like their
documentary tradition, spending a long times in places, getting to know
people. Flaherty and Grierson also dramatized their films without narration.
What I am doing now is going back to the roots of documentary.” In general,
however, he has been influenced more by fiction films than by non-fiction.
“Let me tell you something surprising. One inspiration for this ?lm was Dogme
95, specifically <em>Breaking the Waves</em> by Von Trier. The feeling, the fact that
it doesn?t matter if you use simple camera. The thing that matters is the way
you think of the frames.”</p>

<p>During a question and answer session at one of the recent screenings, Nati
mentioned <em>Star Wars</em> as another influence. He smiles. “ I use a classic
narrative myth. <em>Hero with A Thousand Faces</em> by Joseph Campbell. It?s
classical Joseph Campbell structure. The hero is in his ordinary world. His
master dies. He is called to a mission. He refuses to go to the mission. Then
mentors come and teach him how to go. Then he goes. You can just see the
structure. Of course you play with it because the culture is so different and
I had so many gaps to ?ll.”</p>

<p>We had been chatting in the Film Forum lobby as the crowd lined up to see his
film. An usher came and asked, loudly, for all people in line to see
<em>Unmistaken Child</em> to please squeeze in against the wall to make room for
more. “This is all for <em>Unmistaken Child</em>?” Mr. Baratz asked, wide-eyed and
curious. “Good.” In hoping for a sold out crowd, he is not at all concerned
with his box office appeal. The film is doing fine business and has received
awards and praise the world over. Instead, he scans the crowd as a man on a
mission. “The film has already been picked up by major television stations.
Millions and millions will spend 104 minutes with Tenzin Zopa, so it’s great.
After seeing this film, I believe they will keep a small place in their hearts
for the Tibetan people.”</p>

<p>“I am naive,” he went on to say, “in a way, you have to be to make documentary
films; to make films in general. I want to change the world. I hope, in my
lifetime, Tibet will get independence in a peaceful way. I believe the world
will benefit so much from it, really. I’m not just saying that.” It is not
hard to believe a man that has devoted a great chunk of his life to this
cause. “End the article like this:” he told me, a smile coming across his
face. “Let us hope that Tibet will get independence in our lifetime, in this
reincarnation.” There is an honesty and an irony in his wording. To fully
understand it, you really must see this breathtaking film.</p>

<p>Unmistaken Child <em>is playing through Tuesday, June 16th at Film Forum in New
York. It will open wider in different cities in the cming weeks. <a href="http://www.UnmistakenChild.com/">For more
