<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Guest poster Sunrise Tippeconnie is a filmmaker currently living in Oklahoma
City. He is an old friend of the candler blog who also dabbles in film
criticism and history. You can read more of his work in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sooner-Cinema-Oklahoma-
Goes-Movies/dp/0981710514/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1249039848&amp;sr=8-1">Sooner Cinema:
Oklahoma Goes to the Movies</a>.
We hope to see more of Sunrise on the candler blog in the future.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/arts/photos/2009/07/30/arts-funny-
people-584.jpg" alt="" />There are three questions that immediately come up about this
picture. 1. Is it a “passing of the torch” film? 2. Is it film a masterpiece?
3. Is it funny?</p>

<p>Let’s answer the last question first. <em>Funny People</em> is exactly what the title
suggests, it is about people, and not about being funny. To be direct, the
film is funny but it is definitely not a [traditional] comedy. In fact the
concept of the film being a comedy (specifically a crossbreed of two
subgenres: the Adam Sandler and the Judd Apatow comedy) is a complex idea that
reaches into anthropologic study in the vein of the Hal Ashby’s <em>Being There</em>.
Sandler’s character George Simmons finds out in one of the first (and almost
rushed) scenes at blank range that he has cancer. Comedy and death immediately
call up another analysis of a comedic master: Chaplin in <em>Monsiuer Verdoux</em>
(and we all know how the audience loved that film, despite it’s ranking as a
masterpiece).</p>

<p>Yet, while the themes of death reign, Apatow’s analysis yields that being a
star in the Hollywood system provides no success in finding the “happy ending”
designed in any of the films actually made within it. In fact, any happy
ending that resides within <em>Funny People</em> is tragedy in disguise, which of
course is the true root of the finest comedy, and just happens to suggest that
any “torch-bearing” carries with it the false promises of infinity.</p>

<p>Just as the walls of the film are lined with creative greats from Jimi Hendrix
to Rodney Dangerfield, the time of these greats has passed and there will be
no other like them. This does not mean that there was any attempt at torch-
passing, there might just be someone whom believes that Lenny Kravitz is
reincarnation, but most of us do not, and Funny People says that is okay. In
fact the film, following the rules of a Sandler comedy, provides great
comedian cameos, although they function so much more eloquently: Paul Reiser’s
discussion of missed limelight over making his family laugh is no real
conflict for him at all, and that in fact reveals the great truth of any
Sandler film: life is the most important thing after family.</p>

<p>As Simmons struggles to comprehend the true worth of life, Seth Rogen’s
character, Ira Wright, is introduced to these ideas early in his attempts to
climb the star ladder so that he can find salvation before falling into the
star-fucker trap he sees in his idol Simmons. So to answer the first question:
Seth Rogen’s character Ira Wright does not like the choices he must make to
survive in the world of successful Hollywood stars, even though he is on the
verge of stardom himself. After the end of the film there is a good chance
that his character might walk away from the trappings of Hollywood success for
things that be believes in more: doing the right thing (which in the case of
any Sandler film is proving that solidification of family is more important
than any “success” implied by a “happy ending”).</p>

<p>Sandler walking away from this film with no one to carry on a legacy is a hard
thing to digest when everyone should be laughing and the set-up suggests such
a torch-passing. Cancer <em>is</em> on the mind, and it’s a slow death by show-
business. Any implications that someone is going to get laid in the film also
carries with it the strain of “star-fucker”, the strange compulsion that
copulation with someone famous brings you closer to something infinite. There
is literally nothing further than the truth, and every character in the film
searches for this physical equivalent for the infinite, when it only resides
in a connection that holds no potential for such a “star-fucker” relationship.
When the fragile state of Simmons’ and Wright’s friendship comes to terms with
the possibility of end, there is no struggle to maintain stardom and the
“happy ending” dreams of immortality.</p>

<p>Yet, the final implications of Apatow’s analysis suggests that comedy serves
not a as a device for escape from pain, but a constant reminder that these
pains are just as much a part of life as the joys that life can bring. Again,
the rules of a Sandler picture ring. If his picture can call both the pain and
joy to mind over the formalistic and historic properties of comedy (or film),
then any Sandler film is a masterpiece. [Of course it’s a little too late to
tell you that I am biased about question number two, since “Adam Sandler” is a
hero of mine because all his works remind me more about life than anything
else (again, like Chaplin). Sorry, question number two was no fair, since it
was a trick question.]</p>
