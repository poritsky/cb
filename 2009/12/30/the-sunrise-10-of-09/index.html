<div class="entry-content"><p>Although I detest the idea of lists, I thought I would mention “10” films that
convey an amazing articulation of contemporary culture (and they just happen
to be a some that I find as my favorites of this year).</p>

<p>_ _</p>

<p><em>Birdsong</em> (Albert Serra)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Birdsong1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The limits of plot are less a concern than the grace of an event’s miraculous
and personal unfolding for an individual. While the film conveys the infamous
birth of a religious figure in a manner that is rooted in secular mortality,
the film focuses on the personal contemplation and expressionistic moments
inspired by the meaning of the event rather than expository dialog about
religious convictions. Amazingly brave in its contemplative execution, Serra
continues to allude to things beyond the nature of cinema’s plastics and
today’s climate of physicality, technology and the literal.</p>

<p><em>Fearne and…Peaches Geldof</em> (Iain Thompson)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Fearne1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The exuberant and excessive brit-pop culture anthropologist Fearne Cotton
interviews the walking symbol of pseudo-modernist globalization: Peaches
Geldof. While dismissed as another tabloid celebrity, Peaches is fascinating
for the very fact that she is the end result of an over-saturated culture of
mediated capitalism, and this “investigative” documentary defines a strange
paradox behind the vapid meaning of today’s pop-psych justified Global-
capitalist-culture. Like it, or hate it, this is the fascinating actualization
of Godard’s chapter entitled “Dialogue with a Consumer Product” in <em>Masculine
Feminine</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Girlfriend Experience</em> (Steven Soderbergh)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/the_girlfriend_experience1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Speaking of Godard, Soderbergh perfects the mediated analogy of prostitution
in the modern commodification of women through his study of Sasha Grey. While
the film situates this classic genre within the American bail-out crisis and,
as such, does adhere to a cold execution of facts, Soderbergh does not derail
enough to miss the true emotional pain in the mediation and sale of women.
Though his choices may appear simple, they are bold, and his genius comes
through in his ability to convey an articulate analysis immediately!</p>

<p><em>Julia</em> (Erick Zonca)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/julia1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Zonca’s very quiet and confident character study of an American woman on the
verge of drug-craved financial crisis overcomes the somewhat conventional
narrative approach. The strengths of this film is in Zonca’s ability to draft
a such a strong and weighty character through Tilda Swinton in a time when
character goes overlooked in the seemingly popular didactic plot-driven
approach of contemporary political cinema.</p>

<p>_Martyrs _(Pascal Laugier)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/martyrs1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While Laugier’s  film appropriates horror conventions in a tale of secret
sadistic torture, it does so to provide for a strong critique of voyeurism in
the vein of Haneke’s <em>Funny Games</em>. Laugier’s film depicts a complicated
emotional analysis of the victimization in torture for exploratory and
vicarious spectatorship that implicitly deconstructs the decade’s cinematic
obsession with flesh-horrors such as Roth’s <em>Hostel</em> or Wan’s <em>Saw</em> series. In
the end, Laguier’s point verges on satiric ambiguity as the responsibility of
viewership results in appropriate self-disgust that should follow this trend.</p>

<p>nbc.com/yoteach  / <em>Funny People</em> (Judd Apatow)</p>

<p>While not necessarily a film, the NBC website gave room for the <em>Funny People</em>
viral campaign that rose above simple advertising.  A fascinating and
illuminating commentary about television’s mediation and appropriations of
cultural stereotypes, the YoTeach site holds clips from a fictitious NBC show
that address issues such as teen pregnancy and internet stalkers. The strength
of the commentary resides in a biting satire that questions television’s
oversimplification and commodification of real American issues. The false
solutions found in the false sitcom clips address the limits of the media’s
antiquated means of conversation.</p>

<p>_Pontypool _(Bruce McDonald)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/Pontypool1.jpg"><img src="http://www.poritsky.com/thecandlerblog/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/Pontypool1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Always the popular genre, the zombie film is used as a means of understanding
the elusive horrors of today’s loss of meaning in the use of English language.
The confusing concept is amazingly handled by McDonald’s ability to navigate
through abstract concepts in the appropriate and accessible moment-to-moment
zombie trap. The strength of the film lies in the imperceptible way terror
hints its way into our lives before we know with what we are dealing –the real
scare effect that recalls the initial moment of cinematic zombies, before they
loss their scare-factor.</p>

<p><em>Sauna</em> (Antti-Jussi Annila)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Sauna.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Annila’s film depicts the imperceptible horrors associated with intangible
powers behind religious convictions. While the film’s depiction of 16th
Century Occidental landscape can be distancing, Annila’s able to amazingly
manifest the horrors behind the question of another’s belief system overcoming
your own facilities and rationale behind your own convictions. In what feels
like an Ingmar Bergman horror, <em>Sauna</em> hauntingly reverberates the horrifying
questions of a higher intelligence’s wrath through something as simple as an
accidental murder in a border-town.</p>

<p><em>Two Legged Horse</em> (Samira Mahkmalbaf)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/two-legged-
horse.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The daughter of Iranian cinema master Mohsen Mahkmalbaf, Samira takes her
place as his successor with this complex portrait of victimization. A young
man plays “horse” to a boy whom is unable to use his legs, and becomes a
poetic metaphor for mistreatment by those whom take advantage of their
positions of power. The disabled young boy mistreats his “horse” and enacts
some of the most disturbing abuses committed to film this year. Strongly
calling for real-life action beyond the confines of this sensitive, yet
intensely scarring film, Samira has places herself among the most important
political filmmakers working today.</p>

<p><em>Whatever Works</em> (Woody Allen)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/whatever-works.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The grand comedic artist returns to American to provide a simple update of the
neurosis of contemporary Americana. While Larry David is prominent, he is
merely the vehicle through which Allen is able to deconstruct the apprehension
Americans have about finding comfort in the overcomplication of sex roles. The
real resolve is in trusting happiness can exist without hope, and that love’s
overly complicated depiction is simply to validate itself when the humanity
remains within its clichés.</p>
