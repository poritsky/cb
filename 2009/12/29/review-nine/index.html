<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/daniel-day-lewis-
nine.jpg" alt="" />Fetishism is the first word that comes to mind when considering Rob
Marshall’s newest musical film, <em>Nine</em>. Take your pick of which element is
fetishized: Europe, the 1960s, cinema, Penélope Cruz, etc. This isn’t
necessarily a bad thing. It’s actually quite an accurate read of how we now
view the work of Federico Fellini and his peers. The filmmaker, on whose <em>8 ½</em>
the 1982 musical, and by proxy this film, is based is known not only for his
mastery of film language but for his keen eye for style. Of course, Fellini’s
film was not a musical, but a backstage circus in the life of a woebegone
director. Converting it to a stage musical must have been daunting enough, but
bringing it back to the screen is something of a chore.</p>

<p>Daniel Day-Lewis is Guido Contini, the Italian director whose next film is
sold as being his return to his glory days. The problem is that he hasn’t
written it yet, and from the outset we learn he begins shooting in ten days.
He is also a womanizer, haunted by the dream versions of the real women in his
life. Though he is surrounded by men, it is the women who serves as his muses,
for better or worse. Day-Lewis brings not only his uncanny abilities of vocal
interpretation but also an incredible physicality to the Italian auteur.
Gliding across the screen, he feels ten feet tall atop legs made of feathers.
Sure, he’s no Fred Astaire, but if someone asked him to he could probably pull
that off too.</p>

<p>Just as Fellini’s <em>8 ½</em> was a backstage film, this is a backstage musical.
Nearly all of the numbers, in at least some capacity, take place on a
soundstage that exists in the main character’s mind. Well, it’s also the set
of his upcoming film, but really it’s just in his mind. The trouble is that
this gimmick falls flat for a few reasons. First off, the musical numbers do
little to move the story forward, even emotionally. Almost every single song
deals with how much of a failure Guido has become later in life. If you had to
take a shot every time the name Guido was uttered in a song, you’d be dead by
the third reel. These indulgences would be fine if we actually learned
anything useful about the character, but we know just about everything up
front.</p>

<p>On top of that, some of the songs are just complete failures, such as Kate
Hudson’s “Cinema Italiano”. This number, a hippy dippy boogaloo of sorts, is
so boring musically, so conceptually flawed and so out of place in this film,
the only consolation the viewer has is that it was written exclusively for the
film. Meaning theatergoers were spared this insanity. On the other had, the
showstopper of the bunch, Fergie’s “Be Italian”, is catchy enough to get stuck
in your head and choreographed quite nicely for the stage, but fails to wow on
screen. If I were watching the sandy tambourining live, I’d be enthralled, but
it just doesn’t translate to cinema.</p>

<p>The only number that stands out is “I Can’t Make this Movie”, which features
Day-Lewis singing in front of a film screen playing dailies from the film
within a film. He feels hauntingly close to the audience in this instance, as
if he is in the room sharing a moment with us. No doubt this will translate
nicely to Americans’ new HDTVs when this hits Blu Ray. Ironically  Also of
note is Marion Cotillard’s “Take it All”, the only song that feels emotionally
motivated in the whole piece.</p>

<p>Rob Marshall certainly lead the movement towards musical cinema early in the
2000s with <em>Chicago</em>, a film whose success launched a number of Broadway
adaptations. I would have loved to have seen this show on Broadway under Mr.
Marshall’s tutelage, but alas we have the film instead. It’s neither a very
good musical nor a very good movie, but I believe audiences are still yearning
for the return to musical cinema, so they will welcome this addition of
something different.</p>
