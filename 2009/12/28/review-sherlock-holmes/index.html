<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/sherlock_holmes_warner_bros_pictures_2.jpg" alt="" />In case
your great aunt’s fruitcake wasn’t stale enough this holiday season (as stale
as fruitcake jokes, perhaps?), head to the theater where you can get an eyeful
of the same-old-same-old in Guy Ritchie’s unbearably boring <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>.
The title character, a literary invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of
the few who is yet to find a modern home on the silver screen as the decade of
franchises comes to a close. Having seen Superman, Spiderman, James Bond and
the Star Trek crew get a bigscreen reboot in the aughts, the next ten years
will be dominated by bottom of the barrel heroes who have had a cultural
(read: box office) impact in other generations. So before you line up in 2010
for <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, enter the good inspector Holmes and his devoted
sidekick, Dr. Watson.</p>

<p>Though most fans will agree that the cadaverous Basil Rathbone’s portrayal of
the master sleuth is the truest, it is difficult to deny that Robert Downey
Jr. is more than adequately equipped to carry the torch. He certainly throws
the kitchen sink at the role, though there isn’t much for the gifted thesp to
work with. Penned by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon
Kinberg, this iteration of the Londoner gumshoe has little more than pecks to
hang his hat on. Trained with the precision of a Kung Fu master, Holmes’
newfound brutish strenghth may be the result of deductive reasoning, but he is
a brute nonetheless. Planting blows where words fail him, this Holmes is more
a man of action than any that came before him, which wouldn’t be such a bad
thing if his intellect didn’t feel like such an afterthought.</p>

<p>Then there is Mr. Holmes’ devoted sidekick, Dr. Watson, here portrayed by Jude
Law. The once sodden right arm of our hero has now come into his own, matching
his partner wit for wit, blow for blow. Personally I’m glad to see Watson
being used as more than a crumbcake sounding board, but the trouble is that he
is too close to Holmes in every way. The skepticism and protestations are
still there, but only glancingly. This Watson could go into private practice
and he wouldn’t be missing much.</p>

<p>Instead of calling into question the culture of homophobia that pervades
action cinema (a la <em>Casino Royale</em>), Mr. Ritchie takes the opposite route and
just makes fun of the co-dependent crime solvers. Sure, each has a skirt to
chase after in the film, but when push comes to shove they always choose each
other. I can almost hear the director nudging the ribs of adolescent boys ages
15-55, whispering, “Aren’t they so gay for each other? It’s okay to laugh.”
What’s all the more annoying in all of this is that Holmes’ sexuality, gay
straight or otherwise, is a completely missed opportunity here. Downey is
Downey so he exudes a raw sensuality, but I would have preferred him to
smolder. We are instead slogged through these goofy fits of wink-wink-nudge-
nudge as he chases after an out-of place Rachel McAdams for no reason.</p>

<p>Plot? Psht, don’t worry about plot here. Some jerk is trying to take over
England or the world or something. Had the studio come to me in advance I
could have advised they keep the nefariousness to a minimum and build
character. Perhaps a serial killer would have been nice, but instead we have a
fabulous magician (Mark Strong) leading a pack of fabulous Britons to some
kind of fabulous display of, uh, manhood?</p>

<p>Finally, the visuals. The film is nothing if not stylized. Fashioned after a
newspaper of the day, the colors are awash and some kind of muck sits between
us and the film onscreen. It’s something between <em>Harry Potter _and _300</em>. In
an effort to bring us back to merry old London, Mr. Ritchie and
cinematographer Phillippe Rousselot have filled the screen with digitally
enhanced everything, which is certainly one way to go, though not one I enjoy
sitting through. Sometimes it works, sometimes not so much.</p>

<p>Any time a character is brought to a new generation, there are undoubtedly
changes that will appease new audiences and frustrate traditionalists. That
Sherlock Holmes is now in his second century of pop relevance is no small
feat, and the truth is that this film has sealed the interest of the next
generation of filmgoers and readers. There is no doubt that we will see more
of these films in years to come. One can only hope that whoever makes the next
films will bring the character out of the slump this film represents; there
isn’t anywhere to go but up.</p>
