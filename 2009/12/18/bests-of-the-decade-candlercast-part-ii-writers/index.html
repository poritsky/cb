<div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing our discussion of the last decade, Sunrise and I move on to the
best writers ofthe decade. To reiterate, instead of making a definitive list,
we have opted to simply name a person we think is deserving, and discuss their
competition and why they came out on top.</p>

<p>The term “best of the decade” should be defined. We are not just looking for
someone whose creative output was particularly impressive over the last 10
years. Instead, in all the categories we discuss we are looking for someone
who is the best <em>for</em> the decade, someone who was as important to the aughts
as the aughts were to him/her.</p>

<p>The best way to explain is to tell you who our Best Writers of the Decade are
(sorry, Sunrise and I couldn’t agree so there are two), since I absolutely
despise one of the writers we chose. But it’s not about me, it’s about all of
us.</p>

<p>[podcast]http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bests-of-the-
decade-part-ii-writers.mp3[/podcast] <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bests-of-the-

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/haggis.jpg" alt="Paul Haggis" />Paul Haggis does not make movies the
candler blog enjoys, and we are particularly upset about <em>Crash’s</em> pop status.
However, he has had an impressive decade, snagging two Oscars and garnering
tons of attention for projects. Seemingly overnight he became an A-list
scribe, tapping into the most insecure bits of the American subconcious. It
was eerie how close <em>Million Dollar Baby’s</em> release was to the Terri Schiavo
ordeal in the news. He was raised almost to shaman status for bringing one of
the country’s hottest controversies to the screen. He remade James Bond in his
own image this decade, introducing is to a darker, more homoerotic version of
the 1960s über spy. In other words, he successfully moved him into our time.</p>

<p>For all his transgressions, Paul Haggis has that rare talent of making us
prick up our ears and listen to what he has to say. A gifted, if formulaic,
storyteller, it is difficult to ignore the massive impact he has had
throughout the 2000s.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.candlerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12
/next-tradesecrets2.jpg" alt="Director Tony Gilroy" />Our other choice for best writer is Tony Gilroy, who
has become one of the hottest new directors as we close out the aughts.
Although he is no stranger to penning scripts, he really moved his career in a
new direction this decade when he adapted Robert Ludlum’s <em>The Bourne
Identity</em> to the big screen. Although the first film in the series, directed
by Doug Liman, packed a powerful oomph for a Hollywood unsure of how to make
an action film after 9/11, but it wasn’t until the subsequent sequels, <em>The
Bourne Supremacy</em> and <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em> that we really saw something very
special come together. The two films, but written by Gilroy and directed by
Paul Greengrass, stand out as major progressions in action filmmaking,
essentially creating a new mold for a 21st century action hero.</p>

<p>Also moving into the directing field, Mr. Gilroy got a Best Director
nomination for his first outing at the helm with <em>Michael Clayton</em>, a
brilliant legal thriller starring George Clooney. Though he didn’t win, he
came back very strong this year with <em>Duplicity</em>, a screwball thriller that
<a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2009/03/28
/review-duplicity/">really wowed me back when it came out</a>. In both cases, the stories are very simple and classical,
but the context is wholly 21st century, which is where Tony Gilroy’s gift
lies. Not afraid to bring current geopolitical trends into even his most
mundane of projects, his work never crosses the line into preachy (unlike our
other best of the decader). We truly can’t wait to see where he takes things
in the next decade.</p>

<p>In the recording, Sunrise and I mention many other notable writers, but two
that are worth mentioning as our runners up are Jim Jarmusch and Judd Apatow.
Sunrise states that Jarmusch is consistently left out of such discussions,
especially as a writer since he is know mostly for his directing, because his
films aren’t successful enough. The growth of Jarmusch’s narrative structure
over the last 10 years is, perhaps, more notable than any other working
writer. The other person of note is Judd Apatow, who went from being a failed
television producer to the most powerful name in Hollywood in the 2000s.
Keeping his growing gang of followers close to him, one can’t go more than 3
months without seeing a film that his pen touched anymore. Love him or hate
him, his brand of comedy/masculine self-discovery has changed the way an
entire generation of filmgoers look at funny movies.</p>
